### [1] [Pathological Truth Bias in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22674)
*Yash Thube*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了MATS（多模态真实性空间化审计），用于评估视觉语言模型在视觉矛盾语句上的表现，发现生成式模型表现较差，而对比式模型更稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准基准测试可能掩盖系统性问题，影响实际应用中的信任度。

Method: 提出MATS审计方法，包括SCS和IAR两个指标，并通过激活修补定位失败原因。

Result: 生成式VLMs（如LLaVA 1.5）表现较差，对比式模型（如CLIP）更稳健。

Conclusion: 激活修补揭示了失败的具体原因，并提出了修复路径。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are improving quickly, but standard benchmarks
can hide systematic failures that reduce real world trust. We introduce MATS
(Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that
measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two
metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR).
Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS
and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust.
Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross
attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive
models) and suggests concrete repair paths.

### [2] [Scale and Rotation Estimation of Similarity-Transformed Images via Cross-Correlation Maximization Based on Auxiliary Function Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22686)
*Shinji Yamashita,Yuma Kinoshita,Hitoshi Kiya*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种高效算法，用于联合估计图像间的尺度和旋转变化，精度达亚像素级。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像对齐在医学影像和计算机视觉中至关重要，但传统相位相关技术无法有效处理尺度和旋转变化。

Method: 基于对数极坐标傅里叶变换和互相关最大化策略，结合辅助函数方法，实现亚像素级精度。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在尺度和旋转估计上的平均误差低于传统基于离散互相关的傅里叶变换技术。

Conclusion: 新算法在尺度和旋转估计上表现优越，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a highly efficient algorithm capable of jointly
estimating scale and rotation between two images with sub-pixel precision.
Image alignment serves as a critical process for spatially registering images
captured from different viewpoints, and finds extensive use in domains such as
medical imaging and computer vision. Traditional phase-correlation techniques
are effective in determining translational shifts; however, they are inadequate
when addressing scale and rotation changes, which often arise due to camera
zooming or rotational movements. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm
that integrates scale and rotation estimation based on the Fourier transform in
log-polar coordinates with a cross-correlation maximization strategy,
leveraging the auxiliary function method. By incorporating sub-pixel-level
cross-correlation our method enables precise estimation of both scale and
rotation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
lower mean estimation errors for scale and rotation than conventional Fourier
transform-based techniques that rely on discrete cross-correlation.

### [3] [Robust Object Detection for Autonomous Driving via Curriculum-Guided Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22688)
*Xu Jia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种强化学习框架，结合GRPO、课程数据调度和难度感知过滤，提升多模态检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在结构化感知任务中定位不精确和鲁棒性不足的问题。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，结合GRPO、课程数据调度和难度感知过滤，优化稀疏和噪声奖励下的训练。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中显著提升了检测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 强化驱动的优化结合结构化数据课程是提升多模态检测鲁棒性和可解释性的有效途径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel in vision-language reasoning
but often struggle with structured perception tasks requiring precise
localization and robustness. We propose a reinforcement learning framework that
augments Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with curriculum-based data
scheduling and difficulty-aware filtering. This approach stabilizes
optimization under sparse, noisy rewards and enables progressive adaptation to
complex samples. Evaluations on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in detection accuracy and robustness. Ablation studies
confirm the importance of reward design, KL regularization, and curriculum
pacing for convergence stability and generalization. Our findings highlight
reinforcement-driven optimization with structured data curricula as a scalable
path toward robust and interpretable multimodal detection.

### [4] [Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22689)
*Ha-Hieu Pham,Minh Le,Han Huynh,Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le,Huy-Hieu Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TGC框架通过图论约束提升半监督语义分割性能，在5-10%监督下达到SOTA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法因像素级一致性导致的噪声伪标签和拓扑无效分割问题。

Method: 提出Topology Graph Consistency (TGC)，通过对齐拉普拉斯谱、组件数和邻接统计来约束全局拓扑。

Result: 在GlaS和CRAG数据集上，TGC在低监督下显著提升分割精度，接近全监督效果。

Conclusion: TGC有效整合拓扑约束，显著提升半监督分割性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational
pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods
often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and
produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph
Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by
aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between
prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves
segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC
achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly
narrows the gap to full supervision. Code is available at
https://github.com/hieuphamha19/TGC.

### [5] [A review of Recent Techniques for Person Re-Identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22690)
*Andrea Asperti,Salvatore Fiorilla,Simone Nardi,Lorenzo Orsini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文综述了监督和无监督行人重识别（ReID）的最新进展，指出监督方法已接近性能极限，而无监督方法正展现出潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督方法依赖大量标注数据，成本高且难以扩展，而无监督方法利用未标注数据，性能逐渐接近监督方法，因此值得深入研究。

Method: 论文首先回顾并分类了监督ReID的重要文献，然后重点分析了近三年无监督ReID的最新进展和趋势。

Result: 监督ReID性能提升空间有限，而无监督ReID的性能差距正在缩小，显示出与监督方法趋同的潜力。

Conclusion: 该综述为行人重识别领域提供了全面的视角，强调了无监督方法的未来发展方向及其可能带来的性能突破。

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReId), a crucial task in surveillance, involves
matching individuals across different camera views. The advent of Deep
Learning, especially supervised techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks
and Attention Mechanisms, has significantly enhanced person Re-ID. However, the
success of supervised approaches hinges on vast amounts of annotated data,
posing scalability challenges in data labeling and computational costs. To
address these limitations, recent research has shifted towards unsupervised
person re-identification. Leveraging abundant unlabeled data, unsupervised
methods aim to overcome the need for pairwise labelled data. Although
traditionally trailing behind supervised approaches, unsupervised techniques
have shown promising developments in recent years, signalling a narrowing
performance gap. Motivated by this evolving landscape, our survey pursues two
primary objectives. First, we review and categorize significant publications in
supervised person re-identification, providing an in-depth overview of the
current state-of-the-art and emphasizing little room for further improvement in
this domain. Second, we explore the latest advancements in unsupervised person
re-identification over the past three years, offering insights into emerging
trends and shedding light on the potential convergence of performance between
supervised and unsupervised paradigms. This dual-focus survey aims to
contribute to the evolving narrative of person re-identification, capturing
both the mature landscape of supervised techniques and the promising outcomes
in the realm of unsupervised learning.

### [6] [Sequential Token Merging: Revisiting Hidden States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22691)
*Yan Wen,Peng Ye,Lin Zhang,Baopu Li,Jiakang Yuan,Yaoxin Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Sequential Token Merging (STM)方法，通过双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护，显著提升Vision Mambas (ViMs)的效率，仅轻微影响精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViMs在图像分辨率增加时面临二次复杂度问题，现有方法忽略了其内在的Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD)机制。

Method: 提出STM方法，包括双向最近邻合并和隐藏状态保护，利用Mamba的选择性扫描逐步聚合信息。

Result: ViM-Ti在20% token减少时精度仅下降1.0%，ViM-S在40% token减少时精度下降1.4%，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: STM在保持精度的同时显著提升效率，为状态空间模型动态提供了新见解。

Abstract: Vision Mambas (ViMs) achieve remarkable success with sub-quadratic
complexity, but their efficiency remains constrained by quadratic token scaling
with image resolution. While existing methods address token redundancy, they
overlook ViMs' intrinsic Limited Directional Sequential Dependence (LDSD) - a
critical information flow mechanism revealed in our analysis. We further
identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in
hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging
(STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve
sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden
states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM
strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal
forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0%
accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for
ViM-S at 40% reduction. Our method achieves state-of-the-art efficiency with
minimal complexity, while providing new insights into state-space model
dynamics. Codes will be released soon.

### [7] [Deep Learning Empowered Super-Resolution: A Comprehensive Survey and Future Prospects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22692)
*Le Zhang,Ao Li,Qibin Hou,Ce Zhu,Yonina C. Eldar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文对超分辨率（SR）领域进行了全面综述，涵盖多种方法、数据集和评估协议，并提供了分类和开放问题的探讨。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有综述多局限于特定领域，缺乏对超分辨率领域的全面概述，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 综述了150多种单图像超分辨率（SISR）、70种视频超分辨率（VSR）以及30种立体和光场超分辨率方法，并分析了方法、数据集、评估协议和结果。

Result: 提供了详细的分类和复杂性分析，并探讨了未充分研究的开放问题。

Conclusion: 本文为研究者提供了宝贵的资源，并创建了专用仓库以方便访问相关工作。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) has garnered significant attention within the computer
vision community, driven by advances in deep learning (DL) techniques and the
growing demand for high-quality visual applications. With the expansion of this
field, numerous surveys have emerged. Most existing surveys focus on specific
domains, lacking a comprehensive overview of this field. Here, we present an
in-depth review of diverse SR methods, encompassing single image
super-resolution (SISR), video super-resolution (VSR), stereo super-resolution
(SSR), and light field super-resolution (LFSR). We extensively cover over 150
SISR methods, nearly 70 VSR approaches, and approximately 30 techniques for SSR
and LFSR. We analyze methodologies, datasets, evaluation protocols, empirical
results, and complexity. In addition, we conducted a taxonomy based on each
backbone structure according to the diverse purposes. We also explore valuable
yet under-studied open issues in the field. We believe that this work will
serve as a valuable resource and offer guidance to researchers in this domain.
To facilitate access to related work, we created a dedicated repository

### [8] [Learning Hyperspectral Images with Curated Text Prompts for Efficient Multimodal Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22697)
*Abhiroop Chatterjee,Susmita Ghosh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CLIP风格对比训练框架的视觉语言模型（VLM），用于高光谱图像（HSI）场景理解，仅更新0.07%参数即实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像的高维3D体素结构使其跨模态对齐成为未充分探索的开放问题，需要高效学习方法来优化模型。

Method: 通过对比损失和描述性提示，将视觉特征与冻结的大型嵌入模型（LEM）的文本表示对齐，仅训练少量参数。

Result: 在Indian Pines和Pavia University数据集上分别提升0.92 OA/1.60 Kappa和0.69 OA/0.90 Kappa，参数规模远小于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过高效参数更新和跨模态对齐，显著提升了高光谱场景理解的性能。

Abstract: As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly
depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than
brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI),
the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where
each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral
channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for
natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral
domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an
attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene
understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our
framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent
space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns
vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two
modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of
hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives,
along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts
that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for
the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07
percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For
example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal
and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa
($\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA
and +0.90 $\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters,
nearly 50$\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.

### [9] [Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking for One-Shot Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22700)
*Zhuang Qi,Pan Yu,Lei Meng,Sijin Zhou,Han Yu,Xiaoxiao Li,Xiangxu Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GPR-NIAM是一种用于一次性联邦提示学习的方法，通过注意力掩码和跨模态知识对齐提升跨任务泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有联邦提示学习方法依赖多轮通信和缺乏跨任务泛化的问题。

Method: 设计注意力隔离模块和跨模态协作细化模块，限制提示嵌入与原始文本嵌入的交互，并整合多源知识。

Result: 在十个基准数据集上优于八种先进方法，提升了类级和域级泛化能力。

Conclusion: GPR-NIAM通过创新的注意力掩码和知识对齐机制，显著提升了一次性联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by
tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL
methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the
second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models.
Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully
exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods
typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To
bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering
Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to
design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the
original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves
this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention
isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the
original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves
generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement
module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and
calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge
alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity.
Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show
that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level
and domain-level generalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于专家混合的广义零样本学习模型（GZSL-MoE），用于3D点云语义分割，在COVERED数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在缺乏所有类别训练数据时，3D点云语义分割中未见类别的识别问题。

Method: 结合生成零样本学习与专家混合层（MoE），生成与真实特征相似的假特征。

Result: GZSL-MoE模型在可见和未见类别上均表现出色。

Conclusion: GZSL-MoE为复杂3D环境理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative Zero-Shot Learning approach (GZSL) has demonstrated significant
potential in 3D point cloud semantic segmentation tasks. GZSL leverages
generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real
features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes
during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we
introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts
(GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to
generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a
pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main
contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the
Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning
model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset
(CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC)
environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with
Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides
a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when
comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The
performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance
performance on both seen and unseen classes. Keywords Generalized Zero-Shot

### [11] [IBiT: Utilizing Inductive Biases to Create a More Data Efficient Attention Mechanism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22719)
*Adithya Giri*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IBiT通过引入学习掩码的归纳偏置，使视觉Transformer在小数据集上表现更好，同时保持可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在计算机视觉中表现优异，但缺乏卷积神经网络的归纳偏置，导致小数据集上性能不足。

Method: 提出IBiT，通过学习掩码引入归纳偏置，无需知识蒸馏。

Result: IBiT在小数据集上显著更准确，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: IBiT结合了Transformer和卷积网络的优点，适用于小数据集。

Abstract: In recent years, Transformer-based architectures have become the dominant
method for Computer Vision applications. While Transformers are explainable and
scale well with dataset size, they lack the inductive biases of Convolutional
Neural Networks. While these biases may be learned on large datasets, we show
that introducing these inductive biases through learned masks allow Vision
Transformers to learn on much smaller datasets without Knowledge Distillation.
These Transformers, which we call Inductively Biased Image Transformers (IBiT),
are significantly more accurate on small datasets, while retaining the
explainability Transformers.

*Zezhong Fan,Xiaohan Li,Luyi Ma,Kai Zhao,Liang Peng,Topojoy Biswas,Evren Korpeoglu,Kaushiki Nag,Kannan Achan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayoutAgent结合视觉语言推理与组合扩散模型，生成更真实的多物体场景布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏空间推理能力，传统空间规划方法难以捕捉视觉场景的语义丰富性。

Method: 通过视觉语言模型预处理输入，利用组合扩散合成边界框，最后生成完整场景。

Result: 实验表明LayoutAgent在布局一致性、空间真实性和美学对齐上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LayoutAgent成功结合了语义推理与空间规划，提升了场景布局的真实性。

Abstract: Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images,
but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical
plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have
enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning,
leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial
planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency,
but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this
gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies
vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation.
Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first
employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation,
object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we
leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to
synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene
graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator
composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout
guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent
outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout
coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.

*Jie Cai,Kangning Yang,Lan Fu,Jiaming Ding,Jinlong Li,Huiming Sun,Daitao Xing,Jinglin Shen,Zibo Meng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CompareBench是一个评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）视觉比较推理能力的基准，包含1000个QA对，覆盖四个任务。评估显示当前模型在时间排序和空间关系等基础任务上存在明显不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉比较推理是VLMs的基本但未被充分研究的技能，需要系统评估以推动多模态推理的进步。

Method: 构建CompareBench基准，包含四个任务（数量、时间、几何、空间），并评估闭源和开源VLMs。

Result: 当前最强模型在时间排序和空间关系任务上表现不佳，甚至在基础计数和几何比较中犯错。

Conclusion: CompareBench为提升多模态推理可靠性提供了诊断性评估基础，揭示了当前VLMs的视觉比较盲点。

Abstract: We introduce CompareBench, a benchmark for evaluating visual comparison
reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), a fundamental yet understudied
skill. CompareBench consists of 1000 QA pairs across four tasks: quantity
(600), temporal (100), geometric (200), and spatial (100). It is derived from
two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images
with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We
evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source
models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but
also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail
at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in
basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These
findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for
current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation,
CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal
reasoning.

TL;DR: MILR是一种在统一潜在向量空间中联合推理图像和文本的测试时方法，通过策略梯度方法实现，显著提升了多模态推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于推理的图像生成方法局限于单模态或依赖高质量推理数据进行微调，MILR旨在解决这些限制。

Method: MILR在统一潜在空间中搜索离散图像和文本标记的向量表示，使用策略梯度方法，并由图像质量评估器指导。

Result: 在GenEval、T2I-CompBench和WISE基准测试中达到最优性能，知识密集型任务WISE上提升80%。

Conclusion: 统一潜在空间中的联合推理是MILR高性能的关键，其在时间和文化推理方面表现出非平凡能力。

Abstract: Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance
in various domains, including image generation. However, existing
reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a
single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for
fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method
that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space.
Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of
discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy
gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within
the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that
natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus
facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to
be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate
entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE,
achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on
knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over
the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the
unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our
qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural
reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超声图像中斑点噪声、结构重叠及全局-局部特征交互弱的问题，弥合全局上下文与局部细节的语义差距。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器结构，结合多方向注意力模块和收缩策略，整合先验知识与局部特征。

Result: 在TN3K和BUSI数据集上分别达到0.8487和0.6495的IoU分数，性能最优。

Conclusion: UESA-Net通过多方向空间信息和先验知识提升分割鲁棒性和准确性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health
burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion
detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping
structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks
struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We
aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between
global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images.
  Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional
shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range
dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding
block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth
directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy
integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder
but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical
cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling.
  Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) -
UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union
(IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively.
  Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial
information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast
and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to
existing methods on multiple benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，PartCo显著提升了当前GCD方法的性能，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: PartCo通过弥合语义标签与部分级视觉组成之间的差距，为GCD设定了新的基准。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel
categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from
known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and
global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues
that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper,
we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel
framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual
feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo
captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced
understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly
integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant
modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets
demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD
approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between
semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new
benchmarks for GCD. Project page: https://visual-ai.github.io/partco

TL;DR: DEFT是一种高效的微调框架，通过分解预训练权重矩阵的更新来平衡目标分布对齐和任务统一能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决预训练T2I模型在微调时难以平衡目标分布对齐、新概念学习和任务统一能力的挑战。

Method: 使用两个可训练矩阵分解权重矩阵的更新：一个投影到低秩子空间补集，另一个进行低秩更新。

Result: 在多个数据集上展示了最先进的性能，证明了高效微调的新特性。

Conclusion: DEFT框架在保持编辑能力的同时，实现了高效的参数适应和任务统一。

Abstract: Efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) models involves
adjusting the model to suit a particular task or dataset while minimizing
computational resources and limiting the number of trainable parameters.
However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning
with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for
personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying
multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of
prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT,
Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that
adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two
components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of
a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update.
The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other
trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that
subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench
Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene
adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation
framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a
unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is

TL;DR: VideoScore2是一个多维度、可解释且与人类对齐的视频评估框架，用于评估文本到视频生成的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法局限于单一分数或缺乏解释性，无法全面评估视频质量。

Method: 使用大规模数据集VideoFeedback2进行两阶段训练（监督微调+强化学习），采用GRPO增强分析鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，准确率提升显著，并提供可解释的评估结果。

Conclusion: VideoScore2通过多维度评估和可解释性，填补了视频质量评估与可控生成之间的差距。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video generation have produced increasingly
realistic and diverse content, yet evaluating such videos remains a fundamental
challenge due to their multi-faceted nature encompassing visual quality,
semantic alignment, and physical consistency. Existing evaluators and reward
models are limited to single opaque scores, lack interpretability, or provide
only coarse analysis, making them insufficient for capturing the comprehensive
nature of video quality assessment. We present VideoScore2, a
multi-dimensional, interpretable, and human-aligned framework that explicitly
evaluates visual quality, text-to-video alignment, and physical/common-sense
consistency while producing detailed chain-of-thought rationales. Our model is
trained on a large-scale dataset VideoFeedback2 containing 27,168
human-annotated videos with both scores and reasoning traces across three
dimensions, using a two-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning followed by
reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to
enhance analytical robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
VideoScore2 achieves superior performance with 44.35 (+5.94) accuracy on our
in-domain benchmark VideoScore-Bench-v2 and 50.37 (+4.32) average performance
across four out-of-domain benchmarks (VideoGenReward-Bench, VideoPhy2, etc),
while providing interpretable assessments that bridge the gap between
evaluation and controllable generation through effective reward modeling for
Best-of-N sampling. Project Page: https://tiger-ai-lab.github.io/VideoScore2/

TL;DR: TRUST是一种新的测试时适应方法，利用SSM的独特架构特性提升模型在分布变化下的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SSM在分布变化下泛化性能显著下降的问题。

Method: 通过不确定性引导的SSM遍历生成多个因果视角，利用伪标签更新参数并整合学习信息。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，TRUST显著提升了鲁棒性并优于现有TTA方法。

Conclusion: TRUST是首个利用SSM架构特性进行适应的TTA方法，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with VMamba standing out as a pioneering architecture
designed for vision tasks. However, their generalization performance degrades
significantly under distribution shifts. To address this limitation, we propose
TRUST (Test-Time Refinement using Uncertainty-Guided SSM Traverses), a novel
test-time adaptation (TTA) method that leverages diverse traversal permutations
to generate multiple causal perspectives of the input image. Model predictions
serve as pseudo-labels to guide updates of the Mamba-specific parameters, and
the adapted weights are averaged to integrate the learned information across
traversal scans. Altogether, TRUST is the first approach that explicitly
leverages the unique architectural properties of SSMs for adaptation.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that TRUST consistently improves
robustness and outperforms existing TTA methods.

TL;DR: MMPB是首个评估视觉语言模型（VLM）个性化能力的基准测试，包含10k图像-查询对和111个个性化概念。研究发现大多数VLM在个性化任务中表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉个性化在用户导向的AI系统中至关重要，但现有VLM的个性化能力尚未充分探索。

Method: MMPB基准测试分为三个阶段：概念注入、多轮对话和个性化查询，评估了23种VLM。

Result: 大多数VLM在个性化任务中表现不佳，尤其是在对话一致性、用户偏好处理和视觉线索适应方面。

Conclusion: MMPB揭示了VLM在个性化任务中的局限性，为未来研究提供了基准和方向。

Abstract: Visual personalization is essential in user-facing AI systems such as smart
homes and healthcare, where aligning model behavior with user-centric concepts
is critical. However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their
broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to
individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive
benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k
image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four
categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category
enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into
three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs.
Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we
evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept
injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings
indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with
personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue,
handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals
that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and
long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By
identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers
valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly
personalized multi-modal AI. Project Page: aidaslab.github.io/MMPB

Motivation: 现有对抗性补丁攻击方法存在不切实际的白盒假设、非目标性攻击或视觉显眼等问题，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合生成式U-Net设计和Grad-CAM引导的补丁放置，实现语义感知定位，最大化攻击效果并保持视觉真实性。

Result: 在多种网络（如DenseNet-121、ResNet-50、ViT-B/16等）上，攻击成功率和目标类成功率均超过99%。

Conclusion: 该框架在真实性、目标控制和黑盒适用性方面均优于现有方法，为对抗性鲁棒性研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Adversarial patch attacks pose a severe threat to deep neural networks, yet
most existing approaches rely on unrealistic white-box assumptions, untargeted
objectives, or produce visually conspicuous patches that limit real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for fully
controllable adversarial patch generation, where the attacker can freely choose
both the input image x and the target class y target, thereby dictating the
exact misclassification outcome. Our method combines a generative U-Net design
with Grad-CAM-guided patch placement, enabling semantic-aware localization that
maximizes attack effectiveness while preserving visual realism. Extensive
experiments across convolutional networks (DenseNet-121, ResNet-50) and vision
transformers (ViT-B/16, Swin-B/16, among others) demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance across all settings, with attack success
rates (ASR) and target-class success (TCS) consistently exceeding 99%.
  Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box
attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic
approaches that produce detectable artifacts. By simultaneously ensuring
realism, targeted control, and black-box applicability-the three most
challenging dimensions of patch-based attacks-our framework establishes a new
benchmark for adversarial robustness research, bridging the gap between
theoretical attack strength and practical stealthiness.

Motivation: 提升时间序列预测的模型透明度和决策支持能力，解决传统方法在时间显著性检测上的计算复杂性和性能不足问题。

Method: 采用基于补丁的跨注意力机制和多尺度处理，嵌入注意力机制以提供内在的时间显著性解释。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的鲁棒性，显著优于大多数基于Transformer的模型，同时保持预测准确性。

Conclusion: CrossScaleNet在时间显著性检测和预测性能上均表现出色，填补了现有模型在可解释性和性能之间的差距。

Abstract: Explainability in time series forecasting is essential for improving model
transparency and supporting informed decision-making. In this work, we present
CrossScaleNet, an innovative architecture that combines a patch-based
cross-attention mechanism with multi-scale processing to achieve both high
performance and enhanced temporal explainability. By embedding attention
mechanisms into the training process, our model provides intrinsic
explainability for temporal saliency, making its decision-making process more
transparent. Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are
computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance
detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer
features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its
complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency
ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness
of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world
datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms
most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without
sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior
performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy.
Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail
to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks. CrossScaleNet addresses
this gap, offering a balanced approach that captures temporal saliency
effectively while delivering state-of-the-art forecasting performance across
datasets of varying complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌放疗中IGTV的精确分割受限于标注数据不足和PET信号衰减，需要更可靠的分割方法。

Method: 使用预训练的MAMBA网络，结合SIM模块在2.5D框架中建模切片间关系，提升分割性能。

Result: 在私有IGTV数据集上Dice分数达到0.609，显著优于基线0.385。

Conclusion: 迁移学习与SIM模块的结合为肺癌放疗计划提供了更可靠的IGTV分割方案。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancerrelated deaths globally.
Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is
pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to
account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of
annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor
boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology
utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained
on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a
private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the
Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the
challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a
slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to
effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates
channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling
more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving
overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation
demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV
dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385.
This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced
multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical
relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.

Motivation: 事件相机数据标注成本高且困难，需要大规模标注数据。

Method: 利用扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的先验知识，通过控制信号（如文本标签、2D骨架、3D姿态）生成事件数据。

Result: 合成数据提升了视觉识别、2D骨架估计和3D姿态估计任务的性能，并能生成未见过的文本标签数据。

Conclusion: ControlEvents高效降低了标注成本，并展示了强大的文本生成能力。

Abstract: In recent years, event cameras have gained significant attention due to their
bio-inspired properties, such as high temporal resolution and high dynamic
range. However, obtaining large-scale labeled ground-truth data for event-based
vision tasks remains challenging and costly. In this paper, we present
ControlEvents, a diffusion-based generative model designed to synthesize
high-quality event data guided by diverse control signals such as class text
labels, 2D skeletons, and 3D body poses. Our key insight is to leverage the
diffusion prior from foundation models, such as Stable Diffusion, enabling
high-quality event data generation with minimal fine-tuning and limited labeled
data. Our method streamlines the data generation process and significantly
reduces the cost of producing labeled event datasets. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual
recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation. Our
experiments show that the synthesized labeled event data enhances model
performance in all tasks. Additionally, our approach can generate events based
on unseen text labels during training, illustrating the powerful text-based
generation capabilities inherited from foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习型方法在医学图像配准中速度快但需要大量数据且精度不足，而隐式神经表示(INRs)虽灵活但计算效率低且稳定性差。

Method: 提出KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR，结合KANs与INRs，并引入随机基采样策略以减少基函数数量。

Result: 在多种数据集上，KAN-IDIR和RandKAN-IDIR在INR方法中表现最佳，计算成本低且稳定性高。

Conclusion: RandKAN-IDIR在随机基采样下性能更优，同时避免了额外的训练复杂度。

Abstract: Deformable image registration (DIR) is a cornerstone of medical image
analysis, enabling spatial alignment for tasks like comparative studies and
multi-modal fusion. While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers)
offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle
to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types
and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as
a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings
from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of
requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and
seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this
work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with
implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling
strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while
maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational
costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI,
cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based
approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration
approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among
INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal
computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random
seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized
basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function
indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有集合输入网络（如Deep Sets和Set Transformer）只能处理向量输入，无法直接处理3D图像张量，需额外特征提取器。

Method: CST直接操作3D图像张量，同时进行特征提取和上下文建模，支持CNN可解释性方法（如Grad-CAM）。

Result: CST在集合分类和异常检测任务中表现优异，且支持预训练和迁移学习。

Conclusion: CST为图像集处理提供了高效且可解释的解决方案，并开源了预训练模型CST-15。

Abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Set Transformer (CST), a novel neural
architecture designed to process image sets of arbitrary cardinality that are
visually heterogeneous yet share high-level semantics - such as a common
category, scene, or concept. Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and
Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D
image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor,
typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input
network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly
on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling
simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This
design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set
Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN
explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that
remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale
datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard
Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a
CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet
(https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).

Conclusion: TY-RIST在红外小目标检测中实现了高性能和实时性，并展示了强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Infrared small target detection (IRSTD) is critical for defense and
surveillance but remains challenging due to (1) target loss from minimal
features, (2) false alarms in cluttered environments, (3) missed detections
from low saliency, and (4) high computational costs. To address these issues,
we propose TY-RIST, an optimized YOLOv12n architecture that integrates (1) a
stride-aware backbone with fine-grained receptive fields, (2) a high-resolution
detection head, (3) cascaded coordinate attention blocks, and (4) a branch
pruning strategy that reduces computational cost by about 25.5% while
marginally improving accuracy and enabling real-time inference. We also
incorporate the Normalized Gaussian Wasserstein Distance (NWD) to enhance
regression stability. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks and across 20
different models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, improving mAP at 0.5
IoU by +7.9%, Precision by +3%, and Recall by +10.2%, while achieving up to 123
FPS on a single GPU. Cross-dataset validation on a fifth dataset further
confirms strong generalization capability. Additional results and resources are

Motivation: 3D高斯溅射的参数化表示在神经网络中难以学习，直接使用原始高斯参数会导致模型高度依赖数据。

Method: 提出了一种基于连续子流形场的嵌入表示方法，封装高斯基元的固有信息。

Result: 该方法保留了颜色和几何结构，同时实现了唯一映射和通道同质性。

Conclusion: 提出的嵌入表示方法有助于3D高斯溅射的学习。

Abstract: A well-designed vectorized representation is crucial for the learning systems
natively based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. While 3DGS enables efficient and
explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to
learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding
raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the
non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding
highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more
principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that
preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique
mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding
representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate
the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the
learning of 3DGS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 一步生成器存在建模偏差和离散输出阻碍梯度流动的问题，限制了后续优化。

Method: 引入软嵌入技术，将离散标记替换为生成器输出分布的期望嵌入，保持表示保真度的同时提供可微的连续替代。

Result: 在多个MDM教师模型上，Soft-Di[M]O实现了最佳的一步生成性能，包括图像和文本生成任务。

Conclusion: 软嵌入技术显著提升了一步生成器的性能，并支持多种后续优化方法。

Abstract: One-step generators distilled from Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) compress
multiple sampling steps into a single forward pass, enabling efficient text and
image synthesis. However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit
modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient
flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training,
reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this
work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete
tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution.
Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete
generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is
compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft
embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes
one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward
application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and
TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen),
Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image
performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement,
along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward
fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.

deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a
hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data
foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0
model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model
DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are
input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical
diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal
feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a
Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust
few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0
achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent
at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a
substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training
samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and
species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58
percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI
2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and
provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and
conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.

Motivation: 脑肿瘤的及时检测对改善患者预后至关重要，但缺乏可靠的MRI资源。

Method: 使用预训练的ResNet50进行特征提取，结合GAP和线性投影，引入Dense-Dropout序列增强非线性特征学习。

Result: 创建了MMCBT数据集（209名受试者，3671张肿瘤和13273张非肿瘤图像），并通过数据增强解决了类别不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 提出的框架和数据集为脑肿瘤检测提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Brain tumors are abnormal cell growths in the central nervous system (CNS),
and their timely detection is critical for improving patient outcomes. This
paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain
tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework
employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global
Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image
representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout
sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature
learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature
transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh
Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of
reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209
subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all
clinically verified under expert supervision. To overcome class imbalance, the
tumor class was augmented, resulting in a balanced dataset well-suited for deep
learning research.

Conclusion: Hemorica为ICH诊断AI系统提供了高质量基准数据集。

Abstract: Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT)
scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial
Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To
close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372
head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been
exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH),
subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding
patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding
boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A
double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by
neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability.
Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the
dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and
transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and
hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such
as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas
a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary
lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the
sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified,
fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning,
facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the
process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification
systems.

Conclusion: ARSS展示了自回归模型在新视角生成任务中的潜力，优于传统扩散模型。

Abstract: Despite their exceptional generative quality, diffusion models have limited
applicability to world modeling tasks, such as novel view generation from
sparse inputs. This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs
in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across
views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to
new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal
fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In
this work, we introduce \textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a
GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image,
conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to
map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera
encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to
enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we
propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial
order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method
performs comparably to, or better than, state-of-the-art view synthesis
approaches based on diffusion models. Our code will be released upon paper
acceptance.

Conclusion: 分离动态和静态信息的方法能有效减少静态偏差，场景预测损失是关键。

Abstract: Action recognition models rely excessively on static cues rather than dynamic
human motion, which is known as static bias. This bias leads to poor
performance in real-world applications and zero-shot action recognition. In
this paper, we propose a method to reduce static bias by separating temporal
dynamic information from static scene information. Our approach uses a
statistical independence loss between biased and unbiased streams, combined
with a scene prediction loss. Our experiments demonstrate that this method
effectively reduces static bias and confirm the importance of scene prediction
loss.

Conclusion: DesenAT通过特征脱敏和自蒸馏，成功缓解了DNN对点云特征的过度依赖，提升了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision,
point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the
root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists
in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these
features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This
study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the
sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found
that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values
for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing
the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model
performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training'
(DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and
conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to
alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing
sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are
eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes,
generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model.
Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the
self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to
adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation
manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show
that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model
without reducing the performance of clean data sets. This code is publicly

Result: 性能差距缩小56.51%，骨骼长度和运动方差差异分别减少18.76%和5.48%。

Conclusion: 该方法在解剖学真实性和动作自然性方面取得了显著提升。

Abstract: Sign language translation from text to video plays a crucial role in enabling
effective communication for Deaf and hard--of--hearing individuals. A major
challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that
faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical
constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in
rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal
joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric
constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During
training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance
finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses
and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our
method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the
ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length
and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating
significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.

Result: 实验表明，Uni-Plan在长期规划任务中比基于VLM的方法显著提高了成功率，且无需专家演示，数据扩展性强。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来基于UMMs的推理和决策研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: With the powerful reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs), many recent works have explored using them for
decision-making. However, most of these approaches rely solely on
language-based reasoning, which limits their ability to reason and make
informed decisions. Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with
unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and
outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by
enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose
Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single
model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function.
In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a
novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves
as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments
on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves
success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data
scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better
performance under the same training-data size. This work lays a foundation for
future research in reasoning and decision-making with UMMs.

Result: DPM能可靠检测侵权内容，无需原始训练数据或文本提示，提供可解释的解决方案。

Conclusion: DPM为生成式AI时代的知识产权保护提供了实用且可解释的方法。

Abstract: The widespread deployment of large vision models such as Stable Diffusion
raises significant legal and ethical concerns, as these models can memorize and
reproduce copyrighted content without authorization. Existing detection
approaches often lack robustness and fail to provide rigorous theoretical
underpinnings. To address these gaps, we formalize the concept of copyright
infringement and its detection from the perspective of Differential Privacy
(DP), and introduce the conditional sensitivity metric, a concept analogous to
sensitivity in DP, that quantifies the deviation in a diffusion model's output
caused by the inclusion or exclusion of a specific training data point. To
operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc
detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image
diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes
by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning.
Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter
shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal
prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate
standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement
Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection
across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects
infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset
or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for
safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.

Result: 优化后的感知损失设计在噪声抑制和结构保真度上显著优于文献常用配置，且无需改动网络架构。

Conclusion: 论文为LDCT去噪中感知损失的有效使用提供了客观指导，并通过统计分析支持其结论。

Abstract: Perceptual losses have emerged as powerful tools for training networks to
enhance Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) images, offering an alternative to
traditional pixel-wise losses such as Mean Squared Error, which often lead to
over-smoothed reconstructions and loss of clinically relevant details in LDCT
images. The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a
pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level
features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses
involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature
representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the
relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization.
In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that
quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total
loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss
design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic
experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature
to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed
alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to
significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of
reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network
architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical
analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

Result: 在Sen1Floods11数据集上，模型在最优传感器融合场景下F1分数0.896，优于基线模型Prithvi-100M。

Conclusion: 该方法参数高效、传感器灵活，为实际灾害场景提供了快速洪水范围评估的解决方案。

Abstract: Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human
and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate
flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood
monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor
approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit
periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational
resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this
study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by
fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal
pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and
multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood
mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single
model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response
with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We
evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale
Prithvi-100M baseline ($\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data
availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with
an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario,
outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated
robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1:
0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1:
0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational
flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an
accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring
immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability
constraints.

TL;DR: GeLoc3r通过几何一致性正则化（GCR）提升相机姿态回归方法的精度，结合回归速度和几何理解，显著优于ReLoc3R。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ReLoc3R在内部表示中的几何不一致问题，同时保持快速推理速度。

Method: 利用训练时的地面真实深度生成密集3D-2D对应关系，通过FusionTransformer学习对应关系重要性，并使用加权RANSAC计算几何一致的姿态。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著提升性能，如CO3Dv2上AUC@5°提升16%。

Conclusion: GeLoc3r通过训练时学习几何一致性，实现了回归速度和几何精度的双重优势。

Abstract: Prior ReLoc3R achieves breakthrough performance with fast 25ms inference and
state-of-the-art regression accuracy, yet our analysis reveals subtle geometric
inconsistencies in its internal representations that prevent reaching the
precision ceiling of correspondence-based methods like MASt3R (which require
300ms per pair). In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative
camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric
Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma
by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses
without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r
leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights
them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and
computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a
consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression
network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving
at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time,
maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On
challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving
significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\deg} on the CO3Dv2
dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\deg} on
RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric
consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r
represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry,
achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of
correspondence methods.

Abstract: Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite
the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that
reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key
component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR)
technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have
primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for
recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely
concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning
rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the
actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of
Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors
and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly
collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess
and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We
analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke
patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals.
Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for
each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study
suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has
learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action
recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary
rehabilitation in future research. The code presented in this study is
available at https://github.com/ye-Kim/MMeViT.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了实用且忠实的最小化解释，有助于理解模型决策。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce an activation-matching--based approach to generate
minimal, faithful explanations for the decision-making of a pretrained
classifier on any given image. Given an input image \(x\) and a frozen model
\(f\), we train a lightweight autoencoder to output a binary mask \(m\) such
that the explanation \(e = m \odot x\) preserves both the model's prediction
and the intermediate activations of \(x\). Our objective combines: (i)
multi-layer activation matching with KL divergence to align distributions and
cross-entropy to retain the top-1 label for both the image and the explanation;
(ii) mask priors -- L1 area for minimality, a binarization penalty for crisp
0/1 masks, and total variation for compactness; and (iii) abductive constraints
for faithfulness and necessity. Together, these objectives yield small,
human-interpretable masks that retain classifier behavior while discarding
irrelevant input regions, providing practical and faithful minimalist
explanations for the decision making of the underlying model.

Conclusion: 可控的文本驱动掩码能实现语义对齐的自监督学习，为医学图像分析提供更鲁棒的视觉模型。

Abstract: The scarcity of annotated data in specialized domains such as medical imaging
presents significant challenges to training robust vision models. While
self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution,
existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to
inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants
typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting
their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a
controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image
analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region
localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize
diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas.
This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved
representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability.
Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including
brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently
outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1
percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision
(BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it
achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios
(e.g., 40\% vs. 70\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven
masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the
development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FMC-DETR是一种新型的航空视角目标检测框架，通过频率解耦融合解决了现有方法在全局上下文建模和非线性建模上的不足，显著提升了小目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空视角目标检测在自然资源监测、交通管理等应用中至关重要，但现有方法因上下文融合延迟和非线性建模不足而性能受限。

Method: 提出WeKat骨干网络增强全局低频上下文感知，CPF模块优化多尺度特征交互，MDFC模块统一空间、频率和结构先验。

Result: 在VisDrone数据集上，AP和AP50分别提升6.5%和8.2%，参数更少。

Conclusion: FMC-DETR在航空视角小目标检测中表现优异，代码已开源。

Abstract: Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world
applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and
UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial
imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and
the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods
are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear
modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow
features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these
challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled
fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet
Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet
transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow
features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold
networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies.
Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy
and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the
Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial,
frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global
enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets
demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer
parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves
improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its
effectiveness in tiny object detection. The code can be accessed at

Method: 利用直接偏好优化方法进行对齐训练，并使用公共奖励模型构建偏好数据集。

Result: 实验表明奖励模型能有效构建偏好数据，偏好数据在不同模型和基准测试中表现稳健，简单集成方法能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的对齐模型在标准指标、GPT-4评估和人类评估中显著优于先前模型，为图像修复偏好对齐提供了简单而强大的基线。

Abstract: This paper investigates image inpainting with preference alignment. Instead
of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental
problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct
preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public
reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are
conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models
with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as
follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing
preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2)
Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample
scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models,
particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them
susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models
yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon
these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models
across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any
changes to model structures or the use of new datasets. We hope our work can
set a simple yet solid baseline, pushing this promising frontier. Our code is

TL;DR: XMAG是一种轻量级基础模型，通过跨放大倍数蒸馏技术，将20x放大倍数的教师模型知识转移到5x放大倍数的学生模型中，显著降低了计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础模型在临床部署中因高计算需求和参数数量庞大而受限的问题。

Method: 采用跨放大倍数蒸馏框架，结合全局图像表示和局部空间标记映射的双层知识转移，使用紧凑的5x放大倍数架构。

Result: 在六种临床相关任务中，XMAG的诊断准确性与大型基础模型相差不到1%，同时处理速度提高了30倍。

Conclusion: 跨放大倍数蒸馏是资源受限临床环境中部署基础模型的有效方法，有望实现实时病理AI集成。

Abstract: Foundation models (FM) have transformed computational pathology but remain
computationally prohibitive for clinical deployment due to their massive
parameter counts and high-magnification processing requirements. Here, we
introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification
distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification
teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a
compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer
patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel
distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning
both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained
XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and
evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis
tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within
1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold
processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our
cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we
developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's
performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish
cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM
capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially
enabling real-time pathology AI integration.

*Na Min An,Inha Kang,Minhyun Lee,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPatch是一个零样本RIS框架，通过增强文本和图像的空间表示，显著提升了空间定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在空间关系理解上表现不佳，CoPatch旨在利用模型内部组件提升空间表征。

Method: 通过结合上下文标记构建混合文本特征，并从中间层提取图像块特征，生成聚类图像-文本相似性图（CoMap）。

Result: 在多个数据集上（RefCOCO等）零样本RIS任务中mIoU提升2-7点。

Conclusion: CoPatch展示了利用VLM中潜在空间知识的重要性，为零样本RIS提供了新思路。

Abstract: Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where
the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current
foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning
images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within
the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun
phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens.
Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with
different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial
structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a
zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance
spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language,
\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context
tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image
features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where
spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a
clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask
selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial
grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+
2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore
the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge
inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in
zero-shot RIS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降低乘法运算成本对高效部署深度神经网络至关重要，尤其是在能源受限的边缘设备上。

Method: HTMA-Net选择性地用基于Hadamard的混合变换层替换中间卷积层，通过免乘法内存操作实现内部卷积。

Result: 在ResNet-18等模型上，HTMA-Net减少了52%的乘法运算，同时保持准确性并降低计算复杂性和参数数量。

Conclusion: 结合Hadamard变换和免乘法内存计算是实现高效深度学习架构的有前景的方法。

Abstract: Reducing the cost of multiplications is critical for efficient deep neural
network deployment, especially in energy-constrained edge devices. In this
work, we introduce HTMA-Net, a novel framework that integrates the Hadamard
Transform (HT) with multiplication-avoiding (MA) SRAM-based in-memory computing
to reduce arithmetic complexity while maintaining accuracy. Unlike prior
methods that only target multiplications in convolutional layers or focus
solely on in-memory acceleration, HTMA-Net selectively replaces intermediate
convolutions with Hybrid Hadamard-based transform layers whose internal
convolutions are implemented via multiplication-avoiding in-memory operations.
We evaluate HTMA-Net on ResNet-18 using CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet,
and provide a detailed comparison against regular, MF-only, and HT-only
variants. Results show that HTMA-Net eliminates up to 52\% of multiplications
compared to baseline ResNet-18, ResNet-20, and ResNet-50 models, while
achieving comparable accuracy in evaluation and significantly reducing
computational complexity and the number of parameters. Our results demonstrate
that combining structured Hadamard transform layers with SRAM-based in-memory
computing multiplication-avoiding operators is a promising path towards
efficient deep learning architectures.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集在遥感变化理解任务中缺乏深度理解和多任务交互，需要更全面的数据集和方法。

Method: 构建了ChangeIMTI数据集，设计了双粒度感知的ChangeVG模型，结合空间特征提取和语义总结。

Result: 在变化描述任务上，方法比最强基线Semantic-CC提升了1.39分（S*m指标）。

Conclusion: ChangeVG模型通过多任务学习和视觉引导模块，显著提升了遥感变化理解的性能。

Abstract: Remote sensing change understanding (RSCU) is essential for analyzing remote
sensing images and understanding how human activities affect the environment.
However, existing datasets lack deep understanding and interactions in the
diverse change captioning, counting, and localization tasks. To tackle these
gaps, we construct ChangeIMTI, a new large-scale interactive multi-task
instruction dataset that encompasses four complementary tasks including change
captioning, binary change classification, change counting, and change
localization. Building upon this new dataset, we further design a novel
vision-guided vision-language model (ChangeVG) with dual-granularity awareness
for bi-temporal remote sensing images (i.e., two remote sensing images of the
same area at different times). The introduced vision-guided module is a
dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial
feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched
representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large
vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning,
thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively
conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our
approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the
strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric,
which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an
overall evaluation of change caption. Moreover, we also perform a series of
ablation studies to examine the critical components of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在计算与保真度之间存在权衡问题，VAE模型存在信息丢失和细节不足，而像素空间模型计算成本高。

Method: 采用条件依赖耦合策略，将生成过程分解为多阶段的插值轨迹，并通过统一的扩散Transformer实现端到端优化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个分辨率下实现了高保真度和高效率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了计算与保真度的权衡问题，支持端到端优化和知识共享。

Abstract: Existing image generation models face critical challenges regarding the
trade-off between computation and fidelity. Specifically, models relying on a
pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) suffer from information loss, limited
detail, and the inability to support end-to-end training. In contrast, models
operating directly in the pixel space incur prohibitive computational cost.
Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation
prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and
often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage. To address
these challenges, we introduce a unified multistage generative framework based
on our proposed Conditional Dependent Coupling strategy. It decomposes the
generative process into interpolant trajectories at multiple stages, ensuring
accurate distribution learning while enabling end-to-end optimization.
Importantly, the entire process is modeled as a single unified Diffusion
Transformer, eliminating the need for disjoint modules and also enabling
knowledge sharing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves
both high fidelity and efficiency across multiple resolutions.

Abstract: Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) is essential for rapid stroke
diagnosis but is limited by low image contrast and signal to noise ratio. We
address this challenge by leveraging DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised
vision transformer, to generate powerful feature representations for a
comprehensive set of stroke analysis tasks. Our evaluation encompasses infarct
and hemorrhage segmentation, anomaly classification (normal vs. stroke and
normal vs. infarct vs. hemorrhage), hemorrhage subtype classification (EDH,
SDH, SAH, IPH, IVH), and dichotomized ASPECTS classification (<=6 vs. >6) on
multiple public and private datasets. This study establishes strong benchmarks
for these tasks and demonstrates the potential of advanced self-supervised
models to improve automated stroke diagnosis from NCCT, providing a clear

Result: 实验表明Earth-Agent在多种任务中表现优异，优于通用代理框架和MLLMs。

Conclusion: Earth-Agent为地球观测分析提供了新范式，推动了LLMs在科学领域的应用。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) is essential for understanding the evolving states of
the Earth system. Although recent MLLMs have advanced EO research, they still
lack the capability to tackle complex tasks that require multi-step reasoning
and the use of domain-specific tools. Agent-based methods offer a promising
direction, but current attempts remain in their infancy, confined to RGB
perception, shallow reasoning, and lacking systematic evaluation protocols. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic
framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool
ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal
reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific
tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal
analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To
support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark
of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and
RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that
assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct
comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with
general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing
benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.
Earth-Agent establishes a new paradigm for EO analysis, moving the field toward
scientifically grounded, next-generation applications of LLMs in Earth
observation. Our code and dataset will be publicly released.

Result: 在多个多天气数据集上达到无监督方法中的最优性能，对复杂天气降解有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: WeatherCycle通过统一框架和降解感知策略，有效解决了多天气图像恢复的挑战。

Abstract: Unsupervised image restoration under multi-weather conditions remains a
fundamental yet underexplored challenge. While existing methods often rely on
task-specific physical priors, their narrow focus limits scalability and
generalization to diverse real-world weather scenarios. In this work, we
propose \textbf{WeatherCycle}, a unified unpaired framework that reformulates
weather restoration as a bidirectional degradation-content translation cycle,
guided by degradation-aware curriculum regularization. At its core,
WeatherCycle employs a \textit{lumina-chroma decomposition} strategy to
decouple degradation from content without modeling complex weather, enabling
domain conversion between degraded and clean images. To model diverse and
complex degradations, we propose a \textit{Lumina Degradation Guidance Module}
(LDGM), which learns luminance degradation priors from a degraded image pool
and injects them into clean images via frequency-domain amplitude modulation,
enabling controllable and realistic degradation modeling. Additionally, we
incorporate a \textit{Difficulty-Aware Contrastive Regularization (DACR)}
module that identifies hard samples via a CLIP-based classifier and enforces
contrastive alignment between hard samples and restored features to enhance
semantic consistency and robustness. Extensive experiments across serve
multi-weather datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance among unsupervised approaches, with strong generalization to
complex weather degradations.

Conclusion: Sparse2Dense有望推动高效带宽的人体中心媒体传输应用。

Abstract: For bandwidth-constrained multimedia applications, simultaneously achieving
ultra-low bitrate human video compression and accurate vertex prediction
remains a critical challenge, as it demands the harmonization of dynamic motion
modeling, detailed appearance synthesis, and geometric consistency. To address
this challenge, we propose Sparse2Dense, a keypoint-driven generative framework
that leverages extremely sparse 3D keypoints as compact transmitted symbols to
enable ultra-low bitrate human video compression and precise human vertex
prediction. The key innovation is the multi-task learning-based and
keypoint-aware deep generative model, which could encode complex human motion
via compact 3D keypoints and leverage these sparse keypoints to estimate dense
motion for video synthesis with temporal coherence and realistic textures.
Additionally, a vertex predictor is integrated to learn human vertex geometry
through joint optimization with video generation, ensuring alignment between
visual content and geometric structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
the proposed Sparse2Dense framework achieves competitive compression
performance for human video over traditional/generative video codecs, whilst
enabling precise human vertex prediction for downstream geometry applications.
As such, Sparse2Dense is expected to facilitate bandwidth-efficient
human-centric media transmission, such as real-time motion analysis, virtual
human animation, and immersive entertainment.

Abstract: Accurate counting of vehicle axles is essential for traffic control, toll
collection, and infrastructure development. We present an end-to-end,
video-based pipeline for axle counting that tackles limitations of previous
works in dense environments. Our system leverages a combination of YOLO-OBB to
detect and categorize vehicles, and YOLO to detect tires. Detected tires are
intelligently associated to their respective parent vehicles, enabling accurate
axle prediction even in complex scenarios. However, there are a few challenges
in detection when it comes to scenarios with longer and occluded vehicles. We
mitigate vehicular occlusions and partial detections for longer vehicles by
proposing a novel TRAX (Tire and Axle Tracking) Algorithm to successfully track
axle-related features between frames. Our method stands out by significantly
reducing false positives and improving the accuracy of axle-counting for long
vehicles, demonstrating strong robustness in real-world traffic videos. This
work represents a significant step toward scalable, AI-driven axle counting
systems, paving the way for machine vision to replace legacy roadside
infrastructure.

TL;DR: CalSAM通过轻量级适应框架改进SAM在医学图像中的表现，减少域偏移和过度自信问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在自然图像中表现优秀，但在医学图像中存在域偏移和过度自信问题。

Method: 提出CalSAM框架，结合特征Fisher信息惩罚（FIP）和置信度错位惩罚（CMP），仅微调解码器。

Result: 在跨中心和扫描仪偏移评估中，CalSAM显著提升了准确性和校准性。

Conclusion: CalSAM在脑MRI分割中实现了更好的域泛化和校准不确定性估计，同时保留了SAM编码器的计算优势。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits strong zero-shot performance on
natural images but suffers from domain shift and overconfidence when applied to
medical volumes. We propose \textbf{CalSAM}, a lightweight adaptation framework
that (i) reduces encoder sensitivity to domain shift via a \emph{Feature Fisher
Information Penalty} (FIP) computed on 3D feature maps and (ii) penalizes
overconfident voxel-wise errors through a \emph{Confidence Misalignment
Penalty} (CMP). The combined loss, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{CalSAM}}\) fine-tunes
only the mask decoder while keeping SAM's encoders frozen. On cross-center and
scanner-shift evaluations, CalSAM substantially improves accuracy and
calibration: e.g., on the BraTS scanner split (Siemens$\to$GE) CalSAM shows a
$+7.4\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$ (80.1\% vs.\ 74.6\%), a
$-26.9\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{HD95}$ (4.6 mm vs.\ 6.3 mm), and a $-39.5\%$
reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.2\% vs.\ 8.6\%). On ATLAS-C (motion
corruptions), CalSAM achieves a $+5.3\%$ relative improvement in $\mathrm{DSC}$
(75.9\%) and a $-32.6\%$ reduction in $\mathrm{ECE}$ (5.8\%). Ablations show
FIP and CMP contribute complementary gains ($p<0.01$), and the Fisher penalty
incurs a modest $\sim$15\% training-time overhead. CalSAM therefore delivers
improved domain generalization and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
brain MRI segmentation, while retaining the computational benefits of freezing
SAM's encoder.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如UNIT在无监督在线3D实例分割中存在训练多样性不足、时间采样僵化和对噪声伪标签依赖性强的问题。

Method: 通过合成点云序列生成增强训练分布，采用灵活采样策略捕捉长短期时间动态，并使用动态加权损失优化网络表示。

Conclusion: 提出的框架显著提升了无监督在线3D实例分割的性能，代码将开源。

Abstract: Unsupervised online 3D instance segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging
task, as it requires maintaining consistent object identities across LiDAR
scans without relying on annotated training data. Existing methods, such as
UNIT, have made progress in this direction but remain constrained by limited
training diversity, rigid temporal sampling, and heavy dependence on noisy
pseudo-labels. We propose a new framework that enriches the training
distribution through synthetic point cloud sequence generation, enabling
greater diversity without relying on manual labels or simulation engines. To
better capture temporal dynamics, our method incorporates a flexible sampling
strategy that leverages both adjacent and non-adjacent frames, allowing the
model to learn from long-range dependencies as well as short-term variations.
In addition, a dynamic-weighting loss emphasizes confident and informative
samples, guiding the network toward more robust representations. Through
extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and PandaSet, our method
consistently outperforms UNIT and other unsupervised baselines, achieving
higher segmentation accuracy and more robust temporal associations. The code
will be publicly available at github.com/Eaphan/SFT3D.

TL;DR: GaP是一种新型对抗性攻击方法，通过高斯斑块在严格黑盒设置下生成可物理转移的对抗性补丁，有效降低人脸识别系统的识别率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗性攻击多局限于数字域或需要白盒访问，缺乏在黑盒设置下的实用攻击方法。

Method: 使用零阶贪婪算法迭代构建对称灰度图案，通过高斯斑块优化，仅依赖余弦相似度分数。

Result: 在约10,000次查询后，GaP在数字和物理测试中均表现出高攻击成功率，并能迁移到未训练的FaceNet模型。

Conclusion: GaP揭示了人脸识别系统的严重漏洞，证明在黑盒设置下也能构建强迁移性攻击。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks on face recognition (FR) systems pose a significant
security threat, yet most are confined to the digital domain or require
white-box access. We introduce GaP (Gaussian Patch), a novel method to generate
a universal, physically transferable adversarial patch under a strict black-box
setting. Our approach uses a query-efficient, zero-order greedy algorithm to
iteratively construct a symmetric, grayscale pattern for the forehead. The
patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the
cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade
identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to
a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success
rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack
shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet
model. Our work highlights a practical and severe vulnerability, proving that
robust, transferable attacks can be crafted with limited knowledge of the
target system.

real-time tongue contour segmentation remains challenging due to low
signal-to-noise ratios, imaging variability, and computational demands. We

real-time segmentation of tongue contours in ultrasound images. UltraUNet
incorporates domain-specific innovations such as lightweight
Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks, Group Normalization for small-batch stability,
and summation-based skip connections to reduce memory and computational
overhead. It achieves 250 frames per second and integrates ultrasound-specific
augmentations like denoising and blur simulation. Evaluations on 8 datasets
demonstrate high accuracy and robustness, with single-dataset Dice = 0.855 and
MSD = 0.993px, and cross-dataset Dice averaging 0.734 and 0.761. UltraUNet
provides a fast, accurate solution for speech research, clinical diagnostics,

*Seongsoo Heo,Dong-Wan Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRI（Patch Rebirth Inversion）是一种新的模型反演方法，通过逐步分离重要补丁并允许其他补丁继续演化，显著提高了效率，同时保持了知识转移的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏模型反演（SMI）方法过早丢弃补丁，抑制了类无关特征的提取，影响了知识转移效果。

Method: 提出PRI方法，逐步分离重要补丁，同时让剩余补丁继续演化，以平衡类无关和类特定知识。

Result: PRI比标准DMI快10倍，比SMI快2倍，且准确性与DMI相当，优于SMI。

Conclusion: PRI通过Re-Birth效应高效平衡知识转移，显著提升了模型反演的效率和性能。

Abstract: Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that
reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative
optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its
application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major
computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To
address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency
by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even
claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings
suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire
transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that
discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses
the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer,
along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth
Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most
important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic
images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future
selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also
encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more
class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect,
thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge.
Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than
standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently
outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注或外部监督，成本高且不高效。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提高了事实基础和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部监督，高效且可扩展，同时保持了指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent
objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing
methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or
external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a
novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long
responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We
observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses,
which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated
responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed
model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency
signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without
human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on
self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable
and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled
data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER,
MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate
significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our
approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by
enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有服装推荐方法依赖大规模标注数据和任务特定训练，且缺乏明确的美学指导。

Method: 使用MLLMs生成目标描述和美学链式思维，通过动态熵门机制融合视觉和文本信息。

Result: 在Aesthetic-100和Polyvore数据集上表现优于现有训练方法。

Conclusion: TATTOO展示了无需训练的方法在美学感知服装推荐中的潜力。

Abstract: The global fashion e-commerce market relies significantly on intelligent and
aesthetic-aware outfit-completion tools to promote sales. While previous
studies have approached the problem of fashion outfit-completion and
compatible-item retrieval, most of them require expensive, task-specific
training on large-scale labeled data, and no effort is made to guide outfit
recommendation with explicit human aesthetics. In the era of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs), we show that the conventional training-based pipeline
could be streamlined to a training-free paradigm, with better recommendation
scores and enhanced aesthetic awareness. We achieve this with TATTOO, a
Training-free AesTheTic-aware Outfit recommendation approach. It first
generates a target-item description using MLLMs, followed by an aesthetic
chain-of-thought used to distill the images into a structured aesthetic profile
including color, style, occasion, season, material, and balance. By fusing the
visual summary of the outfit with the textual description and aesthetics
vectors using a dynamic entropy-gated mechanism, candidate items can be
represented in a shared embedding space and be ranked accordingly. Experiments
on a real-world evaluation set Aesthetic-100 show that TATTOO achieves
state-of-the-art performance compared with existing training-based methods.
Another standard Polyvore dataset is also used to measure the advanced
zero-shot retrieval capability of our training-free method.

Motivation: 热成像在ADAS中具有优势，但数据集和模拟器支持不足，现有RGB到热成像转换方法局限于一对一映射。

Method: 采用多模态转换框架，结合Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN)，对不同图像组件单独适配风格。

Result: 生成的转换图像更真实且多样化。

Conclusion: CoAdaIN方法有效提升了RGB到热成像转换的多样性和真实性，为ADAS提供了更好的数据支持。

Abstract: Thermal imaging in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) improves road
safety with superior perception in low-light and harsh weather conditions
compared to traditional RGB cameras. However, research in this area faces
challenges due to limited dataset availability and poor representation in
driving simulators. RGB-to-thermal image translation offers a potential
solution, but existing methods focus on one-to-one mappings. We propose a
one-to-many mapping using a multi-modal translation framework enhanced with our
Component-aware Adaptive Instance Normalization (CoAdaIN). Unlike the original
AdaIN, which applies styles globally, CoAdaIN adapts styles to different image
components individually. The result, as we show, is more realistic and diverse
thermal image translations. This is the accepted author manuscript of the paper
published in IEEE Sensors Conference 2024. The final published version is

Method: 将LiDAR帧映射为邻近图（epsilon-graph），计算拉普拉斯谱，利用特征值和特征向量统计形成姿态描述符，通过滑动窗口时间统计生成固定向量，用于支持向量机和随机森林分类。

Conclusion: 该方法直接从点云几何中提取紧凑且可解释的特征集，为端到端深度学习提供了高效替代方案。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition supports applications in healthcare,
manufacturing, and human-machine interaction. LiDAR point clouds offer a
privacy-preserving alternative to cameras and are robust to illumination. We
propose a HAR method based on graph spectral analysis. Each LiDAR frame is
mapped to a proximity graph (epsilon-graph) and the Laplacian spectrum is
computed. Eigenvalues and statistics of eigenvectors form pose descriptors, and
temporal statistics over sliding windows yield fixed vectors for classification
with support vector machines and random forests. On the MM-Fi dataset with 40
subjects and 27 activities, under a strict subject-independent protocol, the
method reaches 94.4% accuracy on a 13-class rehabilitation set and 90.3% on all
27 activities. It also surpasses the skeleton-based baselines reported for
MM-Fi. The contribution is a compact and interpretable feature set derived
directly from point cloud geometry that provides an accurate and efficient
alternative to end-to-end deep learning.

Result: 在Mip-NeRF 360和NeRF Synthetic数据集上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OracleGS通过结合生成先验和多视角几何证据，有效减少幻觉伪影，保持合理补全。

Abstract: Sparse-view novel view synthesis is fundamentally ill-posed due to severe
geometric ambiguity. Current methods are caught in a trade-off: regressive
models are geometrically faithful but incomplete, whereas generative models can
complete scenes but often introduce structural inconsistencies. We propose
OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with
regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using
generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our
"propose-and-validate" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware
diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then
repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the
3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions
where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus
where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of
texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the
optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss.
Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric
evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible
completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art
methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.

Abstract: Accurate monsoon rainfall prediction is vital for India's agriculture, water
management, and climate risk planning, yet remains challenging due to sparse
ground observations and complex regional variability. We present a multimodal
deep learning framework for high-resolution precipitation classification that
leverages satellite and Earth observation data. Unlike previous rainfall
prediction models based on coarse 5-50 km grids, we curate a new 1 km
resolution dataset for five Indian states, integrating seven key geospatial
modalities: land surface temperature, vegetation (NDVI), soil moisture,
relative humidity, wind speed, elevation, and land use, covering the
June-September 2024 monsoon season. Our approach uses an attention-guided U-Net
architecture to capture spatial patterns and temporal dependencies across
modalities, combined with focal and dice loss functions to handle rainfall
class imbalance defined by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).
Experiments demonstrate that our multimodal framework consistently outperforms
unimodal baselines and existing deep learning methods, especially in extreme
rainfall categories. This work contributes a scalable framework, benchmark
dataset, and state-of-the-art results for regional monsoon forecasting, climate
resilience, and geospatial AI applications in India.

Abstract: Domain-specific Visually Rich Document Understanding (VRDU) presents
significant challenges due to the complexity and sensitivity of documents in
fields such as medicine, finance, and material science. Existing Large
(Multimodal) Language Models (LLMs/MLLMs) achieve promising results but face
limitations such as hallucinations, inadequate domain adaptation, and reliance
on extensive fine-tuning datasets. This paper introduces SynDoc, a novel
framework that combines discriminative and generative models to address these
challenges. SynDoc employs a robust synthetic data generation workflow, using
structural information extraction and domain-specific query generation to
produce high-quality annotations. Through adaptive instruction tuning, SynDoc
improves the discriminative model's ability to extract domain-specific
knowledge. At the same time, a recursive inferencing mechanism iteratively
refines the output of both models for stable and accurate predictions. This
framework demonstrates scalable, efficient, and precise document understanding
and bridges the gap between domain-specific adaptation and general world
knowledge for document key information extraction tasks.

Result: 实验表明，Vid-Freeze能有效生成静态或接近静态的视频，阻止恶意内容生成。

Conclusion: 注意力攻击是防御I2V模型滥用的有效方向，Vid-Freeze展示了其潜力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-to-video (I2V) generation models has introduced
significant risks, enabling video synthesis from static images and facilitating
deceptive or malicious content creation. While prior defenses such as I2VGuard
attempt to immunize images, effective and principled protection to block motion
remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Vid-Freeze - a novel
attention-suppressing adversarial attack that adds carefully crafted
adversarial perturbations to images. Our method explicitly targets the
attention mechanism of I2V models, completely disrupting motion synthesis while
preserving semantic fidelity of the input image. The resulting immunized images
generate stand-still or near-static videos, effectively blocking malicious
content creation. Our experiments demonstrate the impressive protection
provided by the proposed approach, highlighting the importance of attention
attacks as a promising direction for robust and proactive defenses against
misuse of I2V generation models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of
photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and
fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake
scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader
AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such
content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the
integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a
physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that
defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a
depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured
images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images
often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these
discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative
feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or
frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging
principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and
generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature
analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a
reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our
defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute
meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics. The implementation is

Abstract: Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution,
shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras,
spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike
streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction
methods to become perceptible to the human eye.
  However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light
high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work,
we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike
camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture
information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an
\textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{T}exture \textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \textbf{I}nterval
(ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI
serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed
scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature
fusion module during the generation process.
  Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike
stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction
datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The
performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of
Diff-SPK.

Abstract: Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing
data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate
complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different
sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have
attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful
ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However,
pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively
leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature
extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper
proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages
multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover
classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy
to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral
image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features
hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer
networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and
cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to
enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and
feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four
multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior classification performance. The code is available at

*Haorui Yu,Qiufeng Yi,Yijia Chu,Yang Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs表面上有文化理解能力，实则依赖浅层模式匹配，存在系统性偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示VLMs在文化理解上的不足，尤其是对非西方文化的误判和紧急场景的危险分类。

Method: 通过分类和解释分析，测试VLMs对西方节日、非西方传统和紧急场景的理解。

Result: 模型能识别西方节日，但对非西方文化和紧急场景表现不佳，常给出模糊或错误标签。

Conclusion: 需超越准确率指标，进行文化评估以确保多模态系统的可解释性和公平性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often appear culturally competent but rely on
superficial pattern matching rather than genuine cultural understanding. We
introduce a diagnostic framework to probe VLM reasoning on fire-themed cultural
imagery through both classification and explanation analysis. Testing multiple
models on Western festivals, non-Western traditions, and emergency scenes
reveals systematic biases: models correctly identify prominent Western
festivals but struggle with underrepresented cultural events, frequently
offering vague labels or dangerously misclassifying emergencies as
celebrations. These failures expose the risks of symbolic shortcuts and
highlight the need for cultural evaluation beyond accuracy metrics to ensure
interpretable and fair multimodal systems.

Motivation: 解决目标检测在未见类别和恶劣环境下的泛化性和鲁棒性问题。

Method: 采用两阶段课程学习：第一阶段用RGBT数据增强鲁棒性，第二阶段通过视觉-语言对齐提升泛化性，引入EMA机制防止遗忘。

Result: 在FLIR、OV-COCO和OV-LVIS数据集上表现优异，AP50分别达到80.1、48.6和35.7。

Conclusion: C3-OWD成功统一了鲁棒性和多样性，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but
real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to
unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior
research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection
improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection
leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but
struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and
diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we
propose \textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning
framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by
pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via
vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two
stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that
theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded
parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and
OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$
AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$
mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness
and diversity evaluations. Code available at:

Motivation: 现有深度学习模型计算复杂度高，难以在资源受限设备上应用，而二值神经网络（BNN）在遥感图像融合中存在光谱失真和空间特征退化问题。

Method: 设计了S2B-Conv，包含光谱重分布机制（SRM）和Gabor空间特征放大器（GSFA），分别解决光谱不一致性和多尺度空间特征适应问题。

Result: 实验表明，S2BNet在高效二值化条件下实现了良好的性能。

Conclusion: S2BNet为资源受限设备提供了一种高效的遥感图像融合解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties
during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution
multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution
multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have
achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational
complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In
this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network
(BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with
binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious
spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the
PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to
adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing
objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above
issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution
(S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM)
and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine
transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic
learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles
within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional
spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for
pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can
attain a promising performance.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的解耦视觉推理方法，通过分离推理和感知过程，显著减少视觉无关推理步骤并提高推理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型（LMMs）在长推理链中过度依赖文本逻辑，逐渐脱离视觉信息，导致错误结论。

Method: 使用强大的LLM协调高层推理，策略性地询问LMM以提取所需视觉信息，LMM仅作为视觉问答引擎。

Result: 框架有效控制视觉推理过程，显著减少视觉无关推理步骤，大幅提升推理准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，无需额外训练或架构修改，显著改善了多模态模型的视觉推理能力。

Abstract: Significant advancements in the reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models (LLMs) are now driven by test-time scaling laws, particularly those
leveraging extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. Inspired by these
breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal
Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning
chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing
grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths
that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To
address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free
visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and
perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning,
strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information
required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a
visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on
demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional
training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our
framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a
significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial
improvement in reasoning fidelity.

TL;DR: Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP) 是一种无需重放且参数高效的方法，解决了多标签类增量学习中的语义混淆和部分标签问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接扩展单标签类增量学习的基于提示的方法到多标签场景效果不佳，主要由于共现类别的语义混淆和部分标签导致的假阳性问题。

Method: DDP 使用类特定的正负提示解耦语义，并引入渐进置信解耦 (PCD) 策略抑制假阳性。冻结过去的提示作为知识锚点，层间提示提高效率。

Result: 在 MS-COCO 和 PASCAL VOC 上，DDP 表现优于现有方法，首次在标准 MS-COCO B40-C10 基准上超过 80% mAP 和 70% F1。

Conclusion: DDP 是首个无需重放的多标签类增量学习方法，有效解决了语义混淆和假阳性问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have shown strong effectiveness in single-label
class-incremental learning, but their direct extension to multi-label
class-incremental learning (MLCIL) performs poorly due to two intrinsic
challenges: semantic confusion from co-occurring categories and
true-negative-false-positive confusion caused by partial labeling. We propose
Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework
that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific
positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive
Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that
suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and
interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP
consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL
approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10
benchmark.

Motivation: 盲人脸恢复（BFR）存在大解空间探索困难，导致恢复图像细节缺失和身份模糊。

Method: 提出LRPO框架，结合复合奖励函数、真实数据引导的正则化和噪声级别优势分配。

Result: 实验表明LRPO显著优于基线方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LRPO通过强化学习优化策略，有效平衡感知质量和保真度，提升人脸恢复效果。

Abstract: Blind Face Restoration (BFR) encounters inherent challenges in exploring its
large solution space, leading to common artifacts like missing details and
identity ambiguity in the restored images. To tackle these challenges, we
propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the
first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO
leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network,
increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration
performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates
incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate
significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and
fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function
tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood
regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration
quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 使用大规模双语数据集（11万张图像和246万VQA对）开发DentVLM，支持7种2D成像模态和36项诊断任务。

Result: DentVLM在口腔疾病和错颌畸形诊断中分别提升19.6%和27.9%的准确率，临床研究中表现优于部分牙医，并减少诊断时间15-22%。

Conclusion: DentVLM是强大的临床决策支持工具，可提升初级牙科护理质量，缓解医患资源不平衡，并普及专业医疗知识。

Abstract: Diagnosing and managing oral diseases necessitate advanced visual
interpretation across diverse imaging modalities and integrated information
synthesis. While current AI models excel at isolated tasks, they often fall
short in addressing the complex, multimodal requirements of comprehensive
clinical dental practice. Here we introduce DentVLM, a multimodal
vision-language model engineered for expert-level oral disease diagnosis.
DentVLM was developed using a comprehensive, large-scale, bilingual dataset of
110,447 images and 2.46 million visual question-answering (VQA) pairs. The
model is capable of interpreting seven 2D oral imaging modalities across 36
diagnostic tasks, significantly outperforming leading proprietary and
open-source models by 19.6% higher accuracy for oral diseases and 27.9% for
malocclusions. In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946
patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic
performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12
senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative
workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and
reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM
exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios,
including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent
diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish
DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary
dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to
specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.

Motivation: 现有RL方法在文本到图像生成中因采样策略低效导致探索成本高，需改进以提升生成质量和效率。

Method: 提出Dynamic-TreeRPO，采用树结构搜索和动态噪声强度，结合GRPO优化和约束SDE采样；整合SFT和RL为LayerTuning-RL，动态加权PRM避免探索中断。

Result: 在HPS-v2.1、PickScore和ImageReward基准上，模型性能分别提升4.9%、5.91%和8.66%，训练效率提高近50%。

Conclusion: Dynamic-TreeRPO和LayerTuning-RL通过高效探索和动态优化，显著提升文本到图像生成的性能与效率。

Abstract: The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for
text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation
quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration
and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling
group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements
the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic
noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and
constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree
structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively
amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed
noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the
variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we
seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within
Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the
loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM)
rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM
with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in
Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and
the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search
space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach
demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual
fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including
HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA
by $4.9\%$, $5.91\%$, and $8.66\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while
improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\%$.

Motivation: 当前深度配准网络缺乏预测可靠性的指示，现有不确定性估计方法需要架构更改或重新训练，限制了其适用性。

Method: 基于配准的变换等变性，通过分析输入空间扰动下网络预测的方差，分解不确定性为内在扩散和偏差抖动。

Result: 在多个解剖结构和配准模型中，不确定性图与配准误差一致，并突出需要谨慎的区域。

Conclusion: 该框架将预训练配准网络转化为风险感知工具，推动医学图像配准在临床和大规模研究中的安全应用。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is essential for downstream applications, yet
current deep registration networks provide limited indications of whether and
when their predictions are reliable. Existing uncertainty estimation
strategies, such as Bayesian methods, ensembles, or MC dropout, require
architectural changes or retraining, limiting their applicability to pretrained
registration networks. Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation
framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is
grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which
states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under
spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network
predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of
perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates
into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a
bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across
four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple
registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate
consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution.
Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool
at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe
deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.

<details>

Motivation: CLIP模型在处理多语言、长文本或多模态查询时表现不佳，现有方法缺乏监督信号，无法生成最优查询。

Method: 提出GRAPE方法，利用GRPO和基于排名的奖励机制，优化查询重写以减少分布差异。

Result: 在多种分布偏移任务中，GRAPE平均提升Recall@10达4.9%。

Conclusion: GRAPE有效解决了CLIP模型的分布偏移问题，显著提升了检索性能。

Abstract: The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by
aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its
simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input
distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with
multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining,
existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language
models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level.
However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the
optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with
GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play
enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided
query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to
bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and
modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the
retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds
that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation,
where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of
their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative
ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics
while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional
shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600),
length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving
an average improvement of 4.9\% in Recall\@10. The code is available at

Result: 在ShapeNet-55上的实验表明，CasPoinTr在形状恢复和细节保留上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 级联结构和蒸馏策略有效弥合不完整输入与完整目标之间的差距。

Abstract: Point clouds collected from real-world environments are often incomplete due
to factors such as limited sensor resolution, single viewpoints, occlusions,
and noise. These challenges make point cloud completion essential for various
applications. A key difficulty in this task is predicting the overall shape and
reconstructing missing regions from highly incomplete point clouds. To address
this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using
cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the
completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which
generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this
information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output.
Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds
transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model,
enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing
regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the
model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details,
effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets.
Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that
CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail
preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and
distillation strategy.

<details>

Motivation: 解决3D人体姿态估计中需要大量标注数据的问题，利用易获取的RGB-D序列和现有2D标注数据。

Method: 通过2D姿态估计作为弱监督，结合时空约束和跨模态交互，实现2D到3D的迁移。

Result: 在CMU Panoptic和ITOP数据集上表现与全监督方法相当，利用无标注数据进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: UniPose在减少标注需求的同时，实现了高性能的3D姿态估计，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, we present UniPose, a unified cross-modality pose prior
propagation method for weakly supervised 3D human pose estimation (HPE) using
unannotated single-view RGB-D sequences (RGB, depth, and point cloud data).
UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS
COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D
sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations.
This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from
issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data
shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as
weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal
constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection
loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating
the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our
anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth
networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared
to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show
that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods.
Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its
performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for
practical applications. Our proposed 3D lifting method also achieves
state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: 形状条件在自接触建模中起关键作用，Goliath-SC数据集和生成模型为相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: One can hardly model self-contact of human poses without considering
underlying body shapes. For example, the pose of rubbing a belly for a person
with a low BMI leads to penetration of the hand into the belly for a person
with a high BMI. Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the
variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive
analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by
introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape
registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130
subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact
prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent
diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into
single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in
contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the
successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving
single-view pose estimation in self-contact.

Method: 1. 使用4D感知潜在扩散模型生成像素对齐的4D高斯分布；2. 通过增强的视频扩散模型优化新视角视频。

Result: 实验表明，WorldSplat能生成高保真、时空一致的多视角驾驶视频。

Conclusion: WorldSplat在驾驶场景生成和重建之间取得了平衡，为自动驾驶系统提供了高质量的生成数据。

Abstract: Recent advances in driving-scene generation and reconstruction have
demonstrated significant potential for enhancing autonomous driving systems by
producing scalable and controllable training data. Existing generation methods
primarily focus on synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity driving videos;
however, due to limited 3D consistency and sparse viewpoint coverage, they
struggle to support convenient and high-quality novel-view synthesis (NVS).
Conversely, recent 3D/4D reconstruction approaches have significantly improved
NVS for real-world driving scenes, yet inherently lack generative capabilities.
To overcome this dilemma between scene generation and reconstruction, we
propose \textbf{WorldSplat}, a novel feed-forward framework for 4D
driving-scene generation. Our approach effectively generates consistent
multi-track videos through two key steps: ((i)) We introduce a 4D-aware latent
diffusion model integrating multi-modal information to produce pixel-aligned 4D
Gaussians in a feed-forward manner. ((ii)) Subsequently, we refine the novel
view videos rendered from these Gaussians using a enhanced video diffusion
model. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
\textbf{WorldSplat} effectively generates high-fidelity, temporally and
spatially consistent multi-track novel view driving videos.

*Yuyang Sun,Junchuan Yu,Cuiming Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Fracture-YOLO模型通过引入CRSelector和ScA模块，显著提升了骨折检测的精度，达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统骨折诊断依赖医生经验，速度和准确性受限，AI技术可提升效率和精度。

Method: 改进YOLO框架，加入CRSelector（关注关键区域）和ScA（多尺度特征权重调整）模块。

Result: mAP50和mAP50-95分别提升4和3，超越基线模型。

Conclusion: Fracture-YOLO在骨折检测中表现优异，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Fracture detection plays a critical role in medical imaging analysis,
traditional fracture diagnosis relies on visual assessment by experienced
physicians, however the speed and accuracy of this approach are constrained by
the expertise. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, deep
learning models based on the YOLO framework have been widely employed for
fracture detection, demonstrating significant potential in improving diagnostic
efficiency and accuracy. This study proposes an improved YOLO-based model,
termed Fracture-YOLO, which integrates novel Critical-Region-Selector Attention
(CRSelector) and Scale-Aware (ScA) heads to further enhance detection
performance. Specifically, the CRSelector module utilizes global texture
information to focus on critical features of fracture regions. Meanwhile, the
ScA module dynamically adjusts the weights of features at different scales,
enhancing the model's capacity to identify fracture targets at multiple scales.
Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to the baseline model,
Fracture-YOLO achieves a significant improvement in detection precision, with
mAP50 and mAP50-95 increasing by 4 and 3, surpassing the baseline model and
achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

TL;DR: FracDetNet是一种先进的骨折检测框架，通过双焦点注意力和多尺度校准提升检测性能，在公开数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中骨折检测的挑战，尤其是针对细微和形态多样的骨折，提升临床诊断效率。

Method: 结合双焦点注意力（DFA）和多尺度校准（MC），DFA捕捉局部细节和全局上下文，MC优化特征表示。

Result: 在GRAZPEDWRI-DX数据集上，mAP$_{50-95}$达到40.0%（提升7.5%），mAP$_{50}$为63.9%（提升4.2%）。

Conclusion: FracDetNet显著提升了骨折检测的准确性和效率，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: In this paper, an advanced fracture detection framework, FracDetNet, is
proposed to address challenges in medical imaging, as accurate fracture
detection is essential for enhancing diagnostic efficiency in clinical
practice. Despite recent advancements, existing methods still struggle with
detecting subtle and morphologically diverse fractures due to variable imaging
angles and suboptimal image quality. To overcome these limitations, FracDetNet
integrates Dual-Focus Attention (DFA) and Multi-scale Calibration (MC).
Specifically, the DFA module effectively captures detailed local features and
comprehensive global context through combined global and local attention
mechanisms. Additionally, the MC adaptively refines feature representations to
enhance detection performance. Experimental evaluations on the publicly
available GRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with
FracDetNet achieving a mAP$_{50-95}$ of 40.0\%, reflecting a \textbf{7.5\%}
improvement over the baseline model. Furthermore, the mAP$_{50}$ reaches
63.9\%, representing an increase of \textbf{4.2\%}, with fracture-specific
detection accuracy also enhanced by \textbf{2.9\%}.

TL;DR: SPIKE框架通过量化贝叶斯惊喜来定位视频中的关键时刻，结合SPIKE-RL优化信念假设，提升视频理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实视频中常有常规活动与意外事件交替，但现有Video-LLMs均匀采样帧可能忽略关键叙事时刻。

Method: 提出SPIKE框架量化贝叶斯惊喜，SPIKE-RL用GRPO优化信念假设，实现基于惊喜的帧采样。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于均匀采样，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: SPIKE为Video-LLMs提供动态更新理解的能力，推动更鲁棒的模型发展。

Abstract: Real-world videos often show routine activities punctuated by memorable,
surprising events. However, most Video-LLMs process videos by sampling frames
uniformly, likely missing critical moments that define a video's narrative. We
introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise
as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream,
identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs.
SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans
on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs
of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which
leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the
video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame
sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With
this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream
benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and
register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can
revise their understanding in response to new information.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FM-SIREN和FM-FINER通过神经元特定的频率乘数减少特征冗余，提升信号重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于周期性激活的隐式神经表示网络（如SIREN和FINER）存在隐藏特征冗余问题，限制了多层感知机的表达能力。

Method: 提出FM-SIREN和FM-FINER，采用基于Nyquist的神经元特定频率乘数，无需超参数调整或增加网络深度。

Result: 特征冗余减少近50%，在多种任务（如1D音频、2D图像、3D形状重建和NeRF合成）中表现优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，显著提升了隐式神经表示网络的性能。

Abstract: Existing periodic activation-based implicit neural representation (INR)
networks, such as SIREN and FINER, suffer from hidden feature redundancy, where
neurons within a layer capture overlapping frequency components due to the use
of a fixed frequency multiplier. This redundancy limits the expressive capacity
of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). Drawing inspiration from classical signal
processing methods such as the Discrete Sine Transform (DST), we propose
FM-SIREN and FM-FINER, which assign Nyquist-informed, neuron-specific frequency
multipliers to periodic activations. Unlike existing approaches, our design
introduces frequency diversity without requiring hyperparameter tuning or
additional network depth. This simple yet principled modification reduces the
redundancy of features by nearly 50% and consistently improves signal
reconstruction across diverse INR tasks, including fitting 1D audio, 2D image
and 3D shape, and synthesis of neural radiance fields (NeRF), outperforming
their baseline counterparts while maintaining efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FoR-SALE框架，通过引入参考框架（FoR）改进文本到图像生成模型的空间理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成模型在处理非相机视角的空间描述时表现不佳，需引入参考框架以提升性能。

Method: 扩展SLD框架，结合视觉模块提取图像空间配置，映射空间描述到相机视角，生成并应用编辑操作。

Result: 在专门设计的基准测试中，FoR-SALE将SOTA模型的性能提升至多5.3%。

Conclusion: FoR-SALE通过参考框架显著提升了模型的空间理解能力，为多模态语言模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that
humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in
Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this
long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image
(T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant
performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other
than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of
Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE),
an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework
for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially
generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference
specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the
spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial
expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective
enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When
misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and
applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing
direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two
benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our
framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3%
using only a single round of correction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 3DPCNet是一个紧凑的、与估计器无关的模块，用于将单目3D姿态估计结果转换为一致的、以身体为中心的规范框架，从而简化运动分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D姿态估计生成的相机中心骨架信号依赖于视角，不利于健康和运动科学中的比较分析。

Method: 3DPCNet通过混合编码器（图卷积网络和Transformer）预测6D旋转，将姿态对齐到规范框架，并以自监督方式训练。

Result: 在MM-Fi基准测试中，3DPCNet将平均旋转误差从20°降至3.4°，平均关节位置误差从64mm降至47mm。

Conclusion: 3DPCNet能有效消除视角变化，生成物理上合理的运动分析信号。

Abstract: Monocular 3D pose estimators produce camera-centered skeletons, creating
view-dependent kinematic signals that complicate comparative analysis in
applications such as health and sports science. We present 3DPCNet, a compact,
estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to
rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its
hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network
with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism.
From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is
mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a
self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses,
guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose
reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error
from over 20$^{\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error
from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations
on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces
acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to
ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint
variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.

Result: 在DrawBench和CompBench上显著提升了概念覆盖率和人类评判的忠实度。

Conclusion: 该方法通过细粒度优化有效提升了文本到图像生成的组合忠实度。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, they often fail to
faithfully render all elements of complex prompts, frequently omitting or
misrepresenting specific objects and attributes. Test-time optimization has
emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining
generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a
fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional
faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely
solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input
prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and
concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level
correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts.
This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the
large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and
CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept
coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time
optimization and the base T2I model. Code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态FAS模型难以检测新目标域中的未知攻击，且DA在多模态FAS中尚未探索。

Method: 通过提取互补特征替代缺失模态、利用预测不确定性生成可靠伪标签，以及设计自适应机制防止模型退化。

Result: 实验证明MFAS-DANet具有高效性和最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MFAS-DANet在多模态FAS的域适应场景中表现出色，解决了关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent multi-modal face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have investigated the
potential of leveraging multiple modalities to distinguish live and spoof
faces. However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen
attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation
(DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof
attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major
challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy
pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing
modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities
to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to
reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose
deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across
different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an
adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations
and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.

Motivation: 当前图像恢复方法在性能和速度之间存在权衡，高精度模型速度慢，而快速模型效果差。现有静态特征匹配方法无法捕捉现代Transformer架构的动态特征生成。

Method: 提出RestoRect方法，通过修正流将特征蒸馏重新表述为生成过程，学生模型在潜在空间中学习生成教师质量的特征。结合Retinex理论、可学习各向异性扩散约束和三角色彩空间极化。

Result: 在15个图像恢复数据集、4个任务和8个指标上展示了优越结果，训练稳定性更好，收敛和推理速度更快。

Conclusion: RestoRect在保持恢复质量的同时，显著提升了训练效率和推理速度，适用于多种图像恢复任务。

Abstract: Current approaches for restoration of degraded images face a critical
trade-off: high-performance models are too slow for practical use, while fast
models produce poor results. Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge
to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how
modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose
'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for
restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature
distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize
teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our
framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with
learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space
polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge
transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized
transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection.
RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and
inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results
across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.

Conclusion: OriGS通过方向锚定的高维表示，有效解决了动态场景重建中的复杂变形问题，提升了重建质量。

Abstract: We present Orientation-anchored Gaussian Splatting (OriGS), a novel framework
for high-quality 4D reconstruction from casually captured monocular videos.
While recent advances extend 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic scenes via
various motion anchors, such as graph nodes or spline control points, they
often rely on low-rank assumptions and fall short in modeling complex,
region-specific deformations inherent to unconstrained dynamics. OriGS
addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in
scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates
principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable
structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose
Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time,
space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state. This
enables inferring region-specific deformation through principled conditioned
slicing, adaptively capturing diverse local dynamics in alignment with global
motion intent. Experiments demonstrate the superior reconstruction fidelity of
OriGS over mainstream methods in challenging real-world dynamic scenes.

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between intra-modality dependencies (the
contribution of an individual modality to a target task) and inter-modality
dependencies (the relationships between modalities and the target task) is
fundamental to advancing multi-modal learning. However, the nature of and
interaction between these dependencies within current benchmark evaluations
remains poorly characterized. In this work, we present a large-scale empirical
study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering
benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains
such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition,
and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision,
question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and
within benchmarks. We discover that numerous benchmarks intended to mitigate
text-only biases have inadvertently amplified image-only dependencies. This
characterization persists across model sizes, as larger models often use these
intra-modality dependencies to achieve high performance that mask an underlying
lack of multi-modal reasoning. We provide a quantitative characterization of
multi-modal datasets, enabling a principled approach to multi-modal benchmark
design and evaluation.

Conclusion: 该方法为息肉分割提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案，适用于临床和自动化诊断系统。

Abstract: Polyp segmentation is a critical step in colorectal cancer detection, yet it
remains challenging due to the diverse shapes, sizes, and low contrast
boundaries of polyps in medical imaging. In this work, we propose a novel
framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a
Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK
mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module,
iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling
the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA
module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by
aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we
employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature
dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient
information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by
introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a
unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the
art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union
scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational
cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a
robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising
applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.

Abstract: Humans can extract rich semantic information from minimal visual cues, as
demonstrated by point-light displays (PLDs), which consist of sparse sets of
dots localized to key joints of the human body. This ability emerges early in
development and is largely attributed to human embodied experience. Since PLDs
isolate body motion as the sole source of meaning, they represent key stimuli
for testing the constraints of action understanding in these systems. Here we
introduce ActPLD, the first benchmark to evaluate action processing in MLLMs
from human PLDs. Tested models include state-of-the-art proprietary and
open-source systems on single-actor and socially interacting PLDs. Our results
reveal consistently low performance across models, introducing fundamental gaps

Abstract: Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
in systemic sclerosis (SSc). Chest computed tomography (CT) is the primary
imaging modality for diagnosing and monitoring lung complications in SSc
patients. However, its role in disease progression and mortality prediction has
not yet been fully clarified. This study introduces a novel, large-scale
longitudinal chest CT analysis framework that utilizes radiomics and deep
learning to predict mortality associated with lung complications of SSc. We
collected and analyzed 2,125 CT scans from SSc patients enrolled in the
Northwestern Scleroderma Registry, conducting mortality analyses at one, three,
and five years using advanced imaging analysis techniques. Death labels were
assigned based on recorded deaths over the one-, three-, and five-year
intervals, confirmed by expert physicians. In our dataset, 181, 326, and 428 of
the 2,125 CT scans were from patients who died within one, three, and five
years, respectively. Using ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, and Swin Transformer we use
pre-trained models, and fine-tuned on 2,125 images of SSc patients. Models
achieved an AUC of 0.769, 0.801, 0.709 for predicting mortality within one-,
three-, and five-years, respectively. Our findings highlight the potential of
both radiomics and deep learning computational methods to improve early
detection and risk assessment of SSc-related interstitial lung disease, marking

TL;DR: 提出了一种资源感知的自适应超分辨率框架，优化模型校准和关键事件的高精度召回，在安全关键指标上达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键场景中，直接低分辨率训练虽然整体精度高，但预测校准差，可能导致危险。

Method: 采用资源感知自适应超分辨率框架，结合轻量级伪影检测器过滤超分辨率引起的幻觉。

Result: 在校准误差（ECE）、AUPR（嗜睡检测）和精确召回（手机使用检测）上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 该自适应框架在安全关键应用中可靠性最佳，是当前最优解决方案。

Abstract: Driver monitoring systems require not just high accuracy but reliable,
well-calibrated confidence scores for safety-critical deployment. While direct
low-resolution training yields high overall accuracy, it produces poorly
calibrated predictions that can be dangerous in safety-critical scenarios. We
propose a resource-aware adaptive super-resolution framework that optimizes for
model calibration and high precision-recall on critical events. Our approach
achieves state-of-the-art performance on safety-centric metrics: best
calibration (ECE of 5.8\% vs 6.2\% for LR-trained baselines), highest AUPR for
drowsiness detection (0.78 vs 0.74), and superior precision-recall for phone
use detection (0.74 vs 0.71). A lightweight artifact detector (0.3M parameters,
5.2ms overhead) provides additional safety by filtering SR-induced
hallucinations. While LR-trained video models serve as strong general-purpose
baselines, our adaptive framework represents the state-of-the-art solution for
safety-critical applications where reliability is paramount.

*Hongyang Li,Jinyuan Qu,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OVSeg3R是一种通过3D重建从2D感知模型学习开放词汇3D实例分割的训练方案，避免了手动调整并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用2D到3D的对应关系，避免手动标注成本，同时解决3D重建中几何细节丢失的问题。

Method: 采用2D实例掩码投影到3D，提出视图实例分区算法和2D实例边界感知超点聚类。

Result: 在ScanNet200基准上提升2.3 mAP，新类上超越之前方法7.1 mAP。

Conclusion: OVSeg3R有效扩展了开放词汇3D分割能力，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn
open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models
with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes
from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input
with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences
provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance
mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to
generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid
incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial
annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm,
which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision,
stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models
tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into
representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in
mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient
objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which
leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing
superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not
only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation
model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap
between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of
+2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard
open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP
on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 探讨3DGS在SLAM、远程呈现、机器人操作和3D内容生成等领域的应用，分析其技术优势、适应性和局限性。

Method: 通过系统比较不同领域的3DGS应用流程，回答其技术优势、适应性和局限性等研究问题。

Result: 3DGS在渲染质量、几何保真度和计算效率之间取得了平衡，适用于多种任务。

Conclusion: 3DGS为神经渲染在感知、交互和内容创作中的应用提供了路线图，适用于真实和虚拟环境。

Abstract: Neural scene representations such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have transformed how 3D environments are modeled,
rendered, and interpreted. NeRF introduced view-consistent photorealism via
volumetric rendering; 3DGS has rapidly emerged as an explicit, efficient
alternative that supports high-quality rendering, faster optimization, and
integration into hybrid pipelines for enhanced photorealism and task-driven
scene understanding. This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across
SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content
generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals:
photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream
tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain
why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical
advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities
and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically
comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism,
geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap
for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for
perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual
environments.

Motivation: 胰腺疾病具有区域异质性，准确分区对诊断和治疗至关重要，但MRI分割因形态多变和对比度差而困难。

Method: 采用隐私保护的联邦学习框架，结合多种分割模型（U-Net、Attention U-Net、Swin UNETR）和FL算法（FedAvg、FedProx），并设计解剖学损失函数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了胰腺MRI分割的技术和数据挑战，为临床提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present the first federated learning (FL) approach for pancreas part(head,
body and tail) segmentation in MRI, addressing a critical clinical challenge as
a significant innovation. Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional
heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic
pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of
the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and
treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in
MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical
variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental
challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in
MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches.
We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model
training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing,
leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key
innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art
segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two
FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as
optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a
novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture
contrasts in MRI. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach
achieves clinically viable performance despite training on distributed,
heterogeneous datasets.

Motivation: 传统静态地图成本高、更新慢且泛化能力差，限制了自动驾驶的可扩展性。

Method: 系统回顾了矢量化地图构建、拓扑结构建模、先验知识融合和基于语言模型的感知四个方向。

Result: 动态表示利用传感器数据实现实时地图构建和拓扑推理，推动更自适应、可扩展的系统。

Conclusion: 这些方向共同促进了更灵活、可解释的自动驾驶系统发展。

Abstract: The key to achieving autonomous driving lies in topology-aware perception,
the structured understanding of the driving environment with an emphasis on
lane topology and road semantics. This survey systematically reviews four core
research directions under this theme: vectorized map construction, topological
structure modeling, prior knowledge fusion, and language model-based
perception. Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm
shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception.
Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for
autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update
in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their
scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data
for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four
research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling,
semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and
multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models.
Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable
autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法通过将大脑信号映射到中间图像或文本特征空间来指导生成过程，掩盖了不同大脑区域对最终重建输出的贡献。

Method: 提出NeuroAdapter框架，直接在大脑表征上条件化潜在扩散模型，并引入IBBI双向可解释性框架分析跨注意力机制。

Result: 在公共fMRI数据集上展示了竞争力的视觉重建质量，同时揭示了不同皮层区域如何影响生成轨迹。

Conclusion: 端到端的大脑到图像解码具有潜力，并为通过视觉神经科学视角解释扩散模型开辟了路径。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated that complex visual stimuli can be decoded from
human brain activity using deep generative models, helping brain science
researchers interpret how the brain represents real-world scenes. However, most
current approaches leverage mapping brain signals into intermediate image or
text feature spaces before guiding the generative process, masking the effect
of contributions from different brain areas on the final reconstruction output.
In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that
directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations,
bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates
competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to
prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape
the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain
BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates
cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how
different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our
results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and
establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of
visual neuroscience.

Result: 在基准数据集上表现出色，兼具高精度姿态估计和鲁棒跟踪能力。

Conclusion: 该框架在边缘设备上高效运行，适用于复杂光照条件下的实时姿态估计和跟踪。

Abstract: Robust 6D pose estimation of novel objects under challenging illumination
remains a significant challenge, often requiring a trade-off between accurate
initial pose estimation and efficient real-time tracking. We present a unified
framework explicitly designed for efficient execution on edge devices, which
synergizes a robust initial estimation module with a fast motion-based tracker.
The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature
representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages. For initial
estimation, this feature facilitates robust registration between the live RGB-D
view and the object's 3D mesh. For tracking, the same feature logic validates
temporal correspondences, enabling a lightweight model to reliably regress the
object's motion. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our integrated approach is both effective and robust, providing competitive
pose estimation accuracy while maintaining high-fidelity tracking even through
abrupt pose changes.

Motivation: DiTs在图像生成中表现出色，但计算和内存成本高，QAT应用于DiTs时面临激活量化的挑战。

Method: 提出RobustQuantizer和AMPN方法，结合Hadamard变换和混合精度分配，优化激活量化。

Result: 在4比特以下配置中，RobuQ在ImageNet-1K等数据集上实现稳定的2比特激活量化图像生成。

Conclusion: RobuQ是首个在DiTs中实现高效低比特量化的框架，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over
U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by
substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training
(QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique
challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of
activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary
bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we
propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by
establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon
this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our
theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown
per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong
foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first
Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies
ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation
precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through
extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our
RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in
sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is
the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets
like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits. The code and
models will be available at https://github.com/racoonykc/RobuQ .

Conclusion: VividFace为视频人脸增强提供了高效、高质量的解决方案，并推动了相关研究的发展。

Abstract: Video Face Enhancement (VFE) seeks to reconstruct high-quality facial regions
from degraded video sequences, a capability that underpins numerous
applications including video conferencing, film restoration, and surveillance.
Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely
on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three
fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while
preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the
lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by
repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we
propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video
face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our
method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow
matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality
outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency,
we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs
stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global
reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces
through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an
MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality
video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual
quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering
practical resources for the research community.

Conclusion: GRS-SLAM3R在密集场景重建中实现了全局一致性和高效性能。

Abstract: DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising
results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image
pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global
consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework
for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any
prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based
frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in
local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and
incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In
order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for
spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and
update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D
information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps,
apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a
common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent
map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖模拟图像，但其中包含大量无关信息（如背景、噪声），影响迁移质量。本文探索通过FSCM迁移更纯净的关键目标知识。

Method: 提出MHKT网络，从特征、分布和类别三个层次迁移FSCM知识，包括任务关联信息选择器（TAIS）、目标通用知识迁移（TGKT）模块和类别关系知识迁移（CRKT）模块。

Result: 在两个新数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能优越。

Conclusion: 通过逐步知识选择和迁移，确保了FSCM知识的完整性，显著提升了SAR目标识别效果。

Abstract: Simulated data-assisted SAR target recognition methods are the research
hotspot currently, devoted to solving the problem of limited samples. Existing
works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant
information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously
affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new
simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward
scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the
target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this
purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is
proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution
and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable
feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative
knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer
target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric
function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge
transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while
preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation
knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency
constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data
due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge
selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM
knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM
data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our
method.

Conclusion: 该框架通过整合真实世界场景和基础设施合作，显著提升了自动驾驶评估的逼真度和实用性。

Abstract: Closed-loop evaluation is increasingly critical for end-to-end autonomous
driving. Current closed-loop benchmarks using the CARLA simulator rely on
manually configured traffic scenarios, which can diverge from real-world
conditions, limiting their ability to reflect actual driving performance. To
address these limitations, we introduce a simple yet challenging closed-loop
evaluation framework that closely integrates real-world driving scenarios into
the CARLA simulator with infrastructure cooperation. Our approach involves
extracting 800 dynamic traffic scenarios selected from a comprehensive 100-hour
video dataset captured by high-mounted infrastructure sensors, and creating
static digital twin assets for 15 real-world intersections with consistent
visual appearance. These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and
environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more
realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the
diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day
at complex urban intersections. In addition, we provide a comprehensive
closed-loop benchmark for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving models.

Abstract: Recent Mamba-based image restoration methods have achieved promising results
but remain
  limited by fixed scanning patterns and inefficient feature utilization.
Conventional Mamba
  architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse
degradations, constraining
  both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these
limitations, we
  propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations.
First,
  QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha
  FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current
LoRA-adapted and
  cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while
effectively controlling
  memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning.
A
  Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a
greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These
learned trajectories replace rigid
  patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The
integration of QCLAM and
  GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while
maintaining high
  computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration
tasks demonstrate
  that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration
quality and

Abstract: Scalable and realistic simulation of multi-agent traffic behavior is critical
for advancing autonomous driving technologies. Although existing data-driven
simulators have made significant strides in this domain, they predominantly
rely on supervised learning to align simulated distributions with real-world
driving scenarios. A persistent challenge, however, lies in the distributional
shift that arises between training and testing, which often undermines model
generalization in unseen environments. To address this limitation, we propose
SMART-R1, a novel R1-style reinforcement fine-tuning paradigm tailored for
next-token prediction models to better align agent behavior with human
preferences and evaluation metrics. Our approach introduces a metric-oriented
policy optimization algorithm to improve distribution alignment and an
iterative "SFT-RFT-SFT" training strategy that alternates between Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) to maximize performance
gains. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Motion Dataset
(WOMD) validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful R1-style training
framework in enhancing foundation models. The results on the Waymo Open Sim
Agents Challenge (WOSAC) showcase that SMART-R1 achieves state-of-the-art
performance with an overall realism meta score of 0.7858, ranking first on the
leaderboard at the time of submission.

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上表现优异，发现丰富且可解释的层次分类。

Conclusion: 深度分类网络能有效发现层次关系，提升聚类性能。

Abstract: Inspired by the human ability to learn and organize knowledge into
hierarchical taxonomies with prototypes, this paper addresses key limitations
in current deep hierarchical clustering methods. Existing methods often tie the
structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype
information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep
taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge
these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy,
specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within
a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic
structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data
without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the
ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among
prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical
clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image
classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages
prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results
further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable
hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and
fine-grained visual distinctions.

Motivation: 扩散模型在低剂量CT去噪中表现出色，但计算成本极高，阻碍了临床应用。

Method: 通过感知优化的自动编码器在压缩潜在空间中操作，结合注意力条件U-Net实现快速确定性去噪。

Result: 在LDCT和投影数据集上，MAN在感知质量上超越CNN/GAN方法，与DDPM/Dn-Dp等扩散模型相当，且推理速度快60倍。

Conclusion: MAN为生成模型在医学影像中的实际应用提供了可行路径。

Abstract: While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose
Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically
hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding
thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a
Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and
High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a
compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an
attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic
conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On
the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual
quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction
fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most
critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than
representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on
PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical
viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced
generative models in medical imaging.

Result: 在780个概念对的基准测试中，VMDiff在视觉质量、语义一致性和人类评分创造力上优于基线。

Conclusion: VMDiff有效解决了多源图像生成中的关键挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Creating novel images by fusing visual cues from multiple sources is a
fundamental yet underexplored problem in image-to-image generation, with broad
applications in artistic creation, virtual reality and visual media. Existing
methods often face two key challenges: coexistent generation, where multiple
objects are simply juxtaposed without true integration, and bias generation,
where one object dominates the output due to semantic imbalance. To address
these issues, we propose Visual Mixing Diffusion (VMDiff), a simple yet
effective diffusion-based framework that synthesizes a single, coherent object
by integrating two input images at both noise and latent levels. Our approach
comprises: (1) a hybrid sampling process that combines guided denoising,
inversion, and spherical interpolation with adjustable parameters to achieve
structure-aware fusion, mitigating coexistent generation; and (2) an efficient
adaptive adjustment module, which introduces a novel similarity-based score to
automatically and adaptively search for optimal parameters, countering semantic
bias. Experiments on a curated benchmark of 780 concept pairs demonstrate that
our method outperforms strong baselines in visual quality, semantic
consistency, and human-rated creativity.

Conclusion: 这些方法在多样化机器人环境中表现出色，为视频生成提供了更强的可控性。

Abstract: Generating realistic robot videos from explicit action trajectories is a
critical step toward building effective world models and robotics foundation
models. We introduce two training-free, inference-time techniques that fully
exploit explicit action parameters in diffusion-based robot video generation.
Instead of treating action vectors as passive conditioning signals, our methods
actively incorporate them to guide both the classifier-free guidance process
and the initialization of Gaussian latents. First, action-scaled
classifier-free guidance dynamically modulates guidance strength in proportion
to action magnitude, enhancing controllability over motion intensity. Second,
action-scaled noise truncation adjusts the distribution of initially sampled
noise to better align with the desired motion dynamics. Experiments on real
robot manipulation datasets demonstrate that these techniques significantly
improve action coherence and visual quality across diverse robot environments.

Motivation: 传统3D LUT方法在计算效率高但表示能力有限，缺乏灵活性。FlowLUT旨在平衡效率与表示能力。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现出色，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: FlowLUT成功结合了效率和灵活性，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based image enhancement methods face a fundamental trade-off
between computational efficiency and representational capacity. For example,
although a conventional three-dimensional Look-Up Table (3D LUT) can process a
degraded image in real time, it lacks representational flexibility and depends
solely on a fixed prior. To address this problem, we introduce FlowLUT, a novel
end-to-end model that integrates the efficiency of LUTs, multiple priors, and
the parameter-independent characteristic of flow-matched reconstructed images.
Specifically, firstly, the input image is transformed in color space by a
collection of differentiable 3D LUTs (containing a large number of 3D LUTs with
different priors). Subsequently, a lightweight content-aware dynamically
predicts fusion weights, enabling scene-adaptive color correction with
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity. Next, a lightweight fusion prediction network runs
on multiple 3D LUTs, with $\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity for scene-adaptive color
correction.Furthermore, to address the inherent representation limitations of
LUTs, we design an innovative iterative flow matching method to restore local
structural details and eliminate artifacts. Finally, the entire model is
jointly optimized under a composite loss function enforcing perceptual and
structural fidelity. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on three benchmarks.

Conclusion: SCOPE通过连续语义先验和扩散模型，显著提升了类别级物体姿态估计的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Object manipulation requires accurate object pose estimation. In open
environments, robots encounter unknown objects, which requires semantic
understanding in order to generalize both to known categories and beyond. To
resolve this challenge, we present SCOPE, a diffusion-based category-level
object pose estimation model that eliminates the need for discrete category
labels by leveraging DINOv2 features as continuous semantic priors. By
combining these DINOv2 features with photorealistic training data and a noise
model for point normals, we reduce the Sim2Real gap in category-level object
pose estimation. Furthermore, injecting the continuous semantic priors via
cross-attention enables SCOPE to learn canonicalized object coordinate systems
across object instances beyond the distribution of known categories. SCOPE
outperforms the current state of the art in synthetically trained
category-level object pose estimation, achieving a relative improvement of
31.9\% on the 5$^\circ$5cm metric. Additional experiments on two instance-level
datasets demonstrate generalization beyond known object categories, enabling
grasping of unseen objects from unknown categories with a success rate of up to
100\%. Code available: https://github.com/hoenigpeter/scope.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的人机交互数据集交互类别不足且通常仅考虑静态物体，而收集可移动物体的数据集困难且成本高。

Method: 使用3D视觉定位模型识别交互对象，提出手-物体联合affordance学习预测接触区域，结合局部场景建模和碰撞避免约束优化交互。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在生成物理合理且符合文本的交互方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的任务和方法为3D场景中可移动物体的人机交互生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a novel task of text-controlled human object interaction
generation in 3D scenes with movable objects. Existing human-scene interaction
datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only
consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and
the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly.
To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable
Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object
interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1)
scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction
specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D
scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied
interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible
object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable
objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify
objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of
different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects
and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution.
We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object.
Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact
regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping
and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with
local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically
plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate our method's superiority in generating
physically plausible, text-compliant interactions compared to existing
approaches.

Abstract: Structural changes in retinal blood vessels are critical biomarkers for the
onset and progression of glaucoma and other ocular diseases. However, current
vessel segmentation approaches largely rely on supervised learning and
extensive manual annotations, which are costly, error-prone, and difficult to
obtain in optical coherence tomography angiography. Here we present
BioVessel-Net, an unsupervised generative framework that integrates vessel
biostatistics with adversarial refinement and a radius-guided segmentation
strategy. Unlike pixel-based methods, BioVessel-Net directly models vascular
structures with biostatistical coherence, achieving accurate and explainable
vessel extraction without labeled data or high-performance computing. To
support training and evaluation, we introduce RetinaMix, a new benchmark
dataset of 2D and 3D OCTA images with high-resolution vessel details from
diverse populations. Experimental results demonstrate that BioVessel-Net
achieves near-perfect segmentation accuracy across RetinaMix and existing
datasets, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art supervised and
semi-supervised methods. Together, BioVessel-Net and RetinaMix provide a
label-free, computationally efficient, and clinically interpretable solution
for retinal vessel analysis, with broad potential for glaucoma monitoring,
blood flow modeling, and progression prediction. Code and dataset are

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of floating debris on water is often compromised by
surface glare and changing outdoor illumination. Polarimetric imaging offers a
single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic
segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks
on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland
waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using
traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover
low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising
mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks
come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the
computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By
providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we
hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their
applications and to accelerate related research.

Result: DiffInk在字形准确性和风格保真度上优于现有方法，并显著提高生成效率。

Conclusion: DiffInk为全行手写生成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep generative models have advanced text-to-online handwriting generation
(TOHG), which aims to synthesize realistic pen trajectories conditioned on
textual input and style references. However, most existing methods still
primarily focus on character- or word-level generation, resulting in
inefficiency and a lack of holistic structural modeling when applied to full
text lines. To address these issues, we propose DiffInk, the first latent
diffusion Transformer framework for full-line handwriting generation. We first
introduce InkVAE, a novel sequential variational autoencoder enhanced with two
complementary latent-space regularization losses: (1) an OCR-based loss
enforcing glyph-level accuracy, and (2) a style-classification loss preserving
writing style. This dual regularization yields a semantically structured latent
space where character content and writer styles are effectively disentangled.
We then introduce InkDiT, a novel latent diffusion Transformer that integrates
target text and reference styles to generate coherent pen trajectories.
Experimental results demonstrate that DiffInk outperforms existing
state-of-the-art methods in both glyph accuracy and style fidelity, while
significantly improving generation efficiency. Code will be made publicly
available.

Motivation: 由于同步和校准的RGB-热图像对稀缺，限制了视觉-热传感器融合和跨模态任务的发展，因此需要一种有效的RGB-T图像转换方法。

Method: 提出ThermalGen模型，结合RGB图像条件架构和风格解耦机制，并利用多个公开数据集和新采集的大规模卫星-航空RGB-T数据集进行训练。

Conclusion: ThermalGen是首个能够合成多样化热图像的RGB-T转换模型，为跨模态任务提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Paired RGB-thermal data is crucial for visual-thermal sensor fusion and
cross-modality tasks, including important applications such as multi-modal
image alignment and retrieval. However, the scarcity of synchronized and
calibrated RGB-thermal image pairs presents a major obstacle to progress in
these areas. To overcome this challenge, RGB-to-Thermal (RGB-T) image
translation has emerged as a promising solution, enabling the synthesis of
thermal images from abundant RGB datasets for training purposes. In this study,
we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image
translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a
style-disentangled mechanism. To support large-scale training, we curated eight
public satellite-aerial, aerial, and ground RGB-T paired datasets, and
introduced three new large-scale satellite-aerial RGB-T datasets--DJI-day,
Bosonplus-day, and Bosonplus-night--captured across diverse times, sensor
types, and geographic regions. Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T
benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior
translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based
methods. To our knowledge, ThermalGen is the first RGB-T image translation
model capable of synthesizing thermal images that reflect significant
variations in viewpoints, sensor characteristics, and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: RIV通过自纠正机制显著提升了模型性能，达到了最先进水平。

Abstract: Mask Diffusion-based Vision Language Models (MDVLMs) have achieved remarkable
progress in multimodal understanding tasks. However, these models are unable to
correct errors in generated tokens, meaning they lack self-correction
capability. In this paper, we propose Recursive Introspection Mask Diffusion
Vision Language Model (RIV), which equips the model with self-correction
ability through two novel mechanisms. The first is Introspection Training,
where an Introspection Model is introduced to identify errors within generated
sequences. Introspection Training enables the model to detect not only
grammatical and spelling mistakes, but more importantly, logical errors. The
second is Recursive Inference. Beginning with the standard unmasking step, the
learned Introspection Model helps to identify errors in the output sequence and
remask them. This alternating
($\text{unmask}\rightarrow\text{introspection}\rightarrow\text{remask}$)
process is repeated recursively until reliable results are obtained.
Experimental results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed RIV
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming most existing MDVLMs.

Abstract: This paper develops a mathematical argument and algorithms for building
representations of data from event-based cameras, that we call Fast Feature
Field ($\text{F}^3$). We learn this representation by predicting future events
from past events and show that it preserves scene structure and motion
information. $\text{F}^3$ exploits the sparsity of event data and is robust to
noise and variations in event rates. It can be computed efficiently using ideas
from multi-resolution hash encoding and deep sets - achieving 120 Hz at HD and
440 Hz at VGA resolutions. $\text{F}^3$ represents events within a contiguous
spatiotemporal volume as a multi-channel image, enabling a range of downstream
tasks. We obtain state-of-the-art performance on optical flow estimation,
semantic segmentation, and monocular metric depth estimation, on data from
three robotic platforms (a car, a quadruped robot and a flying platform),
across different lighting conditions (daytime, nighttime), environments
(indoors, outdoors, urban, as well as off-road) and dynamic vision sensors
(resolutions and event rates). Our implementations can predict these tasks at
25-75 Hz at HD resolution.

Abstract: Multi-task dense prediction, which aims to jointly solve tasks like semantic
segmentation and depth estimation, is crucial for robotics applications but
suffers from domain shift when deploying models in new environments. While
unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) addresses this challenge for single tasks,
existing multi-task UDA methods primarily rely on adversarial learning
approaches that are less effective than recent self-training techniques. In
this paper, we introduce FAMDA, a simple yet effective UDA framework that
bridges this gap by leveraging Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) as powerful
teachers. Our approach integrates Segmentation and Depth foundation models into
a self-training paradigm to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for the target
domain, effectively distilling their robust generalization capabilities into a

TL;DR: MotionVerse是一个统一框架，利用LLMs理解和生成人体运动，支持单人和多人场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决运动数据的高效表示和多模态干扰问题。

Method: 使用运动分词器和延迟并行建模策略，结合双塔架构。

Result: 在多种运动相关任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: MotionVerse通过高效设计和多模态集成，显著提升了运动理解和生成能力。

Abstract: This paper proposes MotionVerse, a unified framework that harnesses the
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend, generate, and edit
human motion in both single-person and multi-person scenarios. To efficiently
represent motion data, we employ a motion tokenizer with residual quantization,
which converts continuous motion sequences into multi-stream discrete tokens.
Furthermore, we introduce a \textit{Delay Parallel} Modeling strategy, which
temporally staggers the encoding of residual token streams. This design enables
LLMs to effectively capture inter-stream dependencies while maintaining
computational efficiency comparable to single-stream modeling. Moreover, to
alleviate modality interference between motion and language, we design a
\textit{dual-tower architecture} with modality-specific parameters, ensuring
stable integration of motion information for both comprehension and generation
tasks. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of each
component in MotionVerse, and extensive experiments showcase its superior
performance across a wide range of motion-relevant tasks.

TL;DR: LightFair是一种轻量级方法，通过微调文本嵌入来提升文本到图像扩散模型的公平性，同时减少训练和采样负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要全参数训练或依赖辅助网络，导致训练和采样负担重且效果不佳。本文聚焦于文本编码器的偏差问题。

Method: 提出协作距离约束去偏策略，平衡嵌入距离以提升公平性，并引入两阶段文本引导采样策略以保持生成质量。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion v1.5上，LightFair仅需1/4的训练负担即达到SOTA去偏效果，且采样负担几乎不增加。

Conclusion: LightFair通过轻量级方法有效解决了文本编码器的偏差问题，显著提升了公平性和效率。

Abstract: This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair
text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of
the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the
diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for
correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory
performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text
encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on
mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we
observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial
skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More
importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To
finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained
debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness
without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the
original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage
text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder
intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and
efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA
debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in
sampling burden. The code is available at https://github.com/boyuh/LightFair.

TL;DR: EfficientMIL是一种线性复杂度的多实例学习方法，用于全切片图像分类，通过自适应补丁选择器（APS）和高效序列模型（如GRU、LSTM和Mamba）替代传统Transformer的自注意力机制，显著提升计算效率并超越现有方法。

Motivation: 解决现有基于注意力的多实例学习方法在计算资源上的高需求问题，尤其是处理数十万补丁时的二次复杂度瓶颈。

Method: 提出EfficientMIL，结合自适应补丁选择器（APS）和高效序列模型（如GRU、LSTM和Mamba），替代传统Transformer的自注意力机制。

Result: 在TCGA-Lung和CAMELYON16数据集上，EfficientMIL分别达到AUC 0.976/0.990和准确率0.933/0.975，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: EfficientMIL在计算效率和分类性能上均优于现有方法，APS在补丁选择上也更有效。

Abstract: Whole slide images (WSIs) classification represents a fundamental challenge
in computational pathology, where multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged
as the dominant paradigm. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) MIL methods rely on
attention mechanisms, achieving good performance but requiring substantial
computational resources due to quadratic complexity when processing hundreds of
thousands of patches. To address this computational bottleneck, we introduce
EfficientMIL, a novel linear-complexity MIL approach for WSIs classification
with the patches selection module Adaptive Patch Selector (APS) that we
designed, replacing the quadratic-complexity self-attention mechanisms in
Transformer-based MIL methods with efficient sequence models including
RNN-based GRU, LSTM, and State Space Model (SSM) Mamba. EfficientMIL achieves
significant computational efficiency improvements while outperforming other MIL
methods across multiple histopathology datasets. On TCGA-Lung dataset,
EfficientMIL-Mamba achieved AUC of 0.976 and accuracy of 0.933, while on
CAMELYON16 dataset, EfficientMIL-GRU achieved AUC of 0.990 and accuracy of
0.975, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that APS is also more effective for patches selection than
conventional selection strategies.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过图像而非文本控制多图像布局，实现更精细的图像生成控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本控制图像生成在需要更精确指导时存在局限性，因此需要一种更直观的方式定义内容和布局。

Method: 采用无需训练的方法，仅需单张参考图像，提供对象和部分级别的显式控制。

Result: 在多种图像合成任务中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为图像生成提供了更简单、更精确的布局控制。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have achieved a level of realism that enables the
generation of highly convincing images. However, text-based control can be a
limiting factor when more explicit guidance is needed. Defining both the
content and its precise placement within an image is crucial for achieving
finer control. In this work, we address the challenge of multi-image layout
control, where the desired content is specified through images rather than
text, and the model is guided on where to place each element. Our approach is
training-free, requires a single image per reference, and provides explicit and
simple control for object and part-level composition. We demonstrate its
effectiveness across various image composition tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sparse-Up是一个高效的高保真纹理建模框架，解决了高频细节丢失和内存消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在保持高频细节和多视角一致性之间存在权衡，导致纹理撕裂或分辨率受限。

Method: 采用稀疏体素引导纹理重建，结合表面锚定和视角域分区策略，减少冗余体素和内存消耗。

Result: 减少了70%的冗余体素，显著降低内存消耗，同时保持高频细节和几何一致性。

Conclusion: Sparse-Up在高效性和高保真纹理建模方面表现出色。

Abstract: The creation of high-fidelity 3D assets is often hindered by a 'pixel-level
pain point': the loss of high-frequency details. Existing methods often trade
off one aspect for another: either sacrificing cross-view consistency,
resulting in torn or drifting textures, or remaining trapped by the resolution
ceiling of explicit voxels, forfeiting fine texture detail. In this work, we
propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework
that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to
guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while
leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through
resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling
strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of
redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain
partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme,
supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches.
Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption
during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric
consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.

Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏复杂的多跳问题和高质量的视频推理链数据，限制了强化学习在视频推理中的应用。

Method: 提出ReWatch数据集，包括三个部分：ReWatch-Caption、ReWatch-QA和ReWatch-CoT，并通过多智能体框架生成视频推理链。开发ReWatch-R1模型，结合监督微调和强化学习框架。

Result: ReWatch-R1在五个视频推理基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: ReWatch数据集和ReWatch-R1模型显著提升了视频推理能力，解决了数据瓶颈问题。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) significantly
advances image reasoning in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), its
application to complex video reasoning remains underdeveloped. This gap stems
primarily from a critical data bottleneck: existing datasets lack the
challenging, multi-hop questions and high-quality, video-grounded
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data necessary to effectively bootstrap RLVR. To address
this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced
video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to
synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT.
A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which
simulates a human-like "re-watching" process to generate video-grounded
reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification.
Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong
baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This
framework incorporates a novel Observation \& Reasoning (O\&R) reward mechanism
that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's
alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination. Our
experiments show that ReWatch-R1 achieves state-of-the-art average performance
on five challenging video reasoning benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉编码器输出的视觉令牌数量庞大，严重影响推理效率，且许多令牌不重要，可以安全剪枝。

Method: 提出HIVTP方法，利用中间层注意力图估计令牌重要性，分全局和局部两阶段剪枝，保留重要令牌。

Result: HIVTP将LLaVA-v1.5-7B和LLaVA-Next-7B的TTFT分别减少50.0%和55.1%，吞吐量提升60.9%和47.3%，且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: HIVTP在保持或提升准确性的同时，显著提高了推理效率，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse
multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the
vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have
shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely
pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs
efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel
middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps
extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect
fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance.
Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain
both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the
1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial
layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and
retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local
retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the
most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our
proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of
LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and
improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without
sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks.
Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher
inference efficiency.

TL;DR: STIM-TM是一种针对手术视频理解的新型令牌合并方法，通过时空信息挖掘显著提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因处理大量时空令牌导致计算成本高，且未充分考虑视频数据的时空结构和信息分布异质性。

Method: 提出时空解耦策略，分别沿时间和空间维度合并令牌，保留关键信息。

Result: 在减少65%计算量的同时保持准确性，支持长序列视频高效训练。

Conclusion: STIM-TM为手术视频理解提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformer models have shown impressive effectiveness in the surgical
video understanding tasks through long-range dependency modeling. However,
current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing
massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames. While prior work on token
merging has advanced model efficiency, they fail to adequately consider the
inherent spatiotemporal structure of video data and overlook the heterogeneous
nature of information distribution, leading to suboptimal performance. In this
paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM)
method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video
understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token
redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically,
the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive
frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and
maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging
static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions
containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner,
STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\%$ GFLOPs reduction
while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video
tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical
videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.

Method: 提出Region Comprehension Index (RCI)，通过比较模型在图像局部和完整图像上的表现，量化数据集的依赖特性。

Result: 应用RCI分析13个多模态基准测试，发现多数依赖局部推理且存在空间偏差，可能影响实际应用。

Conclusion: RCI为研究人员提供了诊断和缓解数据集偏差的工具，有助于开发更鲁棒的多模态系统。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive results on
vision-language benchmarks, yet it remains unclear whether these benchmarks
assess genuine global reasoning or allow success via localized visual cues.
Existing evaluation methods do not explicitly measure this distinction,
hindering effective dataset curation and real-world focused model development.
  We introduce Region Comprehension Index (RCI), the first model-based score to
directly quantify a dataset's reliance on global versus local visual
information. RCI systematically compares reference-model performance on image
patches versus full images, revealing if tasks require holistic image
understanding or can be solved with partial or localized visual cues.
  When applying RCI to 13 widely used multimodal benchmarks, we observed that
most of them favor localized reasoning and exhibit significant spatial biases,
indicating potential risks in real-world applications. RCI equips researchers &
practitioners with an actionable tool for diagnosing & mitigating these biases,
enabling the construction of datasets and benchmarks to foster the development
of robust, enterprise-ready multimodal systems.

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，同时保持高计算效率和可扩展性。

Conclusion: MSD-KMamba有效解决了体积分割中的计算复杂性和全局感知不足问题。

Abstract: Numerous CNN-Transformer hybrid models rely on high-complexity global
attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies, which introduces
non-linear computational complexity and leads to significant resource
consumption. Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms
can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high
segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance
with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we
propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba,
which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale
self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures
long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also
incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further
enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In
addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens
hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic
information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the
bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled
fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of
quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while
simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception.
Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that
MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation
accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational
efficiency and favorable scalability. The source code of MSD-KMamba is publicly

Result: 在HunyuanVideo-13B上，QuantSparse达到20.88 PSNR，优于Q-VDiT（16.85 PSNR），存储减少3.68倍，推理加速1.88倍。

Conclusion: QuantSparse有效结合量化和稀疏化，显著提升性能并降低成本，为视频生成模型的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion transformers exhibit remarkable video generation capability, yet
their prohibitive computational and memory costs hinder practical deployment.
Model quantization and attention sparsification are two promising directions
for compression, but each alone suffers severe performance degradation under
aggressive compression. Combining them promises compounded efficiency gains,
but naive integration is ineffective. The sparsity-induced information loss
exacerbates quantization noise, leading to amplified attention shifts. To
address this, we propose \textbf{QuantSparse}, a unified framework that
integrates model quantization with attention sparsification. Specifically, we
introduce \textit{Multi-Scale Salient Attention Distillation}, which leverages
both global structural guidance and local salient supervision to mitigate
quantization-induced bias. In addition, we develop \textit{Second-Order Sparse
Attention Reparameterization}, which exploits the temporal stability of
second-order residuals to efficiently recover information lost under sparsity.
Experiments on HunyuanVideo-13B demonstrate that QuantSparse achieves 20.88
PSNR, substantially outperforming the state-of-the-art quantization baseline
Q-VDiT (16.85 PSNR), while simultaneously delivering a \textbf{3.68$\times$}

Motivation: 现有基准测试过于简化，仅使用文本描述或静态视角，无法准确评估智能体的能力，尤其是视觉语言模型在动态环境中的表现。

Method: 提出HomeSafeBench，包含12,900个数据点，覆盖五种常见家庭安全隐患，提供动态第一人称视角图像，支持智能体自由探索。

Result: 主流视觉语言模型在HomeSafeBench上表现不佳，最佳模型的F1分数仅为10.23%，尤其在识别安全隐患和探索策略上存在明显不足。

Conclusion: HomeSafeBench为未来家庭安全检查研究提供了重要参考，揭示了当前视觉语言模型的局限性。

Abstract: Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home
environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety
inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key
limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual
descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which
hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language
Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental
observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the
omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a
fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a
benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards:
fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench
provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home
environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety
inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room,
HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments
for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs
on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an
F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs.
The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting
effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable
reference and support for future research related to home security inspections.

Result: WBF方法使mAP达到0.838，比最佳单模型提升2.948%。

Conclusion: 置信度感知的融合策略是提升集成模型准确性的关键机制。

Abstract: The safety and security of public spaces is of vital importance, driving the
need for sophisticated surveillance systems capable of accurately detecting
weapons, which are often hampered by issues like partial occlusion, varying
lighting, and cluttered backgrounds. While single-model detectors are advanced,
they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents
the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with
diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection
robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models
were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50,
EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting
of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The
predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion
(WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy.
Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's
diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a
mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative
improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms
other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing
real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by
demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving
accuracy metrics of ensembles.

TL;DR: INSTINCT是一种新型协作感知框架，通过实例级交互减少带宽需求并提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决协作感知中LiDAR实现不足和性能落后的问题。

Method: 提出质量感知过滤、双分支检测路由和跨代理本地实例融合模块。

Result: 在DAIR-V2X和V2V4Real数据集上准确率提升13.23%/33.08%，带宽降至1/281和1/264。

Conclusion: INSTINCT显著提升协作感知性能并降低带宽需求。

Abstract: Collaborative perception systems overcome single-vehicle limitations in
long-range detection and occlusion scenarios by integrating multi-agent sensory
data, improving accuracy and safety. However, frequent cooperative interactions
and real-time requirements impose stringent bandwidth constraints. Previous
works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth
demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in
collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing
state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT
(INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception
framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering
mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch
detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and
collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion
module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance
the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse
hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets
demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance. Specifically, our
method achieves an improvement in accuracy 13.23%/33.08% in DAIR-V2X and
V2V4Real while reducing the communication bandwidth to 1/281 and 1/264 compared
to state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at

TL;DR: CrimEdit通过联合训练去除和插入任务嵌入，利用无分类器引导技术提升对象效果处理能力，实现高效复合编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在统一模型中应用无分类器引导处理对象效果（如阴影和反射）的性能影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出CrimEdit，联合训练去除和插入任务嵌入，并在无分类器引导方案中利用它们，支持空间区域应用以实现对象移动。

Result: 实验表明CrimEdit在对象去除、可控效果插入和高效对象移动方面表现优异。

Conclusion: CrimEdit通过统一模型和引导技术，显著提升了复合编辑的效率和效果。

Abstract: Recent works on object removal and insertion have enhanced their performance
by handling object effects such as shadows and reflections, using diffusion
models trained on counterfactual datasets. However, the performance impact of
applying classifier-free guidance to handle object effects across removal and
insertion tasks within a unified model remains largely unexplored. To address
this gap and improve efficiency in composite editing, we propose CrimEdit,
which jointly trains the task embeddings for removal and insertion within a
single model and leverages them in a classifier-free guidance scheme --
enhancing the removal of both objects and their effects, and enabling
controllable synthesis of object effects during insertion. CrimEdit also
extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions,
enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By
employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit
achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient
object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and
insertion stages.

<details>

Motivation: 帕金森病诊断流程复杂且依赖专家经验，导致早期检测延迟和干预机会的错失。

Method: 结合MRI预处理模块和两种临床先验知识（脑区相关性和脑区老化），设计了特征聚合和诊断模块。

Result: 在外部测试中达到86%的准确率，早期诊断准确率超过96%，优于现有方法20%以上。

Conclusion: PD-Diag-Net是一种高效、准确的帕金森病诊断工具，具有临床实用性和可解释性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that severely
diminishes patients' quality of life. Its global prevalence has increased
markedly in recent decades. Current diagnostic workflows are complex and
heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early
detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed
PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly
from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing
Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability
by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It
then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1)
Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions
strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior),
which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated
regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the
Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides
the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the
Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps
as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic
accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test
data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that
PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in
early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than
20%.

Result: 实验表明DiffPCN在几何精度和形状完整性上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DiffPCN显著提升了点云补全的鲁棒性和一致性。

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) have demonstrated remarkable generative
capabilities across various low-level vision tasks. However, their potential
for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and
irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel
diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our
approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point
clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point
denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and
irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as
conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view
depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our
DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by
leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then,
since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we
design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point
cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an
Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by
leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the
corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art
performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly
improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.

Conclusion: 该方法为长视频理解模型设定了新标准，且无需额外训练或参数调整。

Abstract: Recent Video-Language Models (VLMs) achieve promising results on long-video
understanding, but their performance still lags behind that achieved on tasks
involving images or short videos. This has led to great interest in improving
the long context modeling of VLMs by introducing novel modules and additional
complexity. % additional training time. In this paper, we take a different
approach: rather than fine-tuning VLMs with the limited data available, we
attempt to maximize the performance of existing models. To this end, we propose
a novel visual prompting strategy specifically designed for long-video
understanding. By combining multiple frames as panels into one image, we
effectively trade off spatial details for temporal resolution. Our approach is
training-free, parameter-free, and model-agnostic, and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing VLMs. Extensive experiments on five established
benchmarks across a wide range of model architectures, sizes, and context
windows confirm the consistency of our approach. For the TimeScope (Long)
dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question
answering is improved by up to 19.4\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for
long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon
acceptance.

Result: 实验表明，M3DLayout能有效训练布局生成模型，尤其是Inf3DLayout子集支持生成更复杂的场景。

Conclusion: M3DLayout为文本驱动的3D场景合成研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: In text-driven 3D scene generation, object layout serves as a crucial
intermediate representation that bridges high-level language instructions with
detailed geometric output. It not only provides a structural blueprint for
ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and
interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor
layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and
annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce
M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation.
M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating
three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and
procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured
text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large
furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and
richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic
patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential
of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion
model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid
foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition
enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich
small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed
scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing
research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但部署时对内存和计算资源需求高。虽然后训练量化（PTQ）在语言模型中已成功应用，但其在多模态模型中的效果尚未充分探索。

Method: 论文提出LUQ策略，通过分析多模态令牌的统计特性，选择性地对更耐受量化的层应用超低比特量化，并利用混合模态令牌提升性能。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5和Qwen-2.5-VL模型上，LUQ减少了40%和31%的内存占用，性能损失小于10%。

Conclusion: LUQ为多模态大语言模型的超低比特量化提供了有效解决方案，显著降低了资源需求，同时保持了模型性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized
vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and
computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has
successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without
significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs)
remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on
ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them
exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text
tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the
activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over
different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation
distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better
tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a
novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit
Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers
that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of
multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the
ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL
across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less
memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a
performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单尺度表示建模的固有局限性，提升视觉生成任务的性能。

Method: 采用多尺度下采样和尺度因果注意力机制，生成多尺度token序列。

Result: 在相同设置下，多尺度Tokenizer比单尺度性能提升27.2%（rFID），下游生成任务收敛速度提升1.38倍，gFID提升18.9%。

Conclusion: HieraTok是首个多尺度ViT-based Tokenizer，为视觉生成任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer
(ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling
single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1)
multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer
encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal
attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from
low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details.
Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both
image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the
multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a
27.2\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into
downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\times$ faster convergence
rate and an 18.9\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \rightarrow 13.3$), which may be
attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space.
Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its
potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To
the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based
tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings
and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.

Conclusion: ResAD++通过残差特征和超球约束有效解决了特征相关性问题，显著提升了类无关异常检测的性能。

Abstract: This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD),
where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize
to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any
retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the
performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still
unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in
existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To
address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but
effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual
feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual
features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features.
In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new
classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably
shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual
features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a
feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial
normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature
scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose
a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization
based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the
improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight
real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD
results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art
competing methods and also surpassing ResAD. The code is available at

Result: Poivre-7B在Point-Bench上超越Gemini-2.5-Pro和Molmo-72B等模型。

Conclusion: Poivre方法有效提升视觉指向任务性能，为未来研究提供资源支持。

Abstract: Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its
coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of
vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent
benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on
this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the
pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object
without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple
yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre).
This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then
iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of
reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement
learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training,
we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also
grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new
state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as
Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%. To
support future research, we release our training and inference code, dataset,
and the Poivre-7B checkpoint.

Abstract: Colorectal cancer ranks among the most common and deadly cancers, emphasizing
the need for effective early detection and treatment. To address the
limitations of traditional colonoscopy, including high miss rates due to polyp
variability, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer Adapter Residual
Network (PVTAdpNet). This model integrates a U-Net-style encoder-decoder
structure with a Pyramid Vision Transformer backbone, novel residual blocks,
and adapter-based skip connections. The design enhances feature extraction,
dense prediction, and gradient flow, supported by squeeze-and-excitation
attention for improved channel-wise feature refinement. PVTAdpNet achieves
real-time, accurate polyp segmentation, demonstrating superior performance on
benchmark datasets with high mDice and mIoU scores, making it highly suitable
for clinical applications. PVTAdpNet obtains a high Dice coefficient of 0.8851
and a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 0.8167 on out-of-distribution
polyp datasets. Evaluation of the PolypGen dataset demonstrates PVTAdpNet's

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion models in text-to-image generation has
sparked growing interest in expanding their capabilities to a variety of
multi-modal tasks, including image understanding, manipulation, and perception.
These tasks require advanced semantic comprehension across both visual and
textual modalities, especially in scenarios involving complex semantic
instructions. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on
vision-language models (VLMs) or modular designs for semantic guidance, leading
to fragmented architectures and computational inefficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose UniAlignment, a unified multimodal generation framework
within a single diffusion transformer. UniAlignment introduces a dual-stream
diffusion training strategy that incorporates both intrinsic-modal semantic
alignment and cross-modal semantic alignment, thereby enhancing the model's
cross-modal consistency and instruction-following robustness. Additionally, we
present SemGen-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate
multimodal semantic consistency under complex textual instructions. Extensive
experiments across multiple tasks and benchmarks demonstrate that UniAlignment
outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the significant potential of
diffusion models in unified multimodal generation.

Conclusion: GenView++ 通过改进正样本对的构建和学习机制，显著提升了对比学习在视觉和视觉语言任务中的性能。

Abstract: The success of contrastive learning depends on the construction and
utilization of high-quality positive pairs. However, current methods face
critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted
and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk
semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment
mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally.
To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that
addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve
pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation
mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically
modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned,
and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive
learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to
dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality
pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and
vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2
by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it
raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and
+5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text
retrieval R@5 by +3.2%. The code is available at

They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all
modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and
characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial
heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities
remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To
address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling
framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset
comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element,
remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into
two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level
and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a
mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed
by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific
characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed
to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective
region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware
multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific
modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR
further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region
aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region
representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities
and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.

*Qifan Li,Jiale Zou,Jinhua Zhang,Wei Long,Xinyu Zhou,Shuhang Gu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种纹理向量量化和重建感知预测策略，以解决现有VQ方法在视觉先验建模中的量化误差和预测精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQ方法在编码视觉特征时存在较大的量化误差，且训练预测器时无法考虑最终重建误差，导致先验建模精度不足。

Method: 采用纹理向量量化策略，仅对缺失纹理建模；引入重建感知预测策略，通过直通估计器直接训练索引预测器。

Result: 提出的TVQ&RAP模型能以较低计算成本生成逼真的超分辨率图像。

Conclusion: TVQ&RAP方法有效提升了视觉先验建模的精度和效率。

Abstract: Vector-quantized based models have recently demonstrated strong potential for
visual prior modeling. However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual
features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level
supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to
large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level
supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration,
result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the
above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction
Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages
the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the
prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy
makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor
with image-level supervision. Our proposed generative SR model (TVQ&RAP) is
able to deliver photo-realistic SR results with small computational cost.

TL;DR: GroupCoOp是一种高效的参数微调方法，通过使用组特定文本提示增强视觉语言模型的群体鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型微调中因子群不平衡导致的虚假相关性问题。

Method: 采用组特定文本提示作为组代表，利用VLM的文本编码器发现有效的组提示。

Result: 在五个基准测试中表现最佳，偶尔优于全网络微调方法，仅训练0.016%的参数。

Conclusion: GroupCoOp通过组提示有效解决了微调数据集中的子群不平衡问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of vision-language models (VLMs)
excels in various vision tasks thanks to the rich knowledge and generalization
ability of VLMs. However, recent studies revealed that such fine-tuned VLMs are
vulnerable to spurious correlations stemming from the subgroup imbalance in the
fine-tuning datasets. To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context
Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm
that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to
employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple
classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text
encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups
with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each
class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as
the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in
the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks
across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that
fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\% of the network's
parameters.

Conclusion: 尽管针对《愤怒的小鸟》，但该方法可推广至类似结构的2D游戏。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) techniques enable automatic creation of
diverse and complex environments. While PCG facilitates more efficient content
creation, ensuring consistently high-quality, industry-standard content remains
a significant challenge. In this research, we propose a method to identify and
repair unstable levels generated by existing PCG models. We use Angry Birds as
a case study, demonstrating our method on game levels produced by established
PCG approaches. Our method leverages object segmentation and visual analysis of
level images to detect structural gaps and perform targeted repairs. We
evaluate multiple object segmentation models and select the most effective one
as the basis for our repair pipeline. Experimental results show that our method
improves the stability and playability of AI-generated levels. Although our
evaluation is specific to Angry Birds, our image-based approach is designed to
be applicable to a wide range of 2D games with similar level structures.

Abstract: Urban modeling is essential for city planning, scene synthesis, and gaming.
Existing image-based methods generate diverse layouts but often lack geometric
continuity and scalability, while graph-based methods capture structural
relations yet overlook parcel semantics. We present a controllable framework
for large-scale 3D vector urban layout generation, conditioned on both geometry
and semantics. By fusing geometric and semantic attributes, introducing edge
weights, and embedding building height in the graph, our method extends 2D
layouts to realistic 3D structures. It also enables users to directly control
the output by modifying semantic attributes. Experiments show that it produces
valid, large-scale urban models, offering an effective tool for data-driven
planning and design.

Abstract: Quality control is a critical aspect of manufacturing, particularly in
ensuring the proper assembly of small components in production lines. Existing
solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are
prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting
inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional
inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to
increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality
control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera
imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images
from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of
components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines
results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing
detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset
comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting
conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world
manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach
significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and
recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts
such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming
single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate
quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the
assembly line. The dataset used in this study is publicly available to
facilitate further research in this domain.

Result: 发现现有模型在隐私理解上存在不一致性，突显了构建更隐私敏感的AI系统的紧迫性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来隐私研究提供了分类法基础，并揭示了当前模型的局限性，呼吁开发更强大的隐私感知AI。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence have profoundly transformed the technological
landscape in recent years. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern
recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these
advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in
the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial
interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce
privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test
such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal
frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this
end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that
captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable
to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the
capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual
privacy. Our work contributes both a foundational taxonomy for future research
and a critical benchmark of current model limitations, demonstrating the urgent
need for more robust, privacy-aware AI systems.

TL;DR: Uni4D-LLM是首个统一4D场景理解和生成的视觉语言模型框架，通过共享表示和架构实现时空感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D和4D场景中无法统一理解和生成任务，尤其是在动态4D场景中。

Method: 提出共享表示（语义和外观特征）和共享架构（基于Transformer的LLM），并通过指令微调提升泛化能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，首次实现了4D场景理解和生成的统一。

Conclusion: Uni4D-LLM为4D场景任务提供了统一的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D
scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the
physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches
typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic
understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap
prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic
4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM,
the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene
understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1)
Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for
understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation,
incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual
representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a
shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer
backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific
heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM
produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one
Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on
diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM
achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models
and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.

Motivation: 解决传统方法因依赖外观匹配而对视觉变化、遮挡等挑战鲁棒性不足的问题。

Result: 在MOSEv2测试集上零样本性能达39.7 JFn，排名第二。

Conclusion: SeC框架通过语义理解显著提升了视频目标分割的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised Video Object Segmentation aims to segment a specified target
throughout a video sequence, initialized by a first-frame mask. Previous
methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit
limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes,
occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of
high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed
Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large
Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the
object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its
zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2
(MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved
39.7 \JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the
7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.

Motivation: 现有文本到3D生成模型的质量评估方法存在基准过时、指标设计不足等问题，限制了其可靠性和实用性。

Method: 通过定义五个组件和十二个子组件生成3,600个纹理网格，并收集129,600个人类评分。提出Rank2Score评估器，采用两阶段训练方法。

Result: Rank2Score在多个维度上优于现有指标，并能作为奖励函数优化生成模型。

Conclusion: T23D-CompBench和Rank2Score为文本到3D生成模型的质量评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the
synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However,
existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality
assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and
coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover,
current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in
non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To
address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive
benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with
twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate
3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A
large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable
human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we
further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for
T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive
regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines
predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human
judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream
applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing
metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward
function to optimize generative models. The project is available at

Method: 使用分支网络共享激活图，模仿视觉语言模型的嵌入，预测概念并通过梯度加权激活图表示区域，量化其贡献。

Result: CE-FAM在定性和定量评估中优于现有方法，且在零样本推理中表现优异。

Conclusion: CE-FAM为识别概念区域及其贡献提供了通用框架，无需标注数据集，且能处理任意概念。

Abstract: Although saliency maps can highlight important regions to explain the
reasoning behind image classification in artificial intelligence (AI), the
meaning of these regions is left to the user's interpretation. In contrast,
conceptbased explanations decompose AI predictions into humanunderstandable
concepts, clarifying their contributions. However, few methods can
simultaneously reveal what concepts an image classifier learns, which regions
are associated with them, and how they contribute to predictions. We propose a
novel concept-based explanation method, Concept-based Explanation via Fusion of
Activation Maps (CE-FAM). It employs a branched network that shares activation
maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision
and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and
their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation
maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores.
Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image
classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying
the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to
handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset. Furthermore,
we introduce a novel evaluation metric to assess the accuracy of the concept
regions. Our qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate our method
outperforms existing approaches and excels in zero-shot inference for unseen
concepts.

Motivation: 现有面部美观预测模型存在架构限制、人口统计偏见和缺乏透明度的问题，FairViT-GAN旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 结合CNN分支提取局部特征和ViT分支建模全局上下文，并引入对抗性去偏机制以减少算法偏见。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，FairViT-GAN的Pearson相关系数为0.9230，RMSE降至0.2650，公平性显著提升，性能差距减少82.9%。

Conclusion: FairViT-GAN为开发负责任的主观视觉评估AI系统提供了强大、透明且公平的蓝图。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) has made significant strides with the
application of deep learning, yet state-of-the-art models often exhibit
critical limitations, including architectural constraints, inherent demographic
biases, and a lack of transparency. Existing methods, primarily based on
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but
struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs)
effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details.
Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and
perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To
address these interconnected challenges, we propose \textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a
novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local
feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More
significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the
feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are
invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic
bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct
focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500
benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in
predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \textbf{0.9230} and
reducing RMSE to \textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness. Our analysis
reveals a remarkable \textbf{82.9\% reduction in the performance gap} between
ethnic subgroups, with the adversary's classification accuracy dropping to
near-random chance (52.1\%). We believe FairViT-GAN provides a robust,
transparent, and significantly fairer blueprint for developing responsible AI
systems for subjective visual assessment.

Result: 实验证明Sim-DETR显著提升了DETR在时间句子定位任务中的表现。

Conclusion: Sim-DETR为时间句子定位任务提供了一个强大的基线模型。

Abstract: Temporal sentence grounding aims to identify exact moments in a video that
correspond to a given textual query, typically addressed with detection
transformer (DETR) solutions. However, we find that typical strategies designed
to enhance DETR do not improve, and may even degrade, its performance in this
task. We systematically analyze and identify the root causes of this abnormal
behavior: (1) conflicts between queries from similar target moments and (2)
internal query conflicts due to the tension between global semantics and local
localization. Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful
baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor
modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between
queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding
query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts. Experiments
demonstrate that Sim-DETR unlocks the full potential of DETR for temporal
sentence grounding, offering a strong baseline for future research.

Conclusion: IGG为自回归模型设定了新的基准，显著提升了生成图像的质量和语义一致性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models based on next-scale prediction are rapidly
emerging as a powerful tool for image generation, but they face a critical
weakness: information inconsistencies between patches across timesteps
introduced by progressive resolution scaling. These inconsistencies scatter
guidance signals, causing them to drift away from conditioning information and
leaving behind ambiguous, unfaithful features. We tackle this challenge with
Information-Grounding Guidance (IGG), a novel mechanism that anchors guidance
to semantically important regions through attention. By adaptively reinforcing
informative patches during sampling, IGG ensures that guidance and content
remain tightly aligned. Across both class-conditioned and text-to-image
generation tasks, IGG delivers sharper, more coherent, and semantically
grounded images, setting a new benchmark for AR-based methods.

Abstract: The reliability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world
settings is often undermined by sensitivity to irrelevant or distracting visual
context, an aspect not captured by existing evaluation metrics. We introduce
the \textbf{Patch Context Robustness Index (PCRI)}, the first systematic and
interpretable score for quantifying MLLM robustness to variations in visual
context granularity, measuring performance changes between localized image
patches and full-image input.
  Applying PCRI to 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs across 15 vision-language
benchmarks, we find that most leading models remain brittle to background
noise, with only a few, such as InternVL2-26B and Qwen2VL-72B, demonstrating
consistent robustness across tasks. PCRI analysis also highlights how different
model architectures handle and integrate visual context, offering actionable
diagnostic insight for both researchers and practitioners.
  PCRI enables rigorous comparison of context robustness, supporting principled
model selection and guiding the development of future architectures and
training strategies for robust, real-world deployment.

Abstract: Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D
annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based
teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main
challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from
the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels
by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works
tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of
pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object
distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the
pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In
this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable
pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select
high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher
output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by
the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are
supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes.
Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly
under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner
labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on
the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The
proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider
coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant
SS3DOD methods.

### [175] [Tunable-Generalization Diffusion Powered by Self-Supervised Contextual Sub-Data for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23885)
*Guoquan Wei,Zekun Zhou,Liu Shi,Wenzhe Shan,Qiegen Liu*

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SuperDiff的自监督上下文子数据驱动的可调泛化扩散方法，用于低剂量CT重建，显著提升了重建和泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖配对数据且泛化能力差，扩散模型需学习干净数据分布，难以满足临床应用需求。自监督方法在剂量扩展时泛化性显著下降。

Method: 设计了上下文子数据相似性自适应感知策略，结合知识蒸馏和潜在扩散模型优化图像细节，提出像素级自校正融合技术增强图像保真度。

Result: 在数据集和真实数据上的定性和定量评估表明，SuperDiff在重建和泛化性能上均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SuperDiff仅需低剂量CT投影域数据进行训练和测试，实现了高效且灵活的重建和泛化。

Abstract: Current models based on deep learning for low-dose CT denoising rely heavily
on paired data and generalize poorly. Even the more concerned diffusion models
need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is
difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time,
self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of
generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other
doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of
tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data
for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata
similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the
LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent
progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge
distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing
image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and
the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained
reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the
initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is
flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen
doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising,
SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing.
Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data
show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods
in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.

TL;DR: AssemblyHands-X是首个无标记的3D手-身体基准数据集，用于研究双手活动中手-身体协调对动作识别的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集缺乏对手和身体协调运动的系统评估，且标记方法存在局限性。

Method: 通过多视角三角测量和SMPL-X网格拟合构建3D姿态标注流程，验证不同输入表示对动作识别模型的影响。

Result: 实验表明，基于姿态的动作推断比视频基线更高效准确，且联合建模手和身体线索优于单独使用手或身体。

Conclusion: 手-身体协调建模对双手活动的整体理解至关重要。

Abstract: Bimanual human activities inherently involve coordinated movements of both
hands and body. However, the impact of this coordination in activity
understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable
datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose)
for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate
either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion
capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual
artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless
videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first
markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study
the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by
constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view
videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh
fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then
validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or
hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph
convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that
pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video
baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action
recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance
of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of
bimanual activities.

TL;DR: 提出了一种跨模态对比遗忘（CCU）框架，用于解决视觉模态隐私泄露问题，同时保留跨模态知识和类内结构稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉模态在多模态应用中易受隐私泄露影响，现有方法在视觉遗忘时会损害跨模态知识和类内结构稳定性。

Method: CCU框架包含选择性视觉遗忘、跨模态知识保留和双集对比分离三个关键组件。

Result: 在三个数据集上，CCU相比基线方法提升了7.12%的准确率，且仅需7%的遗忘时间。

Conclusion: CCU有效解决了视觉遗忘中的隐私问题，同时保持了模型性能和其他模态的判别能力。

Abstract: Visual modality is the most vulnerable to privacy leakage in real-world
multimodal applications like autonomous driving with visual and radar data;
Machine unlearning removes specific training data from pre-trained models to
address privacy leakage, however, existing methods fail to preserve cross-modal
knowledge and maintain intra-class structural stability of retain data, leading
to reduced overall and other modalities' performance during visual unlearning;
to address these challenges, we propose a Cross-modal Contrastive Unlearning
(CCU) framework, which integrates three key components: (a) selective visual
unlearning: employing inverse contrastive learning to dissociate visual
representations from their original semantics, (b) cross-modal knowledge
retention: preserving other modalities' discriminability through semantic
consistency, and (c) dual-set contrastive separation: preserving the model
performance via isolation of structural perturbations between the unlearn set
and retain set; extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate the
superiority of CCU, and our method achieves a 7.12% accuracy improvement with
only 7% of the unlearning time compared to the top-accuracy baseline.

Motivation: 解决医疗AI中需要同时理解图像和文本的复杂临床问题。

Conclusion: 该方法为医生提供了智能、清晰且实用的AI工具。

Abstract: Solving tough clinical questions that require both image and text
understanding is still a major challenge in healthcare AI. In this work, we
propose Q-FSRU, a new model that combines Frequency Spectrum Representation and
Fusion (FSRU) with a method called Quantum Retrieval-Augmented Generation
(Quantum RAG) for medical Visual Question Answering (VQA). The model takes in
features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the
frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on
more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To
improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a
quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from
external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are
then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We
evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology
images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier
models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of
frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability.
Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and
helpful AI tools for doctors.

Method: 使用紧凑的Vision Transformer架构，结合类别条件扩散重放和弹性权重巩固。

Result: 在CheXpert上达到0.851 AUROC，遗忘率降低30%以上，接近联合训练的0.869 AUROC。

Conclusion: 该方法为临床影像模型的隐私保护和持续适应提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Medical imaging foundation models must adapt over time, yet full retraining
is often blocked by privacy constraints and cost. We present a continual
learning framework that avoids storing patient exemplars by pairing class
conditional diffusion replay with Elastic Weight Consolidation. Using a compact
Vision Transformer backbone, we evaluate across eight MedMNIST v2 tasks and
CheXpert. On CheXpert our approach attains 0.851 AUROC, reduces forgetting by
more than 30\% relative to DER\texttt{++}, and approaches joint training at
0.869 AUROC, while remaining efficient and privacy preserving. Analyses connect
forgetting to two measurable factors: fidelity of replay and Fisher weighted
parameter drift, highlighting the complementary roles of replay diffusion and
synaptic stability. The results indicate a practical route for scalable,

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦域适应（FedDA）分割训练框架，通过特征级对抗学习解决医疗图像模态异构性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗资源不平衡和数据损坏导致不同客户端拥有不同模态的医疗图像，这对联邦学习中的跨域医学图像分割提出了挑战。

Method: 通过嵌入对抗训练机制，在客户端之间对齐特征图，实现特征级对抗学习。

Result: 在三个医学图像数据集上的实验表明，FedDA显著实现了跨域联邦聚合，并提升了单模态客户端的跨模态处理能力。

Conclusion: FedDA在客观和主观评估中均表现出优于现有联邦聚合算法的鲁棒性能。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative training of machine learning models
among different clients while ensuring data privacy, emerging as the mainstream
for breaking data silos in the healthcare domain. However, the imbalance of
medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a
situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality.
This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image
segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this
challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation
training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial
learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through
embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the
model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact
from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets
demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain
federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality
processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared
to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and
subjective assessment. Our code are available at

Result: EditScore在基准测试中超越GPT-5，并成功应用于OmniGen2模型，显著提升了性能。

Conclusion: 研究表明，高保真、领域专用的奖励模型是释放强化学习在图像编辑中潜力的关键，为从基准测试到奖励建模再到强化学习训练提供了系统路径。

Abstract: Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet
current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often
require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been
severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In
this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier,
centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We
first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically
evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we
develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the
quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation
and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning
proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy
tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even
surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity
reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our
experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide
an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy
optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results
in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift.
Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to
reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity,
domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of
RL in this domain.

Conclusion: MoReact在双人互动反应生成任务中表现出色，为计算机视觉和人机交互提供了新思路。

Abstract: Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with
broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing
methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly
generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the
other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that
underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive
responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic
interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach
tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on
text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates
realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's
actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to
produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but
also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present
MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of
global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from
the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for
guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of
generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a
two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this
novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable
reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also
adhere to the textual guidance. Please find our webpage at

Result: 基于梯度范数的损失缩放策略能高效解决优化不平衡，性能接近网格搜索。

Conclusion: 控制梯度动态比开发复杂方法更直接有效，为MTL研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to build general-purpose vision systems by
training a single network to perform multiple tasks jointly. While promising,
its potential is often hindered by "unbalanced optimization", where task
interference leads to subpar performance compared to single-task models. To
facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental
analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our
investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods
varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on
costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful
Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not
inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data
quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis:
a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of
task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly
applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses
according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of
an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive
analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a
more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.

Result: MT-AdvCLIP在多个任务上平均攻击成功率提升39%。

Conclusion: 揭示了多任务CLIP模型中对抗样本的迁移机制，为多任务鲁棒性评估和对抗样本设计提供新思路。

Abstract: As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates
strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely
adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text
retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object
detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on
these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored.
Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to
assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we
conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of
CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic
segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples
generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic
segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from
coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP
model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task
Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature
aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task
generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of
fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on
multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the
adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across
multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models,
without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer
mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new
insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.

Conclusion: Token Painter通过创新的信息融合和注意力增强机制，显著提升了文本引导图像修复的性能和视觉效果。

Abstract: Text-guided image inpainting aims to inpaint masked image regions based on a
textual prompt while preserving the background. Although diffusion-based
methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in
latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt
details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we
explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports
image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions,
enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However,
directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore
the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis
of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of
background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this
to design \textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting
method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1)
Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and
context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce
novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting
content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder
Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on
guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of
prompt details and the content visual quality. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our training-free method outperforms prior state-of-the-art
methods across almost all metrics and delivers superior visual results. Codes
will be released.

Abstract: Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as
directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept
has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a
given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation
by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients.
Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions.
A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector
we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not
directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep
networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder
directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess
concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by
unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder,
or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose
a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional
clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal
vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through
a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable
directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic
data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data,
decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform
unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding
directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate
applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual
predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.

Abstract: Cross-modal artificial intelligence has garnered widespread attention in
recent years, achieving significant progress in the study of natural images.
However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a
significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with
its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in
remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes
SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with
reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces
the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into
remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR
dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple
satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured
text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT),
providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of
landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships.
(3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that
continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed
loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable
multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11
representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons
against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading
performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We
expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model
architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly
advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.

TL;DR: AutoPrune是一种无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过自适应剪枝策略显著降低视觉语言模型的计算需求，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法采用固定策略，无法适应不同输入和任务的复杂性，而人类视觉处理过程启发了一种更灵活的剪枝方式。

Method: AutoPrune通过量化视觉和文本令牌的互信息，生成与任务复杂性匹配的剪枝策略，确保计算约束。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上，剪枝89%视觉令牌，减少76.8%计算量，保持96.7%精度，优于PDrop 9.1%。

Conclusion: AutoPrune展示了自适应剪枝在视觉语言模型中的高效性和灵活性。

Abstract: The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language
models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational
demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning
strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across
decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to
all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the
model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human
visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence
before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal
an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a
fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally
accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a
training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying
sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual
information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a
budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined
by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks
and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We
evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on
Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to
LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference
FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all
tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop,
demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3D-GS）的自动汽车损伤检测方法，通过单视图分割实现高效损伤检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多基于2D图像分析，缺乏3D几何信息，而3D重建方法能提供更全面的损伤表征。

Method: 通过2D掩码提升进行3D损伤分割，并提出一种无需学习的单视图3D-GS分割方法，利用SfM获取相机参数。

Result: 该方法在单视图下表现优异，尤其适用于损伤仅在单一视角清晰可见的情况。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在汽车损伤检测中具有高效性和实用性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for
the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective
damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to
leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more
comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage.
Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis,
particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to
generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of
views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline
that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we
propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS
segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using
camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then
filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal
distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that
this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage
detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be
clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches
impractical or impossible. The code is publicly available at:

Conclusion: ColLab为REC和REG提供了一种高效、自动化的数据生成框架，并被应用于ICCV 2025 MARS2挑战赛的数据生成流程。

Abstract: Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) and Referring Expression Generation
(REG) are fundamental tasks in multimodal understanding, supporting precise
object localization through natural language. However, existing REC and REG
datasets rely heavily on manual annotation, which is labor-intensive and
difficult to scale. In this paper, we propose ColLab, a collaborative spatial
progressive data engine that enables fully automated REC and REG data
generation without human supervision. Specifically, our method introduces a
Collaborative Multimodal Model Interaction (CMMI) strategy, which leverages the
semantic understanding of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and large
language models (LLMs) to generate descriptions. Furthermore, we design a
module termed Spatial Progressive Augmentation (SPA) to enhance spatial
expressiveness among duplicate instances. Experiments demonstrate that ColLab
significantly accelerates the annotation process of REC and REG while improving
the quality and discriminability of the generated expressions. In addition to
the core methodological contribution, our framework was partially adopted in
the data generation pipeline of the ICCV 2025 MARS2 Challenge on Multimodal
Reasoning, enriching the dataset with diverse and challenging samples that
better reflect real-world reasoning demands.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频世界模型在准确建模人类指定动作方面能力不足，且强化学习方法因高成本和不切实际的视频验证器而难以应用。

Method: 提出RLIR框架，利用逆向动力学模型从视频中恢复动作，提供可验证的奖励信号，通过组相对策略优化进行优化。

Result: 实验显示，RLIR在动作跟随能力上提升5-10%，视觉质量提升10%，并获得更高的人类偏好评分。

Conclusion: RLIR是首个专门设计用于提升视频世界模型动作跟随能力的后训练方法。

Abstract: World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with
diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual
quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of
accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored.
Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the
suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an
appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement
learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the
prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of
constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose
Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework
that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from
generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional
video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective
and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization.
Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10%
gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher
human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method
specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.

Conclusion: 该方法在甲状腺超声分类中表现优异，具有强泛化能力和临床实用性。

Abstract: Timely and accurate diagnosis is crucial in addressing the global rise in
thyroid cancer, ensuring effective treatment strategies and improved patient
outcomes. We present an intelligent classification method that couples an
Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau
(CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll
chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public
DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign)
using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17%
accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC
of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7
improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from
89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained
state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S
(96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983),
and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by
+1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally
efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further
supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an
ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy
97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically
relevant regions. Altogether, the wavelet-chaos-CNN pipeline delivers
state-of-the-art thyroid ultrasound classification with strong generalization
and practical runtime characteristics suitable for clinical integration.

TL;DR: VFSI通过能量引导在扩散采样中强制物理约束，显著提升交通仿真的物理有效性和真实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型生成的交通仿真常违反物理约束，如车辆碰撞或驶离道路，需解决这一问题。

Method: 提出VFSI方法，通过能量函数（如碰撞避免和运动学约束）在扩散采样中引导生成有效轨迹。

Result: 在Waymo数据集上，VFSI将碰撞率降低67%，整体有效性提升87%，同时提高真实性。

Conclusion: 显式约束在推理阶段是确保物理有效交通仿真的必要且充分条件。

Abstract: Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but
systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of
SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of
generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive
off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation:
current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an
architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence
(VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during
diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision
avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising
process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from
the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to
8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while
simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our
model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement
during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic
simulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接应用生成扩散模型到视频超分辨率会导致冗余计算和学习负担，因为低质量视频已包含大量内容信息。

Method: 提出注意力专业化路由，根据注意力头的固有行为分配不同模式，并采用渐进训练策略从时间一致的退化开始学习。

Result: OASIS在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，推理速度比基线快6.2倍。

Conclusion: OASIS通过减少冗余和优化训练策略，有效提升了视频超分辨率的效率和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video
super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models
to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve
substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased
computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous
operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this
problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model
with $\textbf{a}$ttention $\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world
v$\textbf{i}$deo $\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention
specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns
according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while
effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to
better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a
simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with
temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings.
This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on
both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference
speed, offering a $\textbf{6.2$\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion
baselines such as SeedVR2. The code will be available at

Conclusion: RPG360在无需训练的情况下实现了鲁棒的360度深度估计，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing use of 360 images across various domains has emphasized the
need for robust depth estimation techniques tailored for omnidirectional
images. However, obtaining large-scale labeled datasets for 360 depth
estimation remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose RPG360, a
training-free robust 360 monocular depth estimation method that leverages
perspective foundation models and graph optimization. Our approach converts 360
images into six-face cubemap representations, where a perspective foundation
model is employed to estimate depth and surface normals. To address depth scale
inconsistencies across different faces of the cubemap, we introduce a novel
depth scale alignment technique using graph-based optimization, which
parameterizes the predicted depth and normal maps while incorporating an
additional per-face scale parameter. This optimization ensures depth scale
consistency across the six-face cubemap while preserving 3D structural
integrity. Furthermore, as foundation models exhibit inherent robustness in
zero-shot settings, our method achieves superior performance across diverse
datasets, including Matterport3D, Stanford2D3D, and 360Loc. We also demonstrate
the versatility of our depth estimation approach by validating its benefits in
downstream tasks such as feature matching 3.2 ~ 5.4% and Structure from Motion
0.2 ~ 9.7% in AUC@5.

Abstract: Coronary angiography remains the gold standard for diagnosing Acute Coronary

patients to procedural risks and diagnostic delays, leading to postponed

modalities, including echocardiography videos and structured clinical records.
TREAT-Net integrates tabular-guided cross-attention to enhance video
interpretation, along with a late fusion mechanism to align predictions across
modalities. Trained on a dataset of over 9000 ACS cases, the model outperforms
unimodal and non-fused baselines, achieving a balanced accuracy of 67.6% and an
AUROC of 71.1%. Cross-modality agreement analysis demonstrates 88.6% accuracy
for intervention prediction. These findings highlight the potential of
TREAT-Net as a non-invasive tool for timely and accurate patient triage,
particularly in underserved populations with limited access to coronary
angiography.

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D head avatars from a single image is challenging,

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解模型采用固定帧采样策略，无法根据问题需求自适应地收集视觉证据，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出FrameMind框架，结合Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought (FiCOT)和Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS)技术，动态采样视觉信息。

Result: 在MLVU和VideoMME等基准测试中显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: FrameMind通过动态视觉信息请求和强化学习优化，实现了更灵活高效的视频理解。

Abstract: Current video understanding models rely on fixed frame sampling strategies,
processing predetermined visual inputs regardless of the specific reasoning
requirements of each question. This static approach limits their ability to
adaptively gather visual evidence, leading to suboptimal performance on tasks
that require either broad temporal coverage or fine-grained spatial detail. In
this paper, we introduce FrameMind, an end-to-end framework trained with
reinforcement learning that enables models to dynamically request visual
information during reasoning through Frame-Interleaved Chain-of-Thought
(FiCOT). Unlike traditional approaches, FrameMind operates in multiple turns
where the model alternates between textual reasoning and active visual
perception, using tools to extract targeted frames or video clips based on
identified knowledge gaps. To train effective dynamic sampling policies, we
propose Dynamic Resolution Frame Sampling (DRFS), which exposes models to
diverse temporal-spatial trade-offs during learning, and DRFS-GRPO, a
group-relative policy optimization algorithm that learns from outcome-based
rewards without requiring frame-level annotations. Extensive experiments on
challenging benchmarks like MLVU and VideoMME demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing models, advancing the state of the art in
flexible and efficient video understanding.

Motivation: 现有GCD方法主要针对RGB图像，无法有效处理高维且具有复杂光谱结构的HSI数据。

Abstract: Generalized category discovery~(GCD) seeks to jointly identify both known and
novel categories in unlabeled data. While prior works have mainly focused on
RGB images, their assumptions and modeling strategies do not generalize well to
hyperspectral images~(HSI), which are inherently high-dimensional and exhibit
complex spectral structures. In this paper, we propose the first GCD framework
tailored for HSI, introducing a prototype subspace modeling model to better
capture class structure. Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each
category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a
set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater
expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide
the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis
orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a
reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively
reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world
HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD
methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in
hyperspectral settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大气散射物理先验和行人关系拓扑建模的深度学习模型，用于雾天行人轨迹预测，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决雾天条件下行人轨迹预测中物理信息退化和行人交互建模无效的问题。

Method: 1. 构建可微分大气散射模型，解耦雾浓度与光退化；2. 设计自适应扫描状态空间模型；3. 开发异构图注意力网络建模行人关系。

Result: 在浓雾场景下（能见度<30m），minADE/minFDE指标分别降低37.2%和41.5%，推理速度提升78%。

Conclusion: 为恶劣环境下的智能交通系统提供了一种新的可靠感知建模范式。

Abstract: To address the issues of physical information degradation and ineffective
pedestrian interaction modeling in pedestrian trajectory prediction under hazy
weather conditions, we propose a deep learning model that combines physical
priors of atmospheric scattering with topological modeling of pedestrian
relationships. Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric
scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation
through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of
haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning
state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a
78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range
dependency modeling.
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a
heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model
multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a
spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns
of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian
trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE /
minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in
dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for
reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出直接在原始Bayer数据上学习图像重建，优于传统基于sRGB的方法，并引入新指标ICS。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于sRGB的图像重建会丢失原始数据信息，如颜色混合、动态范围裁剪和细节模糊。

Method: 通过评估Bayer和sRGB重建流程，创建Raw-Rain数据集，并引入ICS指标。

Result: 原始Bayer模型在PSNR和ICS上分别提升0.99 dB和1.2%，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 支持ISP后置范式，为端到端可学习相机管线开辟新方向。

Abstract: Image reconstruction from corrupted images is crucial across many domains.
Most reconstruction networks are trained on post-ISP sRGB images, even though
the image-signal-processing pipeline irreversibly mixes colors, clips dynamic
range, and blurs fine detail. This paper uses the rain degradation problem as a
use case to show that these losses are avoidable, and demonstrates that
learning directly on raw Bayer mosaics yields superior reconstructions. To
substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction
pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy
scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii)
introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that
aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split,
our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2%
ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs. The results advocate an
ISP-last paradigm for low-level vision and open the door to end-to-end
learnable camera pipelines.

Motivation: 现有超像素分割方法独立于聚类任务，导致分割结果与聚类目标不一致。

Method: 采用端到端框架，结合自表示网络和可微分超像素模块，联合优化。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 联合优化方法能有效提升聚类精度和适应性。

Abstract: Subspace clustering is a powerful unsupervised approach for hyperspectral
image (HSI) analysis, but its high computational and memory costs limit
scalability. Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the
number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods
usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often
producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering
objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that
jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is
a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded
Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven
signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization
yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial
structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness
parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive
segmentation. Extensive experiments on benchmark HSI datasets demonstrate that
our method consistently achieves superior accuracy compared with
state-of-the-art clustering approaches.

Conclusion: 大规模预训练数据诱导的有利损失景观是这一现象的原因。

Abstract: The widespread availability of pre-trained vision models has enabled numerous
deep learning applications through their transferable representations. However,
their computational and storage costs often limit practical deployment.
Pruning-at-Initialization has emerged as a promising approach to compress
models before training, enabling efficient task-specific adaptation. While
conventional wisdom suggests that effective pruning requires task-specific
data, this creates a challenge when downstream tasks are unknown in advance. In
this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained
vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot
performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models
not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out
tasks' performance. We attribute this phenomenon to the favorable loss
landscapes induced by extensive pre-training on large-scale datasets.

Result: Grounding IDs能增强注意力机制，减少幻觉，提升跨模态接地性能。

Conclusion: Grounding IDs是解释外部线索如何增强多模态绑定的关键机制，兼具可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) show strong performance across
multimodal benchmarks but remain limited in structured reasoning and precise
grounding. Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures,
such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal
mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this
phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced
by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across
modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers
emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the
modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that
these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show
that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in
turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together,
our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how
external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and
practical improvements in robustness.

Method: 提出VideoAR框架，支持全帧、关键细节帧、多尺度细化、时空立方体等多种预测单元。

Result: 时空立方体预测单元在质量、速度和时序一致性上表现最优，超越现有基线。

Conclusion: VideoAR突破了逐帧限制，为视频和其他时空领域的序列分解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive models for video generation typically operate frame-by-frame,
extending next-token prediction from language to video's temporal dimension. We
question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame
is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a
unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full
frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes.
Among these designs, we find model video generation using
\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive
models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously.
This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic
units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction
strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior
quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame
constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench
while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long
sequences. We hope this work will motivate rethinking sequence decomposition in
video and other spatiotemporal domains.

Conclusion: DualFlow在多模态人体运动生成中达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Generating realistic, context-aware two-person motion conditioned on diverse
modalities remains a central challenge in computer graphics, animation, and
human-computer interaction. We introduce DualFlow, a unified and efficient
framework for multi-modal two-person motion generation. DualFlow conditions 3D
motion synthesis on diverse inputs, including text, music, and prior motion
sequences. Leveraging rectified flow, it achieves deterministic straight-line
sampling paths between noise and data, reducing inference time and mitigating
error accumulation common in diffusion-based models. To enhance semantic
grounding, DualFlow employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that
retrieves motion exemplars using music features and LLM-based text
decompositions of spatial relations, body movements, and rhythmic patterns. We
use contrastive objective that further strengthens alignment with conditioning
signals and introduce synchronization loss that improves inter-person
coordination. Extensive evaluations across text-to-motion, music-to-motion, and
multi-modal interactive benchmarks show consistent gains in motion quality,
responsiveness, and efficiency. DualFlow produces temporally coherent and
rhythmically synchronized motions, setting state-of-the-art in multi-modal
human motion generation.

Result: 在多个RVOS基准测试中达到最优性能，且效率具有竞争力。

Conclusion: SVAC通过改进视频语言交互和分割精度，显著提升了RVOS性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment target objects in
video sequences based on natural language descriptions. While recent advances
in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have improved RVOS performance
through enhanced text-video understanding, several challenges remain, including
insufficient exploitation of MLLMs' prior knowledge, prohibitive computational
and memory costs for long-duration videos, and inadequate handling of complex
temporal dynamics. In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves
RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance
video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting
computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal
Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential
spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA)
strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video
clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art
performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency. Our code
is available at https://github.com/lizhang1998/SVAC.

other models. The GANji framework is an effective and accessible tool for
revealing the fundamental trade-offs between model architecture, computational

Method: 提出GMS框架，分为五个阶段，结合通用模型（Scanner）和专用模型（Locator）的互补优势。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上，GMS框架实现了35.7%的准确率，比单独模型提升10倍。

Conclusion: GMS框架展示了在通用GUI定位任务中的鲁棒性和潜力。

Abstract: Grounding natural language queries in graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
presents a challenging task that requires models to comprehend diverse UI
elements across various applications and systems, while also accurately
predicting the spatial coordinates for the intended operation. To tackle this
problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a
synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding
performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general
vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by
assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general
VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the
fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise
coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform
GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on
interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages
and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve
promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro
dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\%$
and $3.7\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration
within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\%$, representing a $10
\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong
baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential
for general-purpose GUI grounding.

Abstract: Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing
socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some
form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at
$411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by
ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning
has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and
achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an
automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale
Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three
pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and
ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global
benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability,

Conclusion: 当前AI审美预测方法不足，需改进策略以减少偏见。

Abstract: Bias can be introduced to AI systems even from seemingly balanced sources,
and AI facial beauty prediction is subject to ethnicity-based bias. This work
sounds warnings about AI's role in shaping aesthetic norms while providing
potential pathways toward equitable beauty technologies through comparative
analysis of models trained on SCUT-FBP5500 and MEBeauty datasets. Employing
rigorous statistical validation (Kruskal-Wallis H-tests, post hoc Dunn
analyses). It is demonstrated that both models exhibit significant prediction
disparities across ethnic groups $(p < 0.001)$, even when evaluated on the
balanced FairFace dataset. Cross-dataset validation shows algorithmic
amplification of societal beauty biases rather than mitigation based on
prediction and error parity. The findings underscore the inadequacy of current

Abstract: Diffusion models have significant advantages in the field of real-world video
super-resolution and have demonstrated strong performance in past research. In
recent diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) models, the number of
sampling steps has been reduced to just one, yet there remains significant room
for further optimization in inference efficiency. In this paper, we propose
FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by
implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted
as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training
framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve
additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training
strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for
the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to
converge. Experimental results show that FastVSR achieves speedups of 111.9
times compared to multi-step models and 3.92 times compared to existing
one-step models. We will release code and models at

Conclusion: 该研究为矢状面脊柱评估提供了无辐射解决方案，推动了AIS综合评估的进展。

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a complex three-dimensional spinal
deformity, and accurate morphological assessment requires evaluating both
coronal and sagittal alignment. While previous research has made significant
progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment,
reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing
radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose
LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal
radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed
backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal
alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal
morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface
geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the
radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that
progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding
radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based
Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from
RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model
morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the
first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and
lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen
produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based
methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics. This study offers a
promising, radiation-free solution for sagittal spine assessment and advances
comprehensive AIS evaluation.

Abstract: Medical image analysis faces significant challenges in data sharing due to
privacy regulations and complex institutional protocols. Dataset distillation
offers a solution to address these challenges by synthesizing compact datasets
that capture essential information from real, large medical datasets.
Trajectory matching has emerged as a promising methodology for dataset
distillation; however, existing methods primarily focus on terminal states,
overlooking crucial information in intermediate optimization states. We address
this limitation by proposing a shape-wise potential that captures the geometric

TL;DR: DECERN是一种结合差异混淆不确定性和校准多样性的主动学习方法，用于细粒度图像分类，显著提升了样本选择效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在细粒度图像分类中，由于类间差异细微，评估样本信息量具有挑战性。DECERN旨在通过多角度信息量度量解决这一问题。

Method: DECERN结合差异混淆不确定性和校准多样性，通过局部特征融合量化样本方向性和结构稳定性，并进行不确定性加权聚类以多样化样本。

Result: 在7个细粒度图像数据集和26种实验设置下，DECERN表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DECERN通过多角度信息量度量有效提升了细粒度图像分类中的样本选择效果。

Abstract: Active learning (AL) aims to build high-quality labeled datasets by
iteratively selecting the most informative samples from an unlabeled pool under
limited annotation budgets. However, in fine-grained image classification,
assessing this informativeness is especially challenging due to subtle
inter-class differences. In this paper, we introduce a novel method, combining
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity for active
fine-grained image classification (DECERN), to effectively perceive the
distinctiveness between fine-grained images and evaluate the sample value.
DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The
discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and
structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature
fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify
the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global
diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local
representativeness. Extensive experiments conducted on 7 fine-grained image
datasets across 26 distinct experimental settings demonstrate that our method
achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于放射组学特征的肿瘤生成模型，解决3D医学图像生成多样性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中，隐私问题导致数据获取困难，现有生成模型在3D医学图像中多样性不足。

Method: 结合GAN生成肿瘤掩膜和扩散模型生成肿瘤纹理，以放射组学特征为生成条件。

Result: 模型支持生成用户指定特征的肿瘤图像，测试覆盖四种器官的CT和MRI数据，合成图像有效辅助下游任务。

Conclusion: 该方法在治疗规划中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Due to privacy concerns, obtaining large datasets is challenging in medical
image analysis, especially with 3D modalities like Computed Tomography (CT) and
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing generative models, developed to
address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot
accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model
that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features
are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically
well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs
a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to
generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the
user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features
such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the
physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors
according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal,
manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in
different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different
organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized
images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their
authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has
potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.

Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a common therapy option before the main
surgery for breast cancer. Response to NAC is monitored using follow-up dynamic
contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). Accurate prediction of
NAC response helps with treatment planning. Here, we adopt maximum intensity
projection images from DCE-MRI to generate post-treatment images (i.e., 3 or 12
weeks after NAC) from pre-treatment images leveraging the emerging diffusion
model. We introduce prompt tuning to account for the known clinical factors
affecting response to NAC. Our model performed better than other generative
models in image quality metrics. Our model was better at generating images that
reflected changes in tumor size according to pCR compared to other models.
Ablation study confirmed the design choices of our method. Our study has the
potential to help with precision medicine.

TL;DR: TaSe框架通过解构和重组语言表示，显著提升了视觉语言模型处理复杂查询的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理涉及描述性属性和关系从句的复杂查询时表现不佳，主要源于文本编码器的局限性。

Method: 提出TaSe框架，包括分层合成数据集、解构模块和聚合模块，以增强语言结构的归纳偏差。

Result: 在OmniLabel基准测试中性能提升24%，验证了语言组合性的重要性。

Conclusion: TaSe框架通过分层语言结构显著提升了多模态表示能力。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in
multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple
language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive
complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our
in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders
in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate
target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex
queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose
restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical
relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight
is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects,
attributes, and relations ("talk in pieces")-and subsequently aggregating them
into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations ("see in whole").
Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main
contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three
tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the
three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss
function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in
Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically
structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The
proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical
linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for
language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel
benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of
linguistic compositionality.

TL;DR: 开发了一种高效的3D深度学习框架（T1C-RFlow），用于从多参数MRI生成T1对比增强图像，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GBCAs在T1w MRI中用于增强病变可视化，但有肾病风险且存在不一致性，因此需要无对比剂的方法。

Method: 使用预训练自编码器获取潜在空间表示，并在其中训练修正流扩散模型。

Result: T1C-RFlow在质量和速度上均优于基准模型（如pix2pix、DDPM等），且重建效果最佳。

Conclusion: 该方法可生成接近真实T1C的图像，未来可能实现无对比剂的脑肿瘤MRI。

Abstract: Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed
with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at
risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can
introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D
deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from
pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified
flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and
T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient
latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained
in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a
curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients),
meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets.
Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test
(N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate
that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM,
Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow
achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/-
0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/-
0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction
performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps)
than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and
patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method
generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much
less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a
practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.

Abstract: Unified video modeling that combines generation and understanding

MLLMs to video without costly retraining. We present UniVid, a unified
architecture that couples an MLLM with a diffusion decoder through a

introduce Temperature Modality Alignment to improve prompt adherence and
Pyramid Reflection for efficient temporal reasoning via dynamic keyframe
selection. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 2.2% improvement on VBench-Long total

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉基础模型（如SAM）在医学图像分割中表现不佳，需要高效且资源友好的适应方法。

Method: 结合互补细节增强网络、低秩适配器和低秩张量注意力机制，优化特征表示并减少资源消耗。

Result: 在标准数据集上，BALR-SAM无需提示即超越现有方法，仅更新1.8%参数。

Conclusion: BALR-SAM为医学图像分割提供了一种高效且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on
large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image
segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice,
fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal
resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To
address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation
framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored
components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using
depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture
boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank
adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature
representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously
significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention
mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting
inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show
that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8%
(11.7M) of its parameters.

Conclusion: Forge4D在动态3D人体重建和插值任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view
videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods,
however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of
generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose
Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that
efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated
sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our
model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint
task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For
the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static
3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable
state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by
interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For
novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict
dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an
occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at
arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion
supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching
task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module.
An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion
consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both
in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at:

Method: 提出AVF-MAE++，采用双掩码策略、增强的模态编码器和迭代相关性学习模块，结合渐进式语义注入策略。

Result: 在17个数据集上验证，AVF-MAE++在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: AVF-MAE++通过改进设计和模块，显著提升了AVFA任务的性能，并提供了深入的设计见解。

Abstract: Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field
for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to
suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised
learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with
growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven
essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its
specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in
this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through
scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose
AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently
investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal
correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy
across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a
more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we
present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves
correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of
previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we
further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the
model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on
17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++
achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.
Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each
proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving
these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.

Abstract: Despite the promise of foundation models in medical AI, current systems
remain limited - they are modality-specific and lack transparent reasoning
processes, hindering clinical adoption. To address this gap, we present
EVLF-FM, a multimodal vision-language foundation model (VLM) designed to unify
broad diagnostic capability with fine-grain explainability. The development and
testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global
datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties:
dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology.
External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional
datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to
assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with
pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation
for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858)
and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models.
In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across
nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External
validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with
competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training
strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not
only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step
reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early
multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that
could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world
clinical deployment.

Result: 在MMVP上达到71.67%的准确率，优于Qwen2.5-VL的66.67%。

Conclusion: LVR显著提升了细粒度视觉理解和感知能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in
various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language
spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for
visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning
trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained:
reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information
treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a
new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual
embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens
within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language
model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual
tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent
visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model
achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering
tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement
learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We
show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and
perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code
base and model weights will be released later.

Result: 实验显示CoTAM节省35.99%比特率，同时保持MLLM任务性能，优于现有神经编解码器。

Conclusion: CoTAM为MLLMs提供高效压缩方案，适应多任务需求，显著提升带宽利用率。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), typically hosted on cloud platforms, urgently requires effective
compression techniques to efficiently transmit signal inputs (e.g., images,
videos) from edge devices with minimal bandwidth usage. However, conventional
image codecs are optimized for fidelity to serve the Human Visual System (HVS)
and ill-suited for MLLMs, in which diverse downstream tasks are jointly
considered. In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of
compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression
distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying
effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance.
Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs
(CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different
demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer
attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical
semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter
with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of
low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of
cross-level features. Extensive experiments validate that our method achieves
up to 35.99\% bitrate saving while maintaining the same performance on the MLLM
tasks, outperforming previous SOTA neural codecs.

Conclusion: S$^2$NN为边缘计算提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer an energy-efficient paradigm for machine
intelligence, but their continued scaling poses challenges for resource-limited
deployment. Despite recent advances in binary SNNs, the storage and
computational demands remain substantial for large-scale networks. To further
explore the compression and acceleration potential of SNNs, we propose Sub-bit
Spiking Neural Networks (S$^2$NNs) that represent weights with less than one
bit. Specifically, we first establish an S$^2$NN baseline by leveraging the
clustering patterns of kernels in well-trained binary SNNs. This baseline is
highly efficient but suffers from \textit{outlier-induced codeword selection
bias} during training. To mitigate this issue, we propose an
\textit{outlier-aware sub-bit weight quantization} (OS-Quant) method, which
optimizes codeword selection by identifying and adaptively scaling outliers.
Furthermore, we propose a \textit{membrane potential-based feature
distillation} (MPFD) method, improving the performance of highly compressed
S$^2$NN via more precise guidance from a teacher model. Extensive results on
vision and non-vision tasks reveal that S$^2$NN outperforms existing quantized
SNNs in both performance and efficiency, making it promising for edge computing
applications.

Result: 在多个脑MRI数据集上的实验表明，CDM显著提升了条件准确性和图像质量（通过FID和SSIM衡量）。

Conclusion: CDM的循环策略可有效优化基于扩散的医学图像生成，适用于数据增强、反事实和疾病进展建模。

Abstract: Deep generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image
synthesis. However, ensuring conditioning faithfulness and high-quality
synthetic images for direct or counterfactual generation remains a challenge.
In this work, we introduce a cycle training framework to fine-tune diffusion
models for improved conditioning adherence and enhanced synthetic image
realism. Our approach, Cycle Diffusion Model (CDM), enforces consistency
between generated and original images by incorporating cycle constraints,
enabling more reliable direct and counterfactual generation. Experiments on a
combined 3D brain MRI dataset (from ABCD, HCP aging & young adults, ADNI, and
PPMI) show that our method improves conditioning accuracy and enhances image
quality as measured by FID and SSIM. The results suggest that the cycle
strategy used in CDM can be an effective method for refining diffusion-based
medical image generation, with applications in data augmentation,
counterfactual, and disease progression modeling.

### [233] [Skeleton-based Robust Registration Framework for Corrupted 3D Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24273)
*Yongqiang Wang,Weigang Li,Wenping Liu,Zhiqiang Tian,Jinling Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于骨架的鲁棒点云配准框架（SRRF），通过引入抗干扰的骨架表示，显著提升了配准的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的点云常因传感器限制、环境噪声和预处理误差而受到干扰，导致配准困难。现有方法依赖直接点匹配或表面特征提取，易受干扰影响。

Method: 结合骨架结构进行配准，通过源和目标骨架的一致性约束，设计分布距离损失函数，优化配准结果。

Result: 在多种干扰场景下，SRRF均优于现有方法，表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SRRF为真实场景中的3D感知任务提供了一种潜在的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including
autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of
multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction.
However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations,
environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging
due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations.
Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature
extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to
reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based
robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a
corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness
and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the
registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the
corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal
registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to
enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which
significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures
that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the
global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate
registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets
demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration
methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions,
noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the
robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential
approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.

TL;DR: CEGC是一个统一的、基于置信度的框架，用于鲁棒的部分3D点云配准，通过联合建模重叠置信度和对应可靠性，在复杂场景中实现精确对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分点云配准在自主感知和3D场景理解中至关重要，但由于结构模糊性、部分可见性和噪声等问题，仍然具有挑战性。

Method: CEGC通过混合重叠置信度估计模块（结合语义描述符和几何相似性）和上下文感知匹配策略（使用全局注意力分配软置信度分数），构建了一个紧密耦合的流水线。

Result: 在ModelNet40、ScanObjectNN和7Scenes等数据集上，CEGC在准确性、鲁棒性和泛化能力上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CEGC为具有挑战性的部分点云配准问题提供了一个可解释且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Partial point cloud registration is essential for autonomous perception and
3D scene understanding, yet it remains challenging owing to structural
ambiguity, partial visibility, and noise. We address these issues by proposing
Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven
framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment
in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence
reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap
confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric
similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The
context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global
attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving
robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value
decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled
pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually
reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D
vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable
and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging
conditions.

TL;DR: ASIA是一种通过少量图像注释实现3D分割的新框架，适用于非语义和难以文本描述的部件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D分割中多视图图像收集困难、3D模型标注复杂以及文本描述模糊的问题。

Method: 利用文本到图像扩散模型的先验知识，通过优化文本标记和跨视图部件对应损失实现分割。

Result: 在定量和定性评估中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ASIA为语义和非语义3D分割任务提供了实用且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ASIA (Adaptive 3D Segmentation using few Image Annotations), a
novel framework that enables segmentation of possibly non-semantic and
non-text-describable "parts" in 3D. Our segmentation is controllable through a
few user-annotated in-the-wild images, which are easier to collect than
multi-view images, less demanding to annotate than 3D models, and more precise
than potentially ambiguous text descriptions. Our method leverages the rich
priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to
transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and
target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training,
we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel
cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view
renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them
with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back
onto the mesh. ASIA provides a practical and generalizable solution for both
semantic and non-semantic 3D segmentation tasks, outperforming existing methods
by a noticeable margin in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到SVG生成中的泛化能力差和指令遵循不足的问题。

Result: 实验表明SVGThinker生成的SVG更稳定、可编辑且质量更高。

Conclusion: SVGThinker为设计和自动化图形生成提供了新方向。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a code-based representation for 2D visuals.
Leveraging recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we study
text-to-SVG generation and address two persistent gaps: weak generalization and
poor adherence to input instructions. We present SVGThinker, a reasoning-driven
framework that aligns the production of SVG code with the visualization process
and supports the full set of SVG primitives. Our pipeline first renders each
primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and
code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of
primitives. On this data, we train an LLM with supervised fine-tuning that
exposes its chain-of-thought as intermediate reasoning, improving robustness
and reducing errors and hallucinations. Experiments against state-of-the-art
baselines show that SVGThinker produces more stable, editable, and
higher-quality SVGs while preserving the structural advantages of vector
graphics. Unlike image-based methods, our outputs enable precise and
hierarchical editing, opening new directions for design, content creation, and
automated graphics generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频推理中均匀帧采样和静态文本推理的低效问题，提升视觉密集型视频任务的处理能力。

Method: 提出FrameThinker框架，采用两阶段训练策略（SFT和RL），优化奖励设计以指导模型学习新动作。

Result: 在多个基准测试中平均提升10.4%，7B模型在LongVideo-Reason上达到76.1%准确率，仅用20.6帧。

Conclusion: FrameThinker在长视频推理中实现了高效和有效性，显著优于基线方法。

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress
in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered
by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient
and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these
challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long
videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs
are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video
reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in
adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing
reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve
these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities,
followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making
policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive
exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive
experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and
long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and
LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average
improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of
processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new
state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average
of only 20.6 frames. This not only outperforms the competitive LongVILA-R1
(72.0%) but does so with over 20x fewer frames (vs. 512), demonstrating
unparalleled efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: 在室内重建基准测试中表现优异，Chamfer-$L_1$降低47.3%，同时保持新颖视图渲染质量。

Conclusion: OMeGa有效解决了无纹理室内重建的局限性，实现了几何精度和渲染质量的平衡。

Abstract: Neural rendering with Gaussian splatting has advanced novel view synthesis,
and most methods reconstruct surfaces via post-hoc mesh extraction. However,
existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) inaccurate geometry in
texture-less indoor regions, and (ii) the decoupling of mesh extraction from
optimization, thereby missing the opportunity to leverage mesh geometry to
guide splat optimization. In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end
framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian
splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian
Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on
splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh
constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby
regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative
mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable
ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh.
OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor
reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\% over the 2DGS
baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality. The
experimental results demonstrate that OMeGa effectively addresses prior
limitations in indoor texture-less reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了冷冻电子断层扫描中子断层图分析的规模和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables in situ visualization of
macromolecular structures, where subtomogram analysis tasks such as
classification, alignment, and averaging are critical for structural
determination. However, effective analysis is hindered by scarce annotations,
severe noise, and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we take the
first step towards foundation models for cryo-ET subtomograms. First, we
introduce CryoEngine, a large-scale synthetic data generator that produces over
904k subtomograms from 452 particle classes for pretraining. Second, we design
an Adaptive Phase Tokenization-enhanced Vision Transformer (APT-ViT), which
incorporates adaptive phase tokenization as an equivariance-enhancing module
that improves robustness to both geometric and semantic variations. Third, we
introduce a Noise-Resilient Contrastive Learning (NRCL) strategy to stabilize
representation learning under severe noise conditions. Evaluations across 24
synthetic and real datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on
all three major subtomogram tasks and strong generalization to unseen datasets,
advancing scalable and robust subtomogram analysis in cryo-ET.

Result: 在标准语义对应基准测试中，MambaMatcher达到最先进性能。

Abstract: Establishing semantic correspondences between images is a fundamental yet
challenging task in computer vision. Traditional feature-metric methods enhance
visual features but may miss complex inter-correlation relationships, while
recent correlation-metric approaches are hindered by high computational costs
due to processing 4D correlation maps. We introduce MambaMatcher, a novel
method that overcomes these limitations by efficiently modeling
high-dimensional correlations using selective state-space models (SSMs). By
implementing a similarity-aware selective scan mechanism adapted from Mamba's
linear-complexity algorithm, MambaMatcher refines the 4D correlation map
effectively without compromising feature map resolution or receptive field.
Experiments on standard semantic correspondence benchmarks demonstrate that
MambaMatcher achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Accurate animal counting is essential for smart farming but remains difficult
in crowded scenes due to occlusions and limited camera views. To address this,
we propose a tri-plane-based multi-view chicken counting model (TP-MVCC), which
leverages geometric projection and tri-plane fusion to integrate features from
multiple cameras onto a unified ground plane. The framework extracts
single-view features, aligns them via spatial transformation, and decodes a
scene-level density map for precise chicken counting. In addition, we construct
the first multi-view dataset of silkie chickens under real farming conditions.
Experiments show that TP-MVCC significantly outperforms single-view and
conventional fusion comparisons, achieving 95.1\% accuracy and strong
robustness in dense, occluded scenarios, demonstrating its practical potential

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续令牌AR模型在图像生成中表现不佳，主要原因是VAE潜在变量的方差异质性导致解码时方差崩溃。

Method: 提出SphereAR，约束所有AR输入输出（包括CFG后）在固定半径超球面上，利用超球面VAE消除尺度分量。

Result: SphereAR在ImageNet生成上达到FID 1.34，优于同类AR模型，甚至超越更大规模的基线模型。

Conclusion: SphereAR首次证明纯AR模型在可比参数规模下超越扩散和掩码生成模型。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models are promising for image generation, yet
continuous-token AR variants often trail latent diffusion and masked-generation
models. The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is
amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG),
and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its
core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG --
to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\ell_2$ norm), leveraging
hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical
constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance
collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet
generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models,
achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54
and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger
baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92). To our knowledge,
this is the first time a pure next-token AR image generator with raster order
surpasses diffusion and masked-generation models at comparable parameter
scales.

Motivation: 现有方法难以应对需要多图像输入和动态农业场景的挑战，且缺乏系统质量控制。

Method: 框架包含四个角色：检索器、反思器、回答器和改进器，分别负责信息检索、评估、回答生成和迭代改进。

Result: 在AgMMU基准测试中表现优异，适用于多图像农业问答。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多智能体协作有效解决了农业视觉问答中的复杂需求。

Abstract: Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and
researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing
approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such
as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from
coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image
inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages.
Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes
these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid
pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we
propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that
integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the
Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning,
answer drafting, and iterative improvement.
  A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a
Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed
retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias.
The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that
information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized.
Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive
performance on multi-image agricultural QA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频生成方法通常逐帧处理，计算量大且效率低。NeRV-Diffusion旨在通过隐式神经表示（INR）和扩散模型结合，实现整体视频压缩与生成。

Method: 1) 使用超网络将视频从像素空间编码为神经参数空间；2) 通过隐式扩散变换器对INR权重去噪。

Result: 在UCF-101和Kinetics-600等基准测试中，NeRV-Diffusion表现优于其他INR模型，并与非隐式模型性能相当。

Conclusion: NeRV-Diffusion提供了一种高效的视频生成方法，并支持帧间或视频间的平滑插值。

Abstract: We present NeRV-Diffusion, an implicit latent video diffusion model that
synthesizes videos via generating neural network weights. The generated weights
can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which
forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with
frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A
hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural
parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode.
2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights.
In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise
feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a
unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis
via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding
video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR
weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all
NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and
input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled
sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion
reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and
comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on
real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600. It also brings
a smooth INR weight space that facilitates seamless interpolations between
frames or videos.

Conclusion: LamFormer在多器官分割任务中表现出色，解决了Transformer的局限性，并实现了性能与复杂度的平衡。

Abstract: In the field of multi-organ medical image segmentation, recent methods
frequently employ Transformers to capture long-range dependencies from image
features. However, these methods overlook the high computational cost of
Transformers and their deficiencies in extracting local detailed information.
To address high computational costs and inadequate local detail information, we
reassess the design of feature extraction modules and propose a new
deep-learning network called LamFormer for fine-grained segmentation tasks
across multiple organs. LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs
Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture
multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical
Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers
of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering
information. Finally, we design the Reduced Transformer (RT), which utilizes a
distinct computational approach to globally model up-sampled features. RRT
enhances the extraction of detailed local information and improves the
network's capability to capture long-range dependencies. LamFormer outperforms
existing segmentation methods on seven complex and diverse datasets,
demonstrating exceptional performance. Moreover, the proposed network achieves
a balance between model performance and model complexity.

Motivation: 深度神经网络对对抗样本高度脆弱，现有防御方法在梯度可估计时容易失效。梯度共识是攻击者利用的关键因素。

Method: 引入DRIFT，一种随机轻量级滤波器集成，通过最大化梯度和logit空间的差异来破坏梯度共识。

Result: DRIFT在ImageNet上显著提升鲁棒性，优于现有预处理、对抗训练和扩散防御方法。

Conclusion: 梯度分歧是实用且可泛化的对抗防御原则，DRIFT在性能和成本上表现优异。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples, and
most defenses collapse once gradients can be reliably estimated. We identify
\emph{gradient consensus}--the tendency of randomized transformations to yield
aligned gradients--as a key driver of adversarial transferability. Attackers
exploit this consensus to construct perturbations that remain effective across
transformations. We introduce \textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered
Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters
trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized
defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \emph{gradient
dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses
while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we
formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking
consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training
strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space
separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves
substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers,
outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and
diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and
gradient-free attacks. DRIFT delivers these improvements with negligible
runtime and memory cost, establishing gradient divergence as a practical and
generalizable principle for adversarial defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs在特定领域（如UI）任务中的理解和生成质量不足的问题。

Method: 结合SFT和GRPO优化UI理解任务，使用DPO提升UI生成质量，并提出工业级工作流程。

Result: 在理解任务上超越通用MLLMs和专用模型，生成任务上以更低计算成本达到同等性能。

Conclusion: UI-UG通过整合理解和生成任务，提升了双方的准确性和质量。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied
across domains, they are still facing challenges in domain-specific tasks, such
as User Interface (UI) understanding accuracy and UI generation quality. In
this paper, we introduce UI-UG (a unified MLLM for UI Understanding and
Generation), integrating both capabilities. For understanding tasks, we employ
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) to enhance fine-grained understanding on the modern complex UI data. For
generation tasks, we further use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to make
our model generate human-preferred UIs. In addition, we propose an industrially
effective workflow, including the design of an LLM-friendly domain-specific
language (DSL), training strategies, rendering processes, and evaluation
metrics. In experiments, our model achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance
on understanding tasks, outperforming both larger general-purpose MLLMs and
similarly-sized UI-specialized models. Our model is also on par with these
larger MLLMs in UI generation performance at a fraction of the computational
cost. We also demonstrate that integrating understanding and generation tasks
can improve accuracy and quality for both tasks.

TL;DR: Uni-X提出了一种两端分离、中间共享的架构，解决了多模态共享自回归变压器中的梯度冲突问题，提升了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态共享变压器在浅层和深层存在严重的视觉与文本梯度冲突，影响了模型性能。

Method: Uni-X采用两端分离、中间共享的X形设计，分别处理模态特定和语义融合任务。

Result: Uni-X在3B参数规模下，性能优于7B基线模型，图像生成得分82，并在文本和视觉任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: Uni-X是一种参数高效且可扩展的统一多模态建模基础架构。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR)
transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we
identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs,
modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between
vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue
to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and
text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where
representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this
challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture.
Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing,
while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level
semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at
both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical
training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to
strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X
matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for
image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding
tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable
foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: R$^2$M是一种无需训练的模型合并框架，通过分解任务向量和降噪残差，有效提升深度伪造检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造生成器快速进化，传统数据收集和重新训练方法不切实际，模型合并成为更优选择。

Method: 提出R$^2$M框架，通过低秩分解任务向量、对齐真实部分、降噪残差，并聚合任务规范匹配。

Result: R$^2$M在多种测试场景中优于联合训练和其他合并方法，且具有可组合性。

Conclusion: R$^2$M为深度伪造检测提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Deepfake generators evolve quickly, making exhaustive data collection and
repeated retraining impractical. We argue that model merging is a natural fit
for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint
labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in
generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging
preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building
upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a
training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real
component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each
specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals
with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching
to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains
why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation
direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor
off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset,
R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly,
R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one
specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.

Conclusion: 混合框架成功生成真实且地理一致的街景图像，保留了局部细节和大气元素。

Abstract: Street view imagery has become an essential source for geospatial data
collection and urban analytics, enabling the extraction of valuable insights
that support informed decision-making. However, synthesizing street-view images
from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to
substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two
domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based
models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate
geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our
approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable
Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance
the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent
panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that
leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations,
thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated
street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging
Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image
synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach
outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based
methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically
consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details,
including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as
clouds.

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖几何信息，未能充分利用图像的纹理和语义信息，且特征融合方式有损。

Method: 使用DINOv2提取视觉特征，在补丁级别融合视觉和几何特征，并提出混合位置嵌入。

Result: 在RGBD-3DMatch和RGBD-3DLoMatch数据集上，配准召回率和补丁内点率分别提升15.7%和14.2%。

Conclusion: DINOReg通过结合视觉和几何信息，显著提升了点云配准性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most
existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction
and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information
from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve
remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and
semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an
image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose
DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and
geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired
by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract
informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features
at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and
global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric
structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed
positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both
image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to
perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the
RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal
registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7%
increase in registration recall. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像的标注成本高且质量不稳定，限制了其在大规模土地覆盖分析中的应用。

Method: 利用空间自相关原理，将语义一致的掩码组作为最小标注单元，实现多实例同时标注。

Result: MCAE将标注效率提高了一到两个数量级，并构建了包含约140亿标记像素的HiCity-LC数据集，分类精度超过85%。

Conclusion: MCAE展示了在大规模、高分辨率土地覆盖制图中的可扩展性和实用性，HiCity-LC数据集为相关研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution
imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained
land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized -
particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of
sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically
derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often
unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual
detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial
autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend
to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the
Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically
consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient,
simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves
annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label
quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we
build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels,
referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land
cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies
above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level
land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of
MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: REALIGN是一种基于正则化融合部分Gromov-Wasserstein最优传输的自监督框架，用于处理程序性视频中的噪声和非单调步骤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 程序性视频中存在背景片段、重复动作和步骤顺序混乱的问题，现有方法（如OPEL）仅依赖特征相似性，无法捕捉高阶时间结构。

Method: 提出R-FPGWOT方法，联合建模视觉对应和时间关系，并结合序列间对比学习以稳定训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，REALIGN实现了显著的性能提升（F1-score提高18.9%，时间IoU提升30%），并生成更可解释的传输映射。

Conclusion: REALIGN能够有效处理程序性视频中的噪声和非单调步骤，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised
representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains
background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such
variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many
alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage
Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences,
but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order
temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a
self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused
Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT,
our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations
under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant
frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional
videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with
inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple
regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric
(EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves
up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains,
while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step
orderings and filter out noise.

Conclusion: Vid-LLM通过视频输入实现了高效的3D场景理解，具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: Recent developments in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved Vision-Language (VL) reasoning in 2D domains. However,
extending these capabilities to 3D scene understanding remains a major
challenge. Existing 3D Multimodal Large Language Models (3D-MLLMs) often depend
on 3D data inputs, which limits scalability and generalization. To address this
limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes
video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for
real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to
improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric
cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to
align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To
ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model
that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the
model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy,
realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments
across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D
Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks,
demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.

Motivation: 自动驾驶出租车在ODD内运行时需可靠检测弱势道路使用者（VRUs），但现有数据集（如SMIRK）仅支持单一行人场景，无法满足复杂交通需求。

Result: PCICF在PIE数据集上成功识别和分类复杂行人过马路场景（如行人合并或分散），并具备车载应用潜力。

Conclusion: PCICF为自动驾驶系统提供了高效的事件分析工具，开源实现和数据集支持进一步研究。

Abstract: We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various
countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on
specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous
monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs
typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road
users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better
handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute
vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for
perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically
training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose
PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to
support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic
dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design
into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian
crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling
curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into
characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in
MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which
contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show
that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings,
even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally
efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of
robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication
package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and
dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in:

viewpoint deviations into a single latent for improved efficiency and

TL;DR: CLQ是一种针对扩散变换器（DiTs）的跨层引导正交量化方法，通过改进校准数据、平滑异常值和跨层参数搜索，显著减少了模型的内存占用和推理时间，同时保持视觉生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器（DiTs）的模型规模和复杂性限制了其在边缘设备上的实际部署，而现有的后训练量化（PTQ）方法会导致性能下降。

Method: CLQ包含三个关键设计：跨块校准（CBC）获取准确的校准数据，正交平滑（OBS）处理异常值，以及跨层参数搜索（CLPS）优化量化参数。

Result: CLQ成功将模型压缩为W4A4，视觉质量和指标几乎无损，实现了3.98倍内存节省和3.95倍加速。

Conclusion: CLQ为DiTs的高效部署提供了一种有效的量化解决方案，显著提升了模型在边缘设备上的实用性。

Abstract: Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances
in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model
size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical
deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application.
Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training
quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the
inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the
degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization
method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we
observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not
honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose
cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which
the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based
smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and
leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible
overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search.
We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and
successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual
quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our
code is available at

Motivation: 随着模型架构成熟，数据质量成为关键因素，但图像数据集质量的系统性研究仍有限。

Method: 使用CIFAKE数据集识别质量问题，结合CleanVision和Fastdup工具并引入自动阈值选择等增强功能。

Result: 自动阈值方法显著提升了F1分数，尤其在单扰动和双扰动情况下效果明显。

Conclusion: 研究证明了数据质量评估的重要性，并提供了有效的工具和方法，为图像机器学习的数据质量评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: In machine learning, research has traditionally focused on model development,
with relatively less attention paid to training data. As model architectures
have matured and marginal gains from further refinements diminish, data quality
has emerged as a critical factor. However, systematic studies on evaluating and
ensuring dataset quality in the image domain remain limited.
  This study investigates methods for systematically assessing image dataset
quality and examines how various image quality factors influence model
performance. Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset,
we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training.
Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two
community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying
mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold
selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning.
  Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same
level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain
distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure
critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess
the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed
enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary
classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our
automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under
single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For
near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score
from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our
workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in
image-based machine learning.

Result: 在MatrixCity Streets数据集上，Proxy-GS实现2.5倍加速并提升渲染质量。

Conclusion: Proxy-GS通过遮挡感知优化，显著提升了3D高斯溅射的渲染性能。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for
achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve
visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering.
To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail
(LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number
of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals
that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion
awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a
proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of
our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion
depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles:
first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering
speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training,
avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering
quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset,
Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering
capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves
more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially
higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.

Conclusion: DCFlow通过解耦优化和跨模态约束显著提升了跨模态流估计的准确性。

Abstract: This work presents DCFlow, a novel unsupervised cross-modal flow estimation
framework that integrates a decoupled optimization strategy and a cross-modal
consistency constraint. Unlike previous approaches that implicitly learn flow
estimation solely from appearance similarity, we introduce a decoupled
optimization strategy with task-specific supervision to address modality
discrepancy and geometric misalignment distinctly. This is achieved by
collaboratively training a modality transfer network and a flow estimation
network. To enable reliable motion supervision without ground-truth flow, we
propose a geometry-aware data synthesis pipeline combined with an
outlier-robust loss. Additionally, we introduce a cross-modal consistency
constraint to jointly optimize both networks, significantly improving flow
prediction accuracy. For evaluation, we construct a comprehensive cross-modal
flow benchmark by repurposing public datasets. Experimental results demonstrate
that DCFlow can be integrated with various flow estimation networks and
achieves state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised approaches.

*Ailing Zhang,Lina Lei,Dehong Kong,Zhixin Wang,Jiaqi Xu,Fenglong Song,Chun-Le Guo,Chang Liu,Fan Li,Jie Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UI2V-Bench是一个新的基准测试，专注于评估图像到视频（I2V）模型的语义理解和推理能力，填补了现有评估方法的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估基准主要关注视频质量和时间一致性，而忽略了模型对输入图像语义的理解能力及生成视频是否符合物理规律和常识。

Method: 设计了基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的两种评估方法：实例级管道用于细粒度语义理解，反馈推理管道用于逐步因果评估。

Result: UI2V-Bench包含约500个文本-图像对，评估了开源和闭源I2V模型，并与人类评估结果高度一致。

Conclusion: UI2V-Bench填补了I2V评估的关键空白，为未来研究和模型开发提供了强有力的框架和数据集。

Abstract: Generative diffusion models are developing rapidly and attracting increasing
attention due to their wide range of applications. Image-to-Video (I2V)
generation has become a major focus in the field of video synthesis. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on aspects such as video quality
and temporal consistency, while largely overlooking the model's ability to
understand the semantics of specific subjects in the input image or to ensure
that the generated video aligns with physical laws and human commonsense. To
address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V
models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four
primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding,
category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design
two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an
instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a
feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment
for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully
constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and
closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate
human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based
metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by
emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust
framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the
field.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NeoWorld是一个从单张输入图像生成交互式3D虚拟世界的深度学习框架，通过混合2D和3D表示实现高效渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受科幻小说《Simulacron-3》中按需构建世界的概念启发，旨在为用户提供动态、沉浸式的探索体验。

Method: 采用混合场景结构，对关键前景对象进行完整3D建模，背景和非交互区域则用2D合成，结合表示学习和对象到3D技术。

Result: 在WorldScore基准测试中显著优于现有2D和2.5D方法，支持灵活视角操作和物理合理的场景动画。

Conclusion: NeoWorld通过渐进式3D细节渲染，实现了高效且视觉一致的虚拟世界探索。

Abstract: We introduce NeoWorld, a deep learning framework for generating interactive
3D virtual worlds from a single input image. Inspired by the on-demand
worldbuilding concept in the science fiction novel Simulacron-3 (1964), our
system constructs expansive environments where only the regions actively
explored by the user are rendered with high visual realism through
object-centric 3D representations. Unlike previous approaches that rely on
global world generation or 2D hallucination, NeoWorld models key foreground
objects in full 3D, while synthesizing backgrounds and non-interacted regions
in 2D to ensure efficiency. This hybrid scene structure, implemented with
cutting-edge representation learning and object-to-3D techniques, enables
flexible viewpoint manipulation and physically plausible scene animation,
allowing users to control object appearance and dynamics using natural language
commands. As users interact with the environment, the virtual world
progressively unfolds with increasing 3D detail, delivering a dynamic,
immersive, and visually coherent exploration experience. NeoWorld significantly
outperforms existing 2D and depth-layered 2.5D methods on the WorldScore
benchmark.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的视频问答（VideoQA）框架，通过生成更丰富的监督信号（QBP和QBC）来提升模型性能，实现了显著的准确率提升和更快的收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VideoQA模型受限于孤立的事实问答对监督，无法捕捉视频的叙事和因果结构，导致对视频内容的理解较浅。

Method: 提出了两种互补策略：基于问题的转述（QBP）生成叙事段落，以及基于问题的字幕生成（QBC）生成细粒度的视觉依据，利用生成模型合成数据并训练模型。

Result: 在STAR和NExT-QA数据集上实现了显著的准确率提升（如STAR上提升4.9%），并增强了跨数据集泛化能力，QBP还加速了模型收敛速度2.5倍以上。

Conclusion: 通过将数据合成从孤立事实转向叙事连贯性和依据性，能够实现更准确、高效和泛化的训练范式。

Abstract: The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally
constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of
isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This "bag-of-facts" approach fails to
capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting
models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this
paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We
propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which
synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set
of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs
the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which
generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question
in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use
this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token
prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our
approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new
state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\% on STAR
(+4.9\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis
reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset
generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over
2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated
facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate,
efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识蒸馏的双模型集成方法，用于通用异常检测，在工业和语义异常检测任务中均取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在工业检测和语义异常检测之间存在性能差距，且对数据集设置敏感。

Method: 使用教师-学生模型框架，结合编码器-解码器和编码器-编码器模型，通过Noisy-OR目标联合学习。

Result: 在多个基准测试中（如MVTec-AD和CIFAR-10）取得最高准确率，AUROC分别达到99.7%和97.8%。

Conclusion: 该方法在通用异常检测任务中表现出色，优于现有通用和专用模型。

Abstract: Anomaly detection (AD) plays an important role in various real-world
applications. Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards
industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic
anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to
address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to
dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to
bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an
Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for
industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both
models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality
feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR
objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability
via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We
evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and
multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial
inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection.
The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in
multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization
across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level
AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better
than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than
the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过Laban Effort和Shape组件实现细粒度控制的文本到动作生成方法，无需额外数据即可生成多样化的表达性动作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到动作生成方法在表达性动作控制上存在不足，主要由于数据集缺乏风格多样性和自然语言难以量化表达动作特性。

Method: 提出了一种零样本推理优化方法，通过更新预训练扩散模型的文本嵌入，在采样步骤中引导生成具有目标Laban标签的动作。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成多样化的表达性动作，同时保持动作身份，成功根据目标Laban标签操控动作属性。

Conclusion: 通过整合Laban运动分析方法，实现了对动作生成的解释性和表达性控制，为细粒度动作生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diverse human motion generation is an increasingly important task, having
various applications in computer vision, human-computer interaction and
animation. While text-to-motion synthesis using diffusion models has shown
success in generating high-quality motions, achieving fine-grained expressive
motion control remains a significant challenge. This is due to the lack of
motion style diversity in datasets and the difficulty of expressing
quantitative characteristics in natural language. Laban movement analysis has
been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including
motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for
interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly
integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components
into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot,
inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have
desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by
updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling
step. We demonstrate that our approach yields diverse expressive motion
qualities while preserving motion identity by successfully manipulating motion
attributes according to target Laban tags.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在空间智能方面的不足。

Method: 构建Euclid30K数据集，使用GRPO方法微调模型。

Result: 模型在多个空间推理基准测试中取得显著提升。

Conclusion: 几何中心微调可广泛提升视觉语言模型的空间技能。

Abstract: Spatial intelligence spans a rich suite of abilities, including visualising
and transforming shapes, mentally rotating objects, judging relational
positions and containment, and estimating numerosity. However, it still remains
a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To
fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a
surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal
dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid
geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean
principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family,
inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and
perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our
experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot
gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench,
VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after
training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models
rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them,
RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\% accuracy, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first
systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer
vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills. Code and
Euclid30K dataset can be found in https://zgca-ai4edu.github.io/Euclids_Gift.

Motivation: 时尚产业是浪费和排放的主要来源，二手市场的发展需要大规模评估二手服装的机器学习方法。

Method: 采用聚类和核心集选择方法识别代表性样本，并引入基于邻域一致性评分的异常值去除方法。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上验证，系统在减少计算成本的同时保持了接近最优的准确性。

Conclusion: 选择性表示框架和异常值去除方法显著提升了检索效率和性能。

Abstract: The fashion industry has been identified as a major contributor to waste and
emissions, leading to an increased interest in promoting the second-hand
market. Machine learning methods play an important role in facilitating the
creation and expansion of second-hand marketplaces by enabling the large-scale
valuation of used garments. We contribute to this line of work by addressing
the scalability of second-hand image retrieval from databases. By introducing a
selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their
original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore
clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples
that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability.
Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a
neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out
uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three
public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2.
The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by
strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The
retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing
computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database.
Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques
yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples
before the selection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型中的视觉幻觉问题，避免直接偏好优化（DPO）的语义捕捉不足和捷径学习问题。

Method: 提出语义课程偏好优化（SCPO），基于难度分级的语义对比数据集，结合动态参考模型和双向目标进行训练。

Result: 在LLaVA模型上实验表明，SCPO显著降低幻觉率（最高62.9%），同时保持通用能力。

Conclusion: SCPO首次统一语义、对称性和课程学习，有效缓解视觉幻觉，提升模型事实性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have significantly improved the
performance of various tasks, but continue to suffer from visual
hallucinations, a critical issue where generated responses contradict visual
evidence. While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for
alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained
semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these
challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a
novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard
curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which
provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum
is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional
objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual
preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics,
symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual
hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and
versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to
baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the
hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized
benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general
capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general
vision-language benchmarks.

TL;DR: EQUISeg通过平衡模态贡献提升多模态分割的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多模态分割中存在模态依赖不平衡问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出EQUISeg框架，采用四阶段跨模态Transformer块（CMTB）和自引导模块（SGM）平衡模态贡献。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，有效缓解模态不平衡的负面影响。

Conclusion: EQUISeg在多模态分割任务中显著提升性能并增强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic segmentation enhances model robustness by exploiting
cross-modal complementarities. However, existing methods often suffer from
imbalanced modal dependencies, where overall performance degrades significantly
once a dominant modality deteriorates in real-world scenarios. Thus, modality
balance has become acritical challenge for practical multimodal segmentation.
To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework
that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.
Built upon a four-stage Cross-modal Transformer Block(CMTB), EQUISeg enables
efficient multimodal fusion and hierarchical selection. Furthermore, we design
a Self-guided Module(SGM) that mitigates modality imbalance by introducing a
mutual guidance mechanism, enabling each modality to adaptively adjust its
contribution and enhance robustness under degraded conditions. Extensive
experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that EQUISeg achieves significant
performance gains and effectively alleviates the adverse effects of modality
imbalance in segmentation tasks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的指令驱动图像编辑方法在复杂场景中表现不佳，尤其是在处理多对象数量和空间布局时。

Method: QL-Adapter包含两个核心模块：Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM)用于融合布局先验和图像特征，Cross-Modal Augmentation Module (CMAM)用于增强文本嵌入。

Result: QL-Adapter在QL-Edit任务上实现了最先进的性能，显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: QL-Adapter通过结合布局和跨模态增强，有效提升了复杂场景中的图像编辑能力。

Abstract: Instruction driven image editing with standard CLIP text encoders often fails
in complex scenes with many objects. We present QL-Adapter, a framework for
multiple object editing that tackles two challenges: enforcing object counts
and spatial layouts, and accommodating diverse categories. QL-Adapter consists
of two core modules: the Image-Layout Fusion Module (ILFM) and the Cross-Modal
Augmentation Module (CMAM). ILFM fuses layout priors with ViT patch tokens from
the CLIP image encoder to strengthen spatial structure understanding. CMAM
injects image features into the text branch to enrich textual embeddings and
improve instruction following. We further build QL-Dataset, a benchmark that
spans broad category, layout, and count variations, and define the task of
quantity and layout consistent image editing (QL-Edit). Extensive experiments
show that QL-Adapter achieves state of the art performance on QL-Edit and
significantly outperforms existing models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Consistency Mid-Training (CMT)的中间训练方法，用于稳定和高效地训练流映射模型，显著减少了训练时间和资源消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流映射模型（如CM和MF）训练不稳定、对超参数敏感且成本高，即使从预训练扩散模型初始化仍无法完全解决这些问题。

Method: CMT在预训练和最终流映射训练之间插入一个轻量级中间阶段，训练模型直接从先验样本映射到求解器生成的干净样本，提供轨迹一致且稳定的初始化。

Result: CMT在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能（如CIFAR-10上两步FID为1.97），同时减少了高达98%的训练数据和GPU时间。

Conclusion: CMT是一种高效、通用的流映射模型训练框架，显著提升了训练效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable
few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion
models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and
costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still
requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving
instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and
practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the
(diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training)
for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact
and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver
trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to
the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable
initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based
baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing
post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning.
Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10,
1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98%
less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT
reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared
to MF from scratch (FID 3.43). This establishes CMT as a principled, efficient,
and general framework for training flow map models.

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化掩码生成和语义嵌入，显著提升了3D场景理解的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D scene understanding is fundamental for embodied AI and robotics,
supporting reliable perception for interaction and navigation. Recent
approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning
embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language
models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often
produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct
use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To
address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement
to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the
over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla
SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance
semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that
integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined
weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on
multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and
object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 实验表明Diffusion Bridge在稳定性和效率上更优，Flow Matching在小数据量时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 论文明确了两种模型的优缺点，为选择适合场景的模型提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Diffusion Bridge and Flow Matching have both demonstrated compelling
empirical performance in transformation between arbitrary distributions.
However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable,
and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical
implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative
merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and
experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through
the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the
Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural
trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport,
interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly
ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these
theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion
Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with
the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various
experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting,
Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks,
systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different
difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align
perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the
respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models. Our code is

Abstract: Aiming at the key challenges of crowd counting in foggy environments, such as
long-range target blurring, local feature degradation, and image contrast
attenuation, this paper proposes a crowd-counting method with a physical a
priori of atmospheric scattering, which improves crowd counting accuracy under
complex meteorological conditions through the synergistic optimization of the
physical mechanism and data-driven.Specifically, first, the method introduces a
differentiable atmospheric scattering model and employs transmittance dynamic
estimation and scattering parameter adaptive calibration techniques to
accurately quantify the nonlinear attenuation laws of haze on targets with
different depths of field.Secondly, the MSA-KAN was designed based on the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Representation Theorem to construct a learnable edge
activation function. By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with
adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear
representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing
feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a
weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using
deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\%-27.5\% reduction in MAE metrics
compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models (VideoLLMs) call for new
evaluation protocols and benchmarks for complex temporal reasoning in
video-language understanding. Inspired by the needle in a haystack test widely
used by LLMs, we introduce a novel task of Needle in a Montage (NeMo), designed
to assess VideoLLMs' critical reasoning capabilities, including long-context
recall and temporal grounding. To generate video question answering data for
our task, we develop a scalable automated data generation pipeline that
facilitates high-quality data synthesis. Built upon the proposed pipeline, we
present NeMoBench, a video-language benchmark centered on our task.
Specifically, our full set of NeMoBench features 31,378 automatically generated
question-answer (QA) pairs from 13,486 videos with various durations ranging
from seconds to hours. Experiments demonstrate that our pipeline can reliably
and automatically generate high-quality evaluation data, enabling NeMoBench to
be continuously updated with the latest videos. We evaluate 20 state-of-the-art
models on our benchmark, providing extensive results and key insights into
their capabilities and limitations. Our project page is available at:

### [276] [TokenSwap: Backdoor Attack on the Compositional Understanding of Large Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24566)
*Zhifang Zhang,Qiqi Tao,Jiaqi Lv,Na Zhao,Lei Feng,Joey Tianyi Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TokenSwap是一种针对大型视觉语言模型（LVLM）的隐蔽后门攻击方法，通过扰乱对象关系的理解而非固定目标内容，提高攻击的隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后门攻击方法容易被检测，因为模型会记住固定目标模式。TokenSwap旨在通过更隐蔽的方式攻击LVLM的组合理解能力。

Method: TokenSwap在训练时注入视觉触发器并交换文本答案中关键标记的语法角色，同时使用自适应标记加权损失强调学习交换后的标记。

Result: 实验表明，TokenSwap在多个基准测试和LVLM架构中实现了高攻击成功率，同时保持出色的隐蔽性和隐蔽性。

Conclusion: TokenSwap为LVLM后门攻击提供了一种更隐蔽和有效的方法，突显了模型在组合理解上的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to
backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim
model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or
replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are
relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such
frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on
these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce
TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the
compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed
targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object
relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate
outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their
relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap
injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the
grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However,
the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones,
making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address
this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly
emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and
bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior
evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM
architectures.

TL;DR: 构建联合面部-颅骨可变形模型，解决数据稀缺、配准精度不足及临床应用探索有限的问题，提出BFSM模型支持双向形状推断和医学应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部-颅骨数据稀缺、配准精度不足及临床应用中个体差异（如颅面畸形）被忽视的问题。

Method: 构建包含200多个样本的数据集，提出密集射线匹配配准方法，开发BFSM模型支持双向形状推断和组织厚度建模。

Result: BFSM模型在3D面部-颅骨重建和手术规划预测中表现出色，实验验证了其鲁棒性和准确性。

Conclusion: BFSM模型为医学应用提供了新工具，支持从单张图像重建面部-颅骨及预测手术效果。

Abstract: Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for
applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education,
and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is
constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient
registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical
applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often
overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To
address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200
samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each
case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured
face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method
that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue
correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull
Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and
skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness
variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull,
reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate
the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull
reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction. Extensive
experiments confirm the robustness and accuracy of our method. BFSM is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过构建大规模标注数据集并评估YOLOv11模型，展示了其在血液细胞检测中的高效性，尤其是Medium版本在性能和计算成本间的最佳平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动外周血涂片分析耗时且主观，深度学习提供了一种有前景的替代方案，但缺乏对YOLOv11等先进模型的系统性评估。

Method: 构建包含16,891张图像和298,850个标注细胞的数据集，评估五种YOLOv11变体在两种数据划分策略下的性能。

Result: YOLOv11 Medium版本在8:1:1数据划分下达到最佳平衡（mAP@0.5为0.934），且8:1:1划分优于7:2:1。

Conclusion: YOLOv11（尤其是Medium版本）是自动化外周血涂片检测的高效框架，公开数据集将推动血液细胞检测研究。

Abstract: Manual peripheral blood smear (PBS) analysis is labor intensive and
subjective. While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic
evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS
detection is still lacking. In this work, we make two key contributions. First,
we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and
classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC)
classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for
object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells.
Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five
YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously
benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and
systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean
Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational
efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the
best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger
models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially
higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms
the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11,
particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated,
fine grained PBS detection. Beyond benchmarking, our publicly released dataset
(github.com/Mohamad-AbouAli/OI-PBC-Dataset) offers a valuable resource to
advance research on blood cell detection and classification in hematology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于结构化最优传输（SOT）的无监督框架，用于精英标枪投掷动作的时序分割，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统运动分析依赖人工标注或实验室设备，耗时且难以扩展，需要自动化的时序分割方法。

Method: 结合结构化最优传输（SOT）与注意力时空图卷积网络（ASTGCN），实现无监督的动作阶段分割。

Result: 在测试数据上达到71.02%的平均精度（mAP）和74.61%的F1分数，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法无需人工标注即可识别动作阶段，并发布了新的标枪投掷视频数据集。

Abstract: Precise analysis of athletic motion is central to sports analytics,
particularly in disciplines where nuanced biomechanical phases directly impact
performance outcomes. Traditional analytics techniques rely on manual
annotation or laboratory-based instrumentation, which are time-consuming,
costly, and lack scalability. Automatic extraction of relevant kinetic
variables requires a robust and contextually appropriate temporal segmentation.
Considering the specific case of elite javelin-throw, we present a novel
unsupervised framework for such a contextually aware segmentation, which
applies the structured optimal transport (SOT) concept to augment the
well-known Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network
(ASTGCN). This enables the identification of motion phase transitions without
requiring expensive manual labeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, achieving 71.02%
mean average precision (mAP) and 74.61% F1-score on test data, substantially
higher than competing baselines. We also release a new dataset of 211 manually
annotated professional javelin-throw videos with frame-level annotations,
covering key biomechanical phases: approach steps, drive, throw, and recovery.

TL;DR: FreeRet是一个即插即用的框架，将多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）转化为两阶段检索器，无需额外训练即可实现高效检索和精确重排序。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现成的MLLMs是否可以作为强大的检索器，避免额外的训练成本。

Method: 通过语义嵌入和推理能力实现两阶段检索：快速候选搜索和精确重排序。

Result: 在46个数据集上显著优于需要大量训练的模型，支持多模态组合和端到端RAG。

Conclusion: 预训练的MLLMs经过合理利用，可以作为无需训练的强检索引擎，填补其作为通用模型的空白。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are emerging as versatile
foundations for mixed-modality retrieval. Yet, they often require heavy
post-hoc training to convert them into contrastive encoders for retrieval. This
work asks: Can off-the-shelf MLLMs serve as powerful retrievers without
additional training? We present FreeRet, a plug-and-play framework that turns
any MLLM into a two-stage retriever. FreeRet first derives semantically
grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then
exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes
three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically
faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit
priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing.
On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially
outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is
model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves
their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and
unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a
single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully
harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a
critical gap in their role as generalists.

TL;DR: SPLICE是一个基于COIN视频数据集的人类标注基准，用于评估事件推理能力，包括时间、因果、空间、上下文和常识推理。实验显示视觉语言模型（VLMs）在事件排序任务中表现远不如人类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索视觉语言模型在多维度事件推理任务中的表现，揭示其与人类能力的差距。

Method: 使用SPLICE数据集，包含3,381个视频和11,423个事件片段，评估人类和VLMs的事件排序能力。

Result: VLMs表现显著低于人类，依赖语言先验而非视觉理解。在时间因果推理任务中表现较好，但在上下文和空间推理中较差。

Conclusion: VLMs在视觉推理任务中仍有明显不足，尤其在复杂推理场景中表现不佳。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SPLICE, a human-curated benchmark derived from the
COIN instructional video dataset, designed to probe event-based reasoning
across multiple dimensions: temporal, causal, spatial, contextual, and general
knowledge. SPLICE includes 3,381 human-filtered videos spanning 12 categories
and 180 sub-categories, such as sports, engineering, and housework. These
videos are segmented into a total of 11,423 event clips. We evaluate both human
participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of
rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual
reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to
match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent
challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows
that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal
reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial
reasoning are dominant. They also perform better on everyday tasks than on
specialized ones.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的框架RIFLE，用于消除屏幕照片中的闪烁条纹（FB），并通过模拟数据和真实数据集验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 闪烁条纹（FB）严重影响屏幕照片的可读性和感知质量，但相关研究较少，因此需要一种专门的修复方法。

Method: 提出RIFLE框架，包括闪烁条纹先验估计器（FPE）和掩码损失（ML），并通过模拟管道生成合成数据。

Result: RIFLE在真实数据集上表现优于现有基线方法，尤其在严重闪烁条纹情况下。

Conclusion: 论文首次研究了FB的模拟与消除，为后续研究提供了数据集和模型设计的基础。

Abstract: Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs
of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is
alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between
a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation.
Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains
underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and
perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and
introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement,
RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine
details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key
banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally,
Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions
without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a
simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic
jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered
boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation.
For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned
banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics
and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently
outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe
flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research
the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for
subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model
design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种框架，将预训练的扩散模型适配为以对象为中心的合成方法，同时保留其生成能力，并在图像和视频中实现了先进的编辑和控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI中的一个核心目标是将场景表示为离散对象的组合，以实现细粒度和可控的图像与视频生成。现有的扩散模型以整体方式处理图像并依赖文本条件，导致对象级编辑不匹配。

Method: 通过轻量级的基于槽的条件化方法，将对象特定的控制集成到预训练模型中，保留其视觉先验。对于视频，使用不变槽注意力（ISA）和基于Transformer的时间聚合器来保持对象表示和动态的一致性。

Result: 在对象发现、分割、组合编辑和可控图像生成方面取得了最先进的结果，同时在无监督视频对象分割和重建中设定了新基准。

Conclusion: 该工作为图像和视频的对象中心生成建模提供了一种通用且可扩展的方法，扩展了交互式、结构化和用户驱动的生成工具的设计空间。

Abstract: A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete
objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet
leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text
conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis
introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for
object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity.
  We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with
disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based
conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while
providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments
diffusion models with a register token for background/style and
slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and
achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation,
compositional editing, and controllable image generation.
  We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention
(ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal
aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and
dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object
segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as
object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision.
  Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to
object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human
object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for
interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative,
scientific, and practical domains.

requiring substantially fewer parameters than conventional deep architectures.
VNODE consistently outperforms state of the art models with improved
computational complexity as exemplified on benchmark datasets like CIFAR10 and

Result: 在OVCamo基准测试中，cIoU从0.443提升至0.493，cSm从0.579提升至0.658，cMAE从0.336降至0.239。

Conclusion: 分类增强是提升伪装目标分割性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary camouflaged object segmentation requires models to segment
camouflaged objects of arbitrary categories unseen during training, placing
extremely high demands on generalization capabilities. Through analysis of
existing methods, it is observed that the classification component
significantly affects overall segmentation performance. Accordingly, a
classifier-centric adaptive framework is proposed to enhance segmentation
performance by improving the classification component via a lightweight text
adapter with a novel layered asymmetric initialization. Through the
classification enhancement, the proposed method achieves substantial
improvements in segmentation metrics compared to the OVCoser baseline on the
OVCamo benchmark: cIoU increases from 0.443 to 0.493, cSm from 0.579 to 0.658,
and cMAE reduces from 0.336 to 0.239. These results demonstrate that targeted
classification enhancement provides an effective approach for advancing
camouflaged object segmentation performance.

Conclusion: 该自动化分割管道在TBI病变分割中表现优异，代码已公开。

Abstract: The identification and segmentation of moderate-severe traumatic brain injury
(TBI) lesions pose a significant challenge in neuroimaging. This difficulty
arises from the extreme heterogeneity of these lesions, which vary in size,
number, and laterality, thereby complicating downstream image processing tasks
such as image registration and brain parcellation, reducing the analytical
accuracy. Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI
lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to
develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect
and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple
approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions. The core of our
pipeline leverages various architectures within the nnUNet framework for
initial segmentation, complemented by post-processing strategies to enhance
evaluation metrics. Our final submission to the challenge achieved an accuracy
of 0.8451, Dice score values of 0.4711 and 0.8514 for images with and without
visible lesions, respectively, with an overall Dice score of 0.5973, ranking
among the top-6 methods in the AIMS-TBI 2025 challenge. The Python

TL;DR: SANA-Video是一个小型扩散模型，能高效生成720x1280分辨率、长达一分钟的视频，具有快速生成、高质量和低成本的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成模型成本高、效率低的问题，提供一种低成本、高质量的视频生成方案。

Method: 采用线性注意力（Linear DiT）和恒定内存KV缓存技术，结合高效数据过滤和训练策略。

Result: 在RTX 5090 GPU上实现16倍速度提升，生成5秒720p视频时间从71秒缩短至29秒。

Conclusion: SANA-Video是一种低成本、高效的视频生成模型，性能优于同类小型扩散模型。

Abstract: We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently
generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration.
SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with
strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090
GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video
generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation,
which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens
processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear
Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video
generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative
properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with
global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional
KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we
explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the
training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of
MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance
compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B
and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover,
SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating
the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x
speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video
generation.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖大规模文本-视频数据集隐式学习物理推理，成本高且易产生违反物理规律的运动。

Method: 采用轻量级物理感知推理管道构建反事实提示，并提出同步解耦引导策略（SDG）来抑制不合理内容。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了物理合理性，同时保持照片级真实感，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 提出了一种即插即用的物理感知视频生成新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion models can generate realistic videos, but existing methods rely on
implicitly learning physical reasoning from large-scale text-video datasets,
which is costly, difficult to scale, and still prone to producing implausible
motions that violate fundamental physical laws. We introduce a training-free
framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly
reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to
construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating
behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG)
strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional
normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled
denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible
content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising.
Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach
substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism,
despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the
complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and
SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually
validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content
and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and
plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了IWR-Bench，一个用于评估大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在交互式网页重建任务中表现的新基准，揭示了当前模型在动态交互推理和代码生成方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注静态截图到代码的任务，忽略了真实网页应用中的动态交互，因此需要一个新的基准来评估模型在这方面的能力。

Method: 提出了IWR-Bench基准，包含113个任务，涵盖多样化的交互复杂性和视觉风格，并采用代理作为评判框架和综合指标系统自动评估生成网页的功能正确性和视觉保真度。

Result: 在28个LVLMs上的实验表明，最佳模型的总体得分仅为36.35%，功能正确性（24.39%）显著低于视觉保真度（64.25%）。

Conclusion: IWR-Bench揭示了当前模型在时间动态推理和事件驱动逻辑合成方面的局限性，为视觉语言研究提供了一个具有挑战性的前沿基准。

Abstract: The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations
of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks
primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the
dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address
this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for
evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113
meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and
featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles,
and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task
includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets
(e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental
challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from
video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into
functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric
system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of
generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant
challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as
functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity
(64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models'
ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic,
establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research.
The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is

<details>

Motivation: 现有医学VLM在多样成像模态和多语言临床数据上受限，限制了其通用性和临床实用性。

Method: 引入包含156万对CT-PET图像和2757份完整临床报告的越南语数据集，并提出数据增强和专家验证的训练框架。

Result: 实验表明，该数据集显著提升了现有VLM在医学报告生成和视觉问答任务中的性能。

Conclusion: 该数据集和基准测试将推动医学影像VLM的发展，特别是在低资源语言中，并提升其在越南医疗中的临床相关性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs), trained on large-scale multimodal
datasets, have driven significant advances in Artificial Intelligence by
enabling rich cross-modal reasoning. Despite their success in general domains,
applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited
availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most
existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus
primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and
clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired
CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This
dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1)
the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which
hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks;
and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the
Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report
pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs'
learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We
conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on
downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question
answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset
significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this
dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development
of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource
languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有双模态跟踪方法在复杂场景中表现有限，需要更多模态以增强鲁棒性。

Method: 构建了RGBDT500数据集，并提出RDTTrack跟踪器，通过正交投影约束融合三模态信息。

Result: 实验表明，RDTTrack在复杂场景中显著优于现有双模态方法。

Conclusion: 多模态融合显著提升了跟踪性能，尤其在复杂场景中。

Abstract: Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal
paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex
scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work
introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary
modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR),
aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we
construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists
of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame
provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise
object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal
tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust
tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning
techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities
under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with
RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model,
effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing
significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of
tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在资源受限环境中的存储和传输成本高的问题。

Method: UGC进行无重优化剪枝，GaussPainter利用扩散先验和掩码引导细化恢复高质量渲染。

Result: 实现100倍压缩（354.77 MB降至3.31 MB），保持保真度并提升图像质量。

Conclusion: 扩散先验在极端压缩与高质量神经渲染之间起到关键作用。

Abstract: Neural scene representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), have
enabled high-quality neural rendering; however, their large storage and
transmission costs hinder deployment in resource-constrained environments.
Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow
and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which
degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent
data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this
trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering
quality. We introduce \textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that
unifies \textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with
\textbf{GaussPainter} for \textbf{Ex}treme 3D\textbf{GS} compression.
\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce
Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas
\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided
refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian
scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing
regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in
degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a
one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can
even achieve over $100\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model
to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image
quality under challenging conditions. These results highlight the central role
of diffusion priors in bridging the gap between extreme compression and
high-quality neural rendering. Our code repository will be released at

Conclusion: VTPerception-R1为感知基础的多模态推理提供了可扩展且可审计的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often struggle to ground reasoning
in perceptual evidence. We present a systematic study of perception
strategies-explicit, implicit, visual, and textual-across four multimodal
benchmarks and two MLLMs. Our findings show that explicit perception,
especially when paired with textual cues, consistently yields the best
improvements, particularly for smaller models. Based on this insight, we
propose VTPerception-R1, a unified two-stage framework that decouples
perception from reasoning. Stage 1 introduces perception-augmented fine-tuning,
and Stage 2 applies perception-aware reinforcement learning with novel visual,
textual, and consistency rewards. Experiments demonstrate that VTPerception-R1
significantly improves reasoning accuracy and robustness across diverse tasks,
offering a scalable and auditable solution for perception-grounded multimodal
reasoning. Our code is available at:

Conclusion: SkyLink方法在多样城市场景中表现出鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims at establishing location correspondences
between different viewpoints. Existing approaches typically learn cross-view
correlations through direct feature similarity matching, often overlooking
semantic degradation caused by extreme viewpoint disparities. To address this
unique problem, we focus on robust feature retrieval under viewpoint variation
and propose the novel SkyLink method. We firstly utilize the Google Retrieval
Enhancement Module to perform data enhancement on street images, which
mitigates the occlusion of the key target due to restricted street viewpoints.
The Patch-Aware Feature Aggregation module is further adopted to emphasize
multiple local feature aggregations to ensure the consistent feature extraction
across viewpoints. Meanwhile, we integrate the 3D scene information constructed
from multi-scale UAV images as a bridge between street and satellite
viewpoints, and perform feature alignment through self-supervised and
cross-view contrastive learning. Experimental results demonstrate robustness
and generalization across diverse urban scenarios, which achieve 25.75$\%$
Recall@1 accuracy on University-1652 in the UAVM2025 Challenge. Code will be

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解中，均匀帧采样机制无法兼顾时空信息，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出LOVE-R1模型，采用多步推理自适应缩放机制，结合强化学习优化。

Result: 在4个基准测试中平均提升3.1%，优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 自适应帧采样机制有效平衡时空信息，提升长视频理解性能。

Abstract: Long video understanding is still challenging for recent Large Video-Language
Models (LVLMs) due to the conflict between long-form temporal understanding and
detailed spatial perception. LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism,
which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate,
inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in
suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model
that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with
densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are
needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame
resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The
whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the
reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k
high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning.
As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we
decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize
the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video
understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame
sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and
frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an
average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.

Motivation: 探索MLLMs中视觉功能的分布规律，以优化模型设计和下游应用。

Method: 采用Visual Token Swapping框架分析层功能，并提出VFL-LoRA和VFL-select方法。

Result: VFL-LoRA优于全参数微调，VFL-select仅需20%数据达到98%性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs视觉处理机制，为高效、可解释模型设计提供新思路。

Abstract: This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed
across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).
Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition,
narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers
(VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a
consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human
behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then
grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel
analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely
elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights
offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream
applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs
whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform
full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by
analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs
are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling
highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities.
Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and
achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset.
This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering
the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优异，Pendulum上MAE降低91%，ADNI上FID降低87%。

Conclusion: Causal-Adapter实现了鲁棒、可推广的反事实编辑，具有高保真属性修改和身份保持能力。

Abstract: We present Causal-Adapter, a modular framework that adapts frozen
text-to-image diffusion backbones for counterfactual image generation. Our
method enables causal interventions on target attributes, consistently
propagating their effects to causal dependents without altering the core
identity of the image. In contrast to prior approaches that rely on prompt
engineering without explicit causal structure, Causal-Adapter leverages
structural causal modeling augmented with two attribute regularization
strategies: prompt-aligned injection, which aligns causal attributes with
textual embeddings for precise semantic control, and a conditioned token
contrastive loss to disentangle attribute factors and reduce spurious
correlations. Causal-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real-world datasets, with up to 91\% MAE reduction on Pendulum
for accurate attribute control and 87\% FID reduction on ADNI for high-fidelity
MRI image generation. These results show that our approach enables robust,
generalizable counterfactual editing with faithful attribute modification and
strong identity preservation.

Motivation: 3D物体分类在实际应用中非常重要，但点云的无序性和噪声使得高精度分类仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: TACO-Net在3D物体分类中实现了新的SOTA，并展示了强大的抗噪能力。

Abstract: 3D object classification is a crucial problem due to its significant
practical relevance in many fields, including computer vision, robotics, and
autonomous driving. Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds
sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras
have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification
accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and
their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art
(SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data
analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they
are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a
voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features. Next,
we train a lightweight one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D CNN)
using the extracted feature set from the training dataset. Our framework,
TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\%$ and $99.52\%$
accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and
further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D
dataset. When tested with ten different kinds of corrupted ModelNet40 inputs,
the proposed TACO-Net demonstrates strong resiliency overall.

Motivation: 现有方法需要“干净”的输入（如全身图像或校准良好的多视角图像），而UP2You旨在直接处理原始、无结构的照片，适应各种姿态、视角和遮挡。

Method: 引入数据校正器范式，将无约束输入转换为干净的正交多视角图像；提出姿态相关特征聚合模块（PCFA）和多参考形状预测器。

Result: 在几何精度（Chamfer-15%）和纹理保真度（PSNR-21%）上优于现有方法，效率高（1.5分钟/人），支持无训练的多服装3D虚拟试穿。

Conclusion: UP2You在无约束照片的3D重建任务中表现出色，具有高效性和实用性，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: We present UP2You, the first tuning-free solution for reconstructing
high-fidelity 3D clothed portraits from extremely unconstrained in-the-wild 2D
photos. Unlike previous approaches that require "clean" inputs (e.g., full-body
images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You
directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly
in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into
tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier
paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal
multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D
reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation
module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference
images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly
constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a
perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for
pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and
in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous
methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and
texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5
minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and
training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for
real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured. Both models and code
will be released to facilitate future research on this underexplored task.

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，剪枝94.4%的token仍保持精度，推理速度提升2.30倍。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需训练，显著提升了视觉语言模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable strong multimodal reasoning but
incur heavy inference costs from redundant visual tokens. Token pruning
alleviates this issue, yet existing approaches face limitations.
Attention-based methods rely on raw attention scores, which are often unstable
across layers and heads and can lead to redundant selections. Diversity-based
methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but
risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \ours, a
training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher
sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should
also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To
achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at
the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the
model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the
projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through
lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments
across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \ours consistently outperforms
prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and
significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end
inference over the baseline.

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) measurement enables non-contact
physiological monitoring but suffers from accuracy degradation under head
motion and illumination changes. Existing deep learning methods are mostly
heuristic and lack theoretical grounding, which limits robustness and
interpretability. In this work, we propose a physics-informed rPPG paradigm
derived from the Navier-Stokes equations of hemodynamics, showing that the
pulse signal follows a second-order dynamical system whose discrete solution
naturally leads to a causal convolution. This provides a theoretical
justification for using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). Based on this
principle, we design PHASE-Net, a lightweight model with three key components:
(1) Zero-FLOPs Axial Swapper module, which swaps or transposes a few spatial
channels to mix distant facial regions and enhance cross-region feature
interaction without breaking temporal order; (2) Adaptive Spatial Filter, which
learns a soft spatial mask per frame to highlight signal-rich areas and
suppress noise; and (3) Gated TCN, a causal dilated TCN with gating that models
long-range temporal dynamics for accurate pulse recovery. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PHASE-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong
efficiency, offering a theoretically grounded and deployment-ready rPPG
solution.

Result: 在MODMA数据集上达到97.63%准确率和97.33% F1分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ELPG-DTFS为下一代基于EEG的抑郁症诊断提供了鲁棒且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Timely and objective screening of major depressive disorder (MDD) is vital,
yet diagnosis still relies on subjective scales. Electroencephalography (EEG)
provides a low-cost biomarker, but existing deep models treat spectra as static
images, fix inter-channel graphs, and ignore prior knowledge, limiting accuracy
and interpretability. We propose ELPG-DTFS, a prior-guided adaptive
time-frequency graph neural network that introduces: (1) channel-band attention
with cross-band mutual information, (2) a learnable adjacency matrix for
dynamic functional links, and (3) a residual knowledge-graph pathway injecting
neuroscience priors. On the 128-channel MODMA dataset (53 subjects), ELPG-DTFS
achieves 97.63% accuracy and 97.33% F1, surpassing the 2025 state-of-the-art
ACM-GNN. Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35,
confirming their complementary value. ELPG-DTFS thus offers a robust and
interpretable framework for next-generation EEG-based MDD diagnostics.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于生物视觉机制的预处理方法，通过DoG滤波增强局部对比度，提升语义分割模型在恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类视觉系统的对比增强和颜色对立机制启发，探索生物启发的输入预处理方法，以提升语义分割的鲁棒性。

Method: 在RGB、灰度和对立颜色通道上应用DoG滤波，增强局部对比度，无需修改模型架构或训练过程。

Result: 在Cityscapes、ACDC和Dark Zurich数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保持正常条件下性能的同时，显著提升了在夜间、雾天和雪天等恶劣条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这种轻量级且模型无关的预处理方法，有望集成到成像系统中，为安全关键环境下的下游视觉任务提供鲁棒的输入。

Abstract: Inspired by the human visual system's mechanisms for contrast enhancement and
color-opponency, we explore biologically motivated input preprocessing for
robust semantic segmentation. By applying Difference-of-Gaussians (DoG)
filtering to RGB, grayscale, and opponent-color channels, we enhance local
contrast without modifying model architecture or training. Evaluations on
Cityscapes, ACDC, and Dark Zurich show that such preprocessing maintains
in-distribution performance while improving robustness to adverse conditions
like night, fog, and snow. As this processing is model-agnostic and
lightweight, it holds potential for integration into imaging pipelines,
enabling imaging systems to deliver task-ready, robust inputs for downstream
vision models in safety-critical environments.

TL;DR: StreamForest是一种专为实时流视频理解设计的新架构，通过Persistent Event Memory Forest和Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window提升性能，并在多个基准测试中达到最优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM在实时流视频场景中因存储限制和时空推理不足而表现不佳。

Method: 提出StreamForest架构，包括事件记忆森林和细粒度时空窗口，结合OnlineIT数据集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最优，压缩条件下仍保持高精度。

Conclusion: StreamForest在实时视频理解中展现出鲁棒性、高效性和通用性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently achieved remarkable
progress in video understanding. However, their effectiveness in real-time
streaming scenarios remains limited due to storage constraints of historical
visual features and insufficient real-time spatiotemporal reasoning. To address
these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically
designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the
Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes
video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided
by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge
frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited
computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a
Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual
cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an
instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT
significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future
prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce
ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding
in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that
StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of
77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In
particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024
tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks
relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness,
efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video
understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在遥感领域应用中存在环境上下文有限、数据缺失或损坏、用户意图反映不足等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出了一种条件扩散模型，结合动态环境条件和元数据融合策略，支持多模态控制信号输入。

Result: 在单图像和时间序列生成任务中，新方法在质量和定量指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 环境上下文条件化能提升卫星图像生成模型的性能，新模型适用于下游任务，并发布了首个多模态公开数据集。

Abstract: Diffusion-based foundation models have recently garnered much attention in
the field of generative modeling due to their ability to generate images of
high quality and fidelity. Although not straightforward, their recent
application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials
towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing
multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face
considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle
with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user
intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion
model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite
images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals:
a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the
proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition
satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its
control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models
attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or
missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both
qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control
inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of
generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image
and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that
conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation
models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for
usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge,
the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different
mediums.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共数据集中严重的类别不平衡问题抑制了稀有类别的识别性能，因此需要研究如何提升车辆类型识别的准确性。

Method: 通过合并Kaggle、ImageNet和网络爬取数据构建了一个16类数据集，并采用SMOTE过采样和针对性欠采样生成六种平衡变体。比较了轻量级集成模型（如Random Forest、AdaBoost）和基于MobileNet-V2特征的软投票组合器，以及一个可配置的ResNet风格CNN。

Result: 最佳集成模型（SMOTE组合）测试准确率为74.8%，CNN在完整测试集上达到79.19%，在未见推理批次上达到81.25%。但最稀有类别（Barge）仍表现不佳。

Conclusion: 建议优先收集更多少数类数据，采用成本敏感目标（如焦点损失），并探索混合集成或CNN管道以结合可解释性和表征能力。

Abstract: Accurate vehicle type recognition underpins intelligent transportation and
logistics, but severe class imbalance in public datasets suppresses performance
on rare categories. We curate a 16-class corpus (~47k images) by merging
Kaggle, ImageNet, and web-crawled data, and create six balanced variants via
SMOTE oversampling and targeted undersampling. Lightweight ensembles, such as
Random Forest, AdaBoost, and a soft-voting combiner built on MobileNet-V2
features are benchmarked against a configurable ResNet-style CNN trained with
strong augmentation and label smoothing. The best ensemble (SMOTE-combined)
attains 74.8% test accuracy, while the CNN achieves 79.19% on the full test set
and 81.25% on an unseen inference batch, confirming the advantage of deep
models. Nonetheless, the most under-represented class (Barge) remains a failure
mode, highlighting the limits of rebalancing alone. Results suggest
prioritizing additional minority-class collection and cost-sensitive objectives
(e.g., focal loss) and exploring hybrid ensemble or CNN pipelines to combine
interpretability with representational power.

TL;DR: MMRQA框架结合多模态大语言模型和信号处理，解决了MRI质量评估中的数据稀缺和协议多变问题，实现了高性能和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MRI质量评估方法在定量指标和语义理解之间存在权衡，MMRQA旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: MMRQA通过模拟伪影增强的MRQy提取指标，用Qwen转化为问答对，并通过LoRA高效融合LLaVA-OneVision。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，MMRQA表现出色，具有强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: MMRQA通过结合定量分析和语义推理，生成了临床可解释的输出，提升了动态医疗环境中的质量控制。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) quality assessment is crucial for clinical
decision-making, yet remains challenging due to data scarcity and protocol
variability. Traditional approaches face fundamental trade-offs: signal-based
methods like MRIQC provide quantitative metrics but lack semantic
understanding, while deep learning approaches achieve high accuracy but
sacrifice interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce the
Multimodal MRI Quality Assessment (MMRQA) framework, pioneering the integration
of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with acquisition-aware signal
processing. MMRQA combines three key innovations: robust metric extraction via
MRQy augmented with simulated artifacts, structured transformation of metrics
into question-answer pairs using Qwen, and parameter-efficient fusion through
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of LLaVA-OneVision. Evaluated on MR-ART, FastMRI,
and MyConnectome benchmarks, MMRQA achieves state-of-the-art performance with
strong zero-shot generalization, as validated by comprehensive ablation
studies. By bridging quantitative analysis with semantic reasoning, our
framework generates clinically interpretable outputs that enhance quality
control in dynamic medical settings.

*Mostafa Mohaimen Akand Faisal,Rabeya Amin Jhuma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VagueGAN是一种针对生成模型的攻击方法，通过隐空间扰动实现目标输出变化，同时保持视觉隐蔽性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究生成模型（如GAN和扩散模型）在输入微小扰动下输出可控变化的攻击方法。

Method: 结合PoisonerNet和生成器-判别器对，设计隐蔽触发器，评估攻击效果和隐蔽性。

Result: 攻击不仅有效，还能提升输出视觉质量，挑战传统防御假设。

Conclusion: 隐空间扰动暴露了像素级防御的盲区，对生成模型的安全性提出新挑战。

Abstract: Generative models such as GANs and diffusion models are widely used to
synthesize photorealistic images and to support downstream creative and editing
tasks. While adversarial attacks on discriminative models are well studied,
attacks targeting generative pipelines where small, stealthy perturbations in
inputs lead to controlled changes in outputs are less explored. This study
introduces VagueGAN, an attack pipeline combining a modular perturbation
network PoisonerNet with a Generator Discriminator pair to craft stealthy
triggers that cause targeted changes in generated images. Attack efficacy is
evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through
perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to
a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided
editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display
higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the
assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional
pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion
pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot
in pixel level defenses. Moreover, carefully optimized perturbations can
produce consistent, stealthy effects on generator outputs while remaining
visually inconspicuous, raising concerns for the integrity of image generation
pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图下的3D重建存在过拟合、几何失真和场景恢复不完整的问题，3D高斯溅射在稀疏输入下也有浮动伪影和结构不一致的缺陷。

Method: DWGS引入混合损失深度估计模块、双向变形虚拟视图合成方法和遮挡感知重建组件，增强多视图一致性和几何约束。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，DWGS达到21.13 dB PSNR和0.189 LPIPS，性能最优且保持实时推理能力。

Conclusion: DWGS通过创新方法解决了稀疏视图合成的核心挑战，显著提升了渲染质量和一致性。

Abstract: Novel View Synthesis (NVS) from sparse views remains a core challenge in 3D
reconstruction, typically suffering from overfitting, geometric distortion, and
incomplete scene recovery due to limited multi-view constraints. Although 3D
Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time, high-fidelity rendering, it
suffers from floating artifacts and structural inconsistencies under
sparse-input settings. To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel
unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating
robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region
completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a
Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with
reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce
multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method
generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric
constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes
depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured
regions. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks (LLFF, Blender, and DTU)
show that DWGS achieves a new state-of-the-art, achieving up to 21.13 dB PSNR
and 0.189 LPIPS, while retaining real-time inference capabilities.

TL;DR: DAM框架通过结合视觉语言模型和主动学习，提升无源域适应的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能有效融合视觉语言模型和数据监督，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出DAM框架，利用双向蒸馏机制整合多模态监督和稀疏人工标注。

Result: DAM在多个SFADA基准和主动学习策略中表现最优。

Conclusion: DAM通过双监督信号和双向蒸馏，显著提升了无源域适应的效果。

Abstract: Source-free active domain adaptation (SFADA) enhances knowledge transfer from
a source model to an unlabeled target domain using limited manual labels
selected via active learning. While recent domain adaptation studies have
introduced Vision-and-Language (ViL) models to improve pseudo-label quality or
feature alignment, they often treat ViL-based and data supervision as separate
sources, lacking effective fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose Dual
Active learning with Multimodal (DAM) foundation model, a novel framework that
integrates multimodal supervision from a ViL model to complement sparse human
annotations, thereby forming a dual supervisory signal. DAM initializes stable
ViL-guided targets and employs a bidirectional distillation mechanism to foster
mutual knowledge exchange between the target model and the dual supervisions
during iterative adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAM
consistently outperforms existing methods and sets a new state-of-the-art
across multiple SFADA benchmarks and active learning strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的青少年特发性脊柱侧弯（AIS）评估框架，结合HRNet和Swin-Transformer模块，通过生物力学约束增强特征提取，并引入椎体楔形指数（VWI）作为新的量化指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Cobb角测量存在观察者变异性，且现有自动化方法简化了脊柱模型，无法应对临床复杂性。

Method: 使用HRNet骨干网络和Swin-Transformer模块，结合生物力学约束，通过奇异值分解（SVD）分析椎体形态，预测上下终板角度和中点坐标。

Result: 在630张全脊柱前后位X光片上达到83.45%的诊断准确率和2.55°的平均绝对误差，VWI与曲线进展显著相关。

Conclusion: 该方法在AIS评估中表现出色，VWI为早期检测和个性化治疗提供了新工具。

Abstract: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a common spinal deformity affecting
approximately 2.2% of boys and 4.8% of girls worldwide. The Cobb angle serves
as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual
measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use
simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address
clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS
assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate
angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving
the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach
combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically
informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral
morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without
predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs
from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method
achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\deg} mean absolute error. The
framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on
out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging
Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal
analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve
progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing
robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and
progression monitoring.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Attention Surgery的高效框架，用于在预训练的视频扩散模型中实现线性或混合注意力，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer-based视频扩散模型（VDMs）虽然生成质量高，但自注意力的二次计算成本限制了其在长序列和高分辨率上的应用。线性注意力虽能降低复杂度，但现有方法难以在不重新训练的情况下匹配softmax注意力的表现。

Method: 结合了混合注意力机制（softmax和线性令牌混合）和轻量级蒸馏与微调流程，仅需少量GPU天即可完成。还引入了成本感知的块率策略以平衡各层的表现力和效率。

Result: 在Wan2.1 1.3B模型上，Attention Surgery实现了首个具有竞争力的次二次注意力视频扩散模型，FLOPs降低40%，同时保持生成质量。

Conclusion: Attention Surgery为视频扩散模型提供了一种高效且无需从头训练的注意力优化方案，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Transformer-based video diffusion models (VDMs) deliver state-of-the-art
video generation quality but are constrained by the quadratic cost of
self-attention, making long sequences and high resolutions computationally
expensive. While linear attention offers sub-quadratic complexity, prior
attempts fail to match the expressiveness of softmax attention without costly
retraining. We introduce \textit{Attention Surgery}, an efficient framework for
\textit{linearizing} or \textit{hybridizing} attention in pretrained VDMs
without training from scratch. Inspired by recent advances in language models,
our method combines a novel hybrid attention mechanism-mixing softmax and
linear tokens-with a lightweight distillation and fine-tuning pipeline
requiring only a few GPU-days. Additionally, we incorporate a cost-aware
block-rate strategy to balance expressiveness and efficiency across layers.
Applied to Wan2.1 1.3B, a state-of-the-art DiT-based VDM, Attention Surgery
achieves the first competitive sub-quadratic attention video diffusion models,
reducing attention cost by up to 40\% in terms of FLOPs, while maintaining
generation quality as measured on the standard VBench and VBench-2.0
benchmarks.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，模型性能显著提升（编辑任务最高18%，生成任务13%）。

Conclusion: 系统化数据构建是提升多模态AI能力的关键。

Abstract: The performance of unified multimodal models for image generation and editing
is fundamentally constrained by the quality and comprehensiveness of their
training data. While existing datasets have covered basic tasks like style
transfer and simple object manipulation, they often lack the systematic
structure and challenging scenarios required for real-world applications. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce OpenGPT-4o-Image, a large-scale dataset
constructed using a novel methodology that combines hierarchical task taxonomy
with automated data generation. Our taxonomy not only includes fundamental
capabilities such as text rendering and style control but also introduces
highly practical yet challenging categories like scientific imagery for
chemistry illustrations and complex instruction editing requiring simultaneous
execution of multiple operations. Through an automated pipeline leveraging
structured resource pools and GPT-4o, we generate 80k high-quality
instruction-image pairs with controlled diversity, covering 11 major domains
and 51 subtasks. Extensive experiments show that fine-tuning leading models on
our dataset achieves significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks,
with improvements of up to 18\% on editing tasks (UniWorld-V1 on ImgEdit-Bench)
and 13% on generation tasks (Harmon on GenEval). Our work demonstrates that
systematic data construction is key to advancing multimodal AI capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖最短路径轨迹，缺乏有效的探索先验，限制了导航代理的性能。

Method: SID首先在最短路径数据上训练初始代理，然后利用该代理生成新的探索轨迹，通过迭代自我改进提升性能。

Result: SID在多种语言引导导航任务中表现优异，特别是在SOON验证集上达到50.9%的成功率，领先先前方法13.9%。

Conclusion: SID通过自我改进的演示显著提升了导航代理的探索能力和泛化性能，成为目标导向语言导航任务的新标杆。

Abstract: Goal-oriented language-guided navigation requires robust exploration
capabilities for agents to navigate to specified goals in unknown environments
without step-by-step instructions. Existing methods tend to exclusively utilize
shortest-path trajectories, lacking effective exploration priors for training
navigation agents. To address the above challenges, we present SID, a
goal-oriented language-guided navigation learning approach with Self-Improving
Demonstrations. Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path
data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel
exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with
stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces
higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show
that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments,
and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of
language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse
goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID
significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of
navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art
performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including
REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation
splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.

Result: 成功生成逼真的胸部X光片，并在冠状动脉疾病建模中表现良好。

Conclusion: Seg-CFT简化了结构特定干预，同时保持了局部一致性和有效性。

Abstract: Counterfactual image generation is a powerful tool for augmenting training
data, de-biasing datasets, and modeling disease. Current approaches rely on
external classifiers or regressors to increase the effectiveness of
subject-level interventions (e.g., changing the patient's age). For
structure-specific interventions (e.g., changing the area of the left lung in a
chest radiograph), we show that this is insufficient, and can result in
undesirable global effects across the image domain. Previous work used
pixel-level label maps as guidance, requiring a user to provide hypothetical
segmentations which are tedious and difficult to obtain. We propose
Segmentor-guided Counterfactual Fine-Tuning (Seg-CFT), which preserves the
simplicity of intervening on scalar-valued, structure-specific variables while
producing locally coherent and effective counterfactuals. We demonstrate the
capability of generating realistic chest radiographs, and we show promising
results for modeling coronary artery disease. Code:

Motivation: 探索GANs的可扩展性，借鉴其他生成模型的设计选择，以提升训练效率和性能。

Method: 在变分自编码器（VAE）的潜在空间中训练，采用纯Transformer结构的生成器和判别器，并引入轻量级中间监督和宽度感知学习率调整。

Abstract: Scalability has driven recent advances in generative modeling, yet its
principles remain underexplored for adversarial learning. We investigate the
scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design
choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models:
training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely
transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space
enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this
efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales
with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes
that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as
underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability
as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly
solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate
adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and
latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of
capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art
single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on
ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.

*Jiahua Li,Kun Wei,Zhe Xu,Zibo Su,Xu Yang,Cheng Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogniGPT通过多粒度感知和验证增强的交互循环，高效可靠地理解长视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频具有时间复杂性和稀疏的任务相关信息，现有LLM方法难以兼顾完整性和效率。

Method: 提出CogniGPT框架，结合多粒度感知代理（MGPA）和验证增强反思代理（VERA）的交互循环。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如EgoSchema上仅用11.2帧超越现有无训练方法。

Conclusion: CogniGPT通过仿人类渐进认知的交互机制，实现了高效可靠的长视频理解。

Abstract: Long videos, characterized by temporal complexity and sparse task-relevant
information, pose significant reasoning challenges for AI systems. Although
various Large Language Model (LLM)-based approaches have advanced long video
understanding, they still struggle to achieve both completeness and efficiency
in capturing task-critical information. Inspired by human progressive visual
cognition, we propose CogniGPT, a framework that leverages an interactive loop
between Multi-Granular Perception Agent (MGPA) and Verification-Enhanced
Reflection Agent (VERA) for efficient and reliable long video understanding.
Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to
capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to
mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through
this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and
reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME,
NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both
accuracy and efficiency. Notably, on EgoSchema, it surpasses existing
training-free methods using only 11.2 frames and achieves performance
comparable to Gemini 1.5-Pro.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了温度缩放（TS）在提高卷积神经网络（CNN）对脑肿瘤分类可靠性方面的有效性，结果表明TS能显著降低校准误差和负对数似然，而不影响分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗影像等高风险领域，深度学习模型的置信度估计至关重要，过度自信的误分类可能导致严重后果。

Method: 开发了自定义CNN，并在合并的脑MRI数据集上训练，引入五种噪声模拟现实不确定性，使用TS进行后处理校准。

Result: TS在所有噪声条件下显著降低了ECE和NLL，且未降低分类准确性。

Conclusion: TS是一种高效且计算成本低的方法，可提升医疗AI系统的决策置信度，使其在噪声或不确定环境中更可靠。

Abstract: Precise confidence estimation in deep learning is vital for high-stakes
fields like medical imaging, where overconfident misclassifications can have
serious consequences. This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature
Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop
a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world
uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt
& Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision,
recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected
calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate
that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without
degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and
computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI
systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain
settings.

TL;DR: 提出了Social 3D Scene Graphs，一种增强的3D场景图表示，用于捕捉人类及其与环境的关系，并引入新基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图方法忽略了人类及其与环境的关系，且仅从单帧图像中捕捉开放词汇关系，限制了长程交互建模。

Method: 提出Social 3D Scene Graphs，扩展3D场景图以包含人类属性、活动及环境关系，采用开放词汇框架。

Result: 实验表明，该表示提升了人类活动预测和人与环境关系推理能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为社交智能机器人奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is
essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware
ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation
for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the
scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships.
Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations
from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range
interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs,
an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their
attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and
remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new
benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene
relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social
scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation
improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment
relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨模态融合注意力（CMFA）和自监督多事件表示学习（SSMER）的新框架，用于事件相机的面部关键点对齐，解决了现有方法在事件数据上表现不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在低光和快速运动等挑战性条件下具有优势，但现有RGB方法在事件数据上表现不佳，且缺乏标记数据集。

Method: 使用CMFA整合RGB数据指导特征提取，并通过SSMER从无标签事件数据中学习特征。

Result: 在真实事件数据集E-SIE和合成事件数据集WFLW-V上，方法在多指标上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了事件相机面部关键点对齐的性能，解决了数据不足和空间信息有限的问题。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages for facial keypoint alignment under
challenging conditions, such as low light and rapid motion, due to their high
temporal resolution and robustness to varying illumination. However, existing
RGB facial keypoint alignment methods do not perform well on event data, and
training solely on event data often leads to suboptimal performance because of
its limited spatial information. Moreover, the lack of comprehensive labeled
event datasets further hinders progress in this area. To address these issues,
we propose a novel framework based on cross-modal fusion attention (CMFA) and
self-supervised multi-event representation learning (SSMER) for event-based
facial keypoint alignment. Our framework employs CMFA to integrate
corresponding RGB data, guiding the model to extract robust facial features
from event input images. In parallel, SSMER enables effective feature learning
from unlabeled event data, overcoming spatial limitations. Extensive
experiments on our real-event E-SIE dataset and a synthetic-event version of
the public WFLW-V benchmark show that our approach consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Motivation: 解决脑胶质瘤分割任务中数据多样性不足和存储大量增强数据的高计算成本问题。

Method: 使用预训练的生成对抗网络（GliGANs）动态生成合成肿瘤，结合nnU-Net框架训练三种模型并集成。

Result: 在BraTS 2025验证平台上，模型在多个指标上表现优异，最终排名第一。

Conclusion: 动态数据增强策略有效提升了模型性能，为脑胶质瘤分割任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robust segmentation across both pre-treatment and post-treatment glioma scans
can be helpful for consistent tumor monitoring and treatment planning. BraTS
2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying
tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such
generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data,
which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing
large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address
these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that
dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial
networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and
their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular
on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly
augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages
pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior
challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves
lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH),
0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform. This
work ranked first in the BraTS Lighthouse Challenge 2025 Task 1- Adult Glioma

Motivation: 现有方法常忽视视觉质量，限制了实际应用。

Method: 设计了一个有效的变分自编码器（VAE），将alpha通道编码到RGB潜在空间，并构建了高质量的RGBA视频数据集。

Result: 模型在视觉质量、运动真实感和透明度渲染方面表现优异，能生成多种半透明对象和精细细节。

Conclusion: Wan-Alpha在RGBA视频生成中表现出色，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: RGBA video generation, which includes an alpha channel to represent
transparency, is gaining increasing attention across a wide range of
applications. However, existing methods often neglect visual quality, limiting
their practical usability. In this paper, we propose \textit{Wan-Alpha}, a new
framework that generates transparent videos by learning both RGB and alpha
channels jointly. We design an effective variational autoencoder (VAE) that
encodes the alpha channel into the RGB latent space. Then, to support the
training of our diffusion transformer, we construct a high-quality and diverse
RGBA video dataset. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, our model
demonstrates superior performance in visual quality, motion realism, and
transparency rendering. Notably, our model can generate a wide variety of
semi-transparent objects, glowing effects, and fine-grained details such as
hair strands. The released model is available on our website:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDPose是一个基于Stable Diffusion的微调框架，用于人体姿态估计，通过保留生成先验和轻量级卷积头实现跨域鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练扩散模型在结构化输出（如人体姿态估计）中的潜力，现有方法对此研究不足。

Method: 直接在SD U-Net的潜在空间预测关键点热图，通过轻量级卷积头映射特征，并加入RGB重建分支增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在COCO验证集上与Sapiens-1B/2B持平，在跨域基准HumanArt和COCO-OOD上达到新SOTA。

Conclusion: SDPose不仅作为姿态估计器表现优异，还能用于下游可控生成任务，提供高质量的姿态引导。

Abstract: Pre-trained diffusion models provide rich multi-scale latent features and are
emerging as powerful vision backbones. While recent works such as
Marigold~\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\citep{he2024lotus} adapt
diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization,
their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning
framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion
priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention
modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint
heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original
generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps
through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the
pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance
out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction
branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate
robustness under domain shift, we further construct \textbf{COCO-OOD}, a
style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just
one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains
parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new
state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.
Furthermore, we showcase SDPose as a zero-shot pose annotator for downstream
controllable generation tasks, including ControlNet-based image synthesis and
video generation, where it delivers qualitatively superior pose guidance.

Motivation: 现有方法在合成连续全景场景或提供自由探索能力方面存在局限性，PanoWorld-X旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过Unreal Engine模拟相机轨迹构建数据集，并引入Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer架构，在潜在空间中建模几何邻接关系。

Result: 实验表明，PanoWorld-X在运动范围、控制精度和视觉质量等方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PanoWorld-X在全景视频生成中具有显著优势，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Generating a complete and explorable 360-degree visual world enables a wide
range of downstream applications. While prior works have advanced the field,
they remain constrained by either narrow field-of-view limitations, which
hinder the synthesis of continuous and holistic scenes, or insufficient camera
controllability that restricts free exploration by users or autonomous agents.
To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity
and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories.
Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic
video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D
environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data
misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then
introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects
equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric
adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and
spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion
range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 提出Local View Transformer (LVT)，通过局部注意力机制解决标准Transformer的二次复杂度问题，实现大规模场景重建和新视角合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Transformer的二次复杂度难以扩展到大场景，而局部视图能提供更有效的场景信息。

Method: 利用局部邻域内的视图信息，结合相对几何变换的位置编码，输出3D高斯溅射场景表示。

Result: 实现了单次前向传播重建任意大规模、高分辨率场景。

Conclusion: LVT通过局部注意力机制高效解决了大场景重建问题。

Abstract: Large transformer models are proving to be a powerful tool for 3D vision and
novel view synthesis. However, the standard Transformer's well-known quadratic
complexity makes it difficult to scale these methods to large scenes. To
address this challenge, we propose the Local View Transformer (LVT), a
large-scale scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis architecture that
circumvents the need for the quadratic attention operation. Motivated by the
insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local
scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a
local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we
leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric
transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our
model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color
and opacity view-dependence. Taken together, the Local View Transformer enables
reconstruction of arbitrarily large, high-resolution scenes in a single forward
pass. See our project page for results and interactive demos

Result: 在COCO Stuff和ADE20K上达到竞争性的mIoU和像素准确率，与近期无监督基线相当。

Conclusion: CLASP是一种简单、无需训练的强大基线方法，适用于大规模未标注数据，易于复现。

Abstract: We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a
lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without
any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a
self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and
applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment
count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the
boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training
free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff
and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design
makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated
corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO算法在自回归图像生成中易导致训练不稳定、图像质量下降和泛化能力差，需解决梯度冲突和熵动态问题。

Method: 提出STAGE框架，采用优势/KL重加权缓解梯度冲突，引入熵奖励稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明STAGE在视觉质量、稳定性和跨任务泛化上优于基线GRPO。

Conclusion: STAGE通过针对性解决方案有效提升了自回归图像生成的稳定性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has recently been explored to improve text-to-image
generation, yet applying existing GRPO algorithms to autoregressive (AR) image
models remains challenging. The instability of the training process easily
disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in
marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work,
we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues:
contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy
dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable
framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting.
Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy
reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize
learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy
reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained
distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization
and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks
show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task
generalization compared to baseline GRPO.

TL;DR: VT-FSL框架通过结合LLMs和视觉信息，提出了一种新的少样本学习方法，解决了语义幻觉问题，并在多个基准测试中取得了最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决少样本学习中因缺乏实际实例导致的语义幻觉问题，提供更精确的跨模态提示。

Method: 提出Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP)和Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA)，通过LLMs生成精确的类别描述并合成图像，再通过几何对齐整合多模态信息。

Result: 在10个基准测试中实现了最优性能，包括标准、跨域和细粒度少样本学习场景。

Conclusion: VT-FSL通过跨模态提示和几何对齐，有效提升了少样本学习的性能，解决了语义噪声问题。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few
labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by
incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic
fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that
contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual
instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these
issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for
Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts
conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly
integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of
Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment
(CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support
images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single
structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic
understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of
semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act
respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level
class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited
support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support,
and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the
3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear
relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent
multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard,
cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios. Code is available
at https://github.com/peacelwh/VT-FSL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像注册在生物医学和生命科学中至关重要，但现有算法未能跟上图像采集能力的发展。

Method: FFDP结合了IO感知的非GEMM融合内核和分布式框架，优化了模型并行技术。

Result: 在8个A6000 GPU上，FFDP实现了570倍于标准临床数据的规模，加速了现有最优方法6-7倍，并减少峰值内存消耗20-59%。

Conclusion: FFDP在性能和效率上显著优于现有图像注册方法，适用于更大规模的问题。

Abstract: In this work, we propose FFDP, a set of IO-aware non-GEMM fused kernels
supplemented with a distributed framework for image registration at
unprecedented scales. Image registration is an inverse problem fundamental to
biomedical and life sciences, but algorithms have not scaled in tandem with
image acquisition capabilities. Our framework complements existing model
parallelism techniques proposed for large-scale transformer training by
optimizing non-GEMM bottlenecks and enabling convolution-aware tensor sharding.
We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration
of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an
inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a
minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art
optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while
reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250
micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing
SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains
of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.

TL;DR: GEM是一种基于3D高斯泼溅的新型冷冻电镜重建框架，在保持高效率的同时直接在实空间操作，显著提升了训练速度和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷冻电镜数据集规模庞大，传统傅里叶空间方法效率高但保真度低，而基于神经辐射场的实空间方法内存和计算开销大。

Method: GEM使用紧凑的3D高斯表示蛋白质，每个高斯仅由11个参数描述，并设计了新的梯度计算方法以减少内存和训练成本。

Result: 在标准基准测试中，GEM比现有方法训练速度快48%，内存使用降低12%，局部分辨率提升38.8%。

Conclusion: GEM为冷冻电镜重建提供了一种快速、高效且高分辨率的实用范例。

Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for
high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often
exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally
expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient
but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space
approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur
cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel
cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that
operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of
modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D
Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the
training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians
that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory
footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to
48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results
establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction,
unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy. Our code is available

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is a foundational task for computer vision.
Traditional methods are limited by data scarcity and quality, hindering their
robustness. To overcome this, we propose BRIDGE, an RL-optimized depth-to-image
(D2I) generation framework that synthesizes over 20M realistic and
geometrically accurate RGB images, each intrinsically paired with its ground
truth depth, from diverse source depth maps. Then we train our depth estimation
model on this dataset, employing a hybrid supervision strategy that integrates
teacher pseudo-labels with ground truth depth for comprehensive and robust
training. This innovative data generation and training paradigm enables BRIDGE
to achieve breakthroughs in scale and domain diversity, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches quantitatively and in
complex scene detail capture, thereby fostering general and robust depth
features. Code and models are available at

TL;DR: UniLat3D提出了一种统一框架，将几何和外观编码在单一潜在空间中，实现直接单阶段生成，解决了传统两阶段方法中的几何-纹理不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D生成方法采用两阶段流程（先几何后外观），导致几何-纹理不对齐且成本高。UniLat3D旨在通过统一表示解决这些问题。

Method: 提出几何-外观统一的VAE（UniLat），将高分辨率稀疏特征压缩为紧凑潜在表示，并训练流匹配模型直接从噪声生成UniLat。

Result: UniLat3D在公开数据集上训练，能在秒级时间内从单张图像生成高质量3D资产，几何和外观保真度均优于传统方法。

Conclusion: UniLat3D通过统一潜在空间和单阶段生成，显著提升了3D资产的生成效率和质量。

Abstract: High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While
recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic
content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline
that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled
design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost.
In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry
and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage
generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which
compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation
-- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense
low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D
formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation,
we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into
UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets,
UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image,
achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality. More demos \&
code are available at https://unilat3d.github.io/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MANI-Pure是一种基于扩散模型的对抗净化框架，通过自适应噪声注入提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗净化方法使用均匀噪声注入，破坏了语义结构且效果不佳。研究发现对抗扰动主要集中在高频区域，且强度模式各异。

Method: 提出MANI-Pure框架，利用输入的幅度谱指导净化过程，自适应地注入频率目标噪声。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和ImageNet-1K上验证，清洁准确率差距缩小至0.59，鲁棒准确率提升2.15，达到RobustBench榜首。

Conclusion: MANI-Pure通过频率自适应噪声注入，显著提升了对抗净化的效果，成为新的SOTA方法。

Abstract: Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising
defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise
injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic
structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that
adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly
concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity
patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this
observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification
framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the
purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure
adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively
suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude
bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of
MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original
classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1
robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous
state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）与基于网格的VR和图形应用不兼容的问题，简化流程并提升视觉质量。

Method: 在可微分泼溅框架中直接优化三角形，设计共享顶点参数化和不透明三角形训练策略。

Result: 在Mip-NeRF360和Tanks & Temples数据集上实现最先进的基于网格的新视图合成性能。

Conclusion: Triangle Splatting+ 在视觉保真度和效率上超越现有方法，支持下游应用如物理模拟和交互式漫游。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress
in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric
radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long
training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)
addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians,
enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian
primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR
headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to
convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines,
which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we
introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the
fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting
framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through
shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque
triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines
without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples
datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in
mesh-based novel view synthesis. Our method surpasses prior splatting
approaches in visual fidelity while remaining efficient and fast to training.
Moreover, the resulting semi-connected meshes support downstream applications
such as physics-based simulation or interactive walkthroughs. The project page

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于贝叶斯规则和条件期望的统一框架，将高斯扩散与流匹配结合，并扩展了Score identity Distillation（SiD）方法，验证其在多种文本到图像流匹配模型中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型采样速度慢的问题，探索流匹配与扩散模型的等效性，并验证蒸馏技术（如SiD）在流匹配模型中的直接应用。

Method: 通过贝叶斯规则和条件期望统一高斯扩散与流匹配，扩展SiD方法至多种预训练文本到图像流匹配模型（如SANA、SD3等）。

Result: 实验表明，SiD无需额外调整即可适用于多种流匹配模型，在数据无关和数据辅助设置下均有效，首次系统证明了分数蒸馏在流匹配模型中的广泛适用性。

Conclusion: 研究统一了扩散与流匹配生成器的加速技术，解决了稳定性和合理性问题，为文本到图像生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by
slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one-
or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct
framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion
under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation
techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple
derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies
Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations.
Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to
pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium,
SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show
that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works
out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings,
without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides
the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to
text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability
and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and
flow-based generators. We will make the PyTorch implementation publicly
available.

TL;DR: TemMed-Bench是首个专注于分析患者在不同临床访问中病情变化的基准测试，挑战大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在时间医学图像上的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学推理基准通常基于单次访问的图像分析，与真实临床实践不符，医生需要参考患者历史病情进行综合评估。

Method: 构建TemMed-Bench基准，包含视觉问答、报告生成和图像对选择三个任务，并评估12种LVLMs的性能。

Result: 大多数LVLMs在时间医学图像推理上表现不佳，部分模型接近随机猜测水平；多模态检索增强显著提升性能。

Conclusion: TemMed-Bench揭示了LVLMs在时间医学图像推理上的局限性，多模态检索增强是潜在改进方向。

Abstract: Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily
focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit.
However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice,
where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a
comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we
introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in
patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large
vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images.
TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual
question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a
supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we
conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results
show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes
over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a
random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini
and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they
have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the
input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain.
We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher
performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most
models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of
2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical
practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image
reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval
augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address
this challenge.

TL;DR: VideoAnchor模块通过子空间亲和性增强视觉线索，提升MLLMs在视觉空间推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在视觉-语言对齐方面表现优异，但在视觉空间推理中存在局限性，主要由于注意力机制中视觉标记被语言标记掩盖。

Method: 提出VideoAnchor模块，利用稀疏子空间聚类中的自表达性与Transformer注意力机制的联系，无需重新训练即可强化跨帧视觉线索。

Result: 在多个基准测试和骨干模型中表现一致提升，如VSI-Bench和Video-MME任务分别提升3.2%和4.6%。

Conclusion: VideoAnchor通过锚定共享视觉结构，显著提升了MLLMs的视觉空间推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive progress in
vision-language alignment, yet they remain limited in visual-spatial reasoning.
We first identify that this limitation arises from the attention mechanism:
visual tokens are overshadowed by language tokens, preventing the model from
consistently recognizing the same visual cues across frames. To address this
challenge, we draw a novel connection between the self-expressiveness property
in sparse subspace clustering and the attention mechanism in Transformers.
Building on this insight, we propose VideoAnchor, a plug-and-play module that
leverages subspace affinities to reinforce visual cues across frames without
retraining, effectively anchoring attention to shared visual structures.
Extensive experiments across benchmarks and backbone models show consistent
performance gains -- $e.g.$, 3.2% and 4.6% improvements on VSI-Bench and
Video-MME (spatial-related tasks) with InternVL2-8B and Qwen2.5VL-72B -- while
qualitative analyses demonstrate more coherent subspace partitions and stronger
visual grounding. Our codes will be made public available at

TL;DR: GSM8K-V是一个纯视觉多图像数学推理基准，填补了现有基准在几何、数学应用题和多图像推理上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉数学推理基准多局限于几何问题，缺乏数学应用题和多图像推理的评估，GSM8K-V旨在解决这些不足。

Method: 通过自动化图像生成流程和人工标注，将文本基准GSM8K转化为视觉形式，构建了1,319个高质量样本。

Result: 现有VLM在文本GSM8K上表现接近饱和，但在GSM8K-V上仍有显著提升空间（如Gemini-2.5-Pro准确率从95.22%降至46.93%）。

Conclusion: GSM8K-V为视觉数学推理提供了新视角，并为开发更鲁棒和通用的VLM设立了基准。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) achieve unified modeling of images and text,
enabling them to accomplish complex real-world tasks through perception,
planning, and reasoning. Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly
representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It
highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical
information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently,
numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they
are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and
rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we
introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning
benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the
widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed
automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation,
we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source
and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs
have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains
substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing
model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on
GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the
limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement.
GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and
establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and
generalizable VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成技术在长时视频流生成中容易累积错误，导致质量下降。

Method: 设计了联合去噪方案、注意力锚点机制和高效训练算法。

Result: 实验表明，Rolling Forcing能在单GPU上实时生成多分钟视频，错误累积显著减少。

Conclusion: Rolling Forcing有效解决了长视频流生成中的错误累积问题。

Abstract: Streaming video generation, as one fundamental component in interactive world
models and neural game engines, aims to generate high-quality, low-latency, and
temporally coherent long video streams. However, most existing work suffers
from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated
stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video
generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error
accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of
iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we
design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames
with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict
causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second,
we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video
generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial
frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global
consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables
few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm
operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on
self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing
enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU,
with substantially reduced error accumulation.

TL;DR: 提出一种对齐预训练视觉编码器作为潜在扩散模型标记器的方法，提升图像生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用基础编码器的丰富语义结构，避免从头训练VAE时过度关注低层细节。

Method: 三阶段对齐策略：冻结编码器训练适配器和解码器；联合优化所有组件；细化解码器提升重建质量。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上加速扩散模型收敛（gFID 1.90/64 epochs），并在2B参数文本到图像模型中超越FLUX VAE。

Conclusion: 方法简单、可扩展，为连续标记器设计建立了语义基础范式。

Abstract: In this work, we propose aligning pretrained visual encoders to serve as
tokenizers for latent diffusion models in image generation. Unlike training a
variational autoencoder (VAE) from scratch, which primarily emphasizes
low-level details, our approach leverages the rich semantic structure of
foundation encoders. We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze
the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent
space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic
preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while
retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved
reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image
tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\times$256, our
tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of
1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without
classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model
trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same
training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a
semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉模型在个性化任务中依赖昂贵微调或合成数据的问题，提供更灵活和通用的解决方案。

Result: PICO在性能上超越微调和合成数据基线，能灵活适应新任务并跨识别和生成任务泛化。

Conclusion: PICO为个性化视觉任务提供了一种高效、灵活且通用的方法。

Abstract: Modern vision models, trained on large-scale annotated datasets, excel at
predefined tasks but struggle with personalized vision -- tasks defined at test
time by users with customized objects or novel objectives. Existing
personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data
pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual
in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods
confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended
personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple
four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual
in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the
underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To
enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing
that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We
further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via
efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i)
surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to
novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and
generation.

Method: LayerCD通过对比浅层和深层视觉特征生成的输出分布，过滤幻觉。

Result: 在两项幻觉基准测试中，LayerCD显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LayerCD有效减少了MLLMs的幻觉问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown impressive perception and
reasoning capabilities, yet they often suffer from hallucinations -- generating
outputs that are linguistically coherent but inconsistent with the context of
the input image, including inaccuracies in objects, attributes, and relations.
To address this challenge, we propose a simple approach called Layer
Contrastive Decoding (LayerCD). Our design is motivated by the observation that
shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause
an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that
is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out
hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual
features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep
layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on
two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms
current state-of-the-art. The code for LayerCD is available at
https://github.com/maifoundations/LayerCD .

TL;DR: GHOST是一种自动生成图像的方法，用于测试多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的幻觉问题，成功率高且无需人工干预。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MLLMs中对象幻觉的静态基准测试局限性，主动生成诱导幻觉的图像以发现模型漏洞。

Method: 通过优化图像嵌入空间生成误导性图像，结合扩散模型生成自然图像，诱导模型幻觉。

Result: GHOST在多个模型中成功诱导幻觉，成功率超过28%，并发现可转移的漏洞。

Conclusion: GHOST不仅是诊断工具，还能通过微调减少幻觉，提升多模态系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a
persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the
image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with
fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering
model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce
GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method
designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce
hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or
prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to
mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a
diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking
images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original
input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to
hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including
reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success
rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery
methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and
object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST
uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce
hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on
our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and
corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.

TL;DR: DC-Gen通过深度压缩潜在空间加速文本到图像扩散模型，显著提升4K图像生成效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在高分辨率（如4K）生成时效率低下，且潜在空间存在冗余。

Method: 采用后训练流程和轻量级嵌入对齐训练，结合少量LoRA微调。

Result: DC-Gen-FLUX在NVIDIA H100 GPU上实现53倍加速，结合NVFP4 SVDQuant后总延迟降低138倍。

Conclusion: DC-Gen在不牺牲质量的前提下显著提升了高分辨率图像生成的效率。

Abstract: Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality
images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high
resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates
diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy
within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a
general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging
a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch
approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the
quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the
representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply
compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct
fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with
a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are
aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base
model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA
and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve
quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup.
Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on
the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a
4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total
latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model. Code:

Conclusion: DC-VideoGen显著提升了视频生成效率，适用于高分辨率视频生成。

Abstract: We introduce DC-VideoGen, a post-training acceleration framework for
efficient video generation. DC-VideoGen can be applied to any pre-trained video
diffusion model, improving efficiency by adapting it to a deep compression
latent space with lightweight fine-tuning. The framework builds on two key
innovations: (i) a Deep Compression Video Autoencoder with a novel chunk-causal
temporal design that achieves 32x/64x spatial and 4x temporal compression while
preserving reconstruction quality and generalization to longer videos; and (ii)
AE-Adapt-V, a robust adaptation strategy that enables rapid and stable transfer
of pre-trained models into the new latent space. Adapting the pre-trained
Wan-2.1-14B model with DC-VideoGen requires only 10 GPU days on the NVIDIA H100
GPU. The accelerated models achieve up to 14.8x lower inference latency than
their base counterparts without compromising quality, and further enable
2160x3840 video generation on a single GPU. Code:

Motivation: 现有方法难以处理长视频中的大变形和有限视角覆盖问题，PAD3R旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 通过训练个性化的姿态估计器，结合生成先验和可微分渲染，优化可变形3D高斯表示。

Result: PAD3R在多种挑战性场景中表现出色，能够重建高保真、可动的3D对象。

Conclusion: PAD3R在动态场景理解和3D内容生成方面具有潜力。

Abstract: We present PAD3R, a method for reconstructing deformable 3D objects from
casually captured, unposed monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R
handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation,
large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge
conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized,
object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model.
This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The
optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the
entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable
rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of
objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging
scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D
content creation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结构化图像处理中存在低保真和线性推理模式的局限性，PixelCraft旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过多智能体系统（包括调度器、规划器、推理器等）和动态三阶段工作流程（工具选择、代理讨论、自我批评）实现高保真处理和灵活推理。

Result: 在图表和几何基准测试中，PixelCraft显著提升了视觉推理性能，为结构化图像推理设定了新标准。

Conclusion: PixelCraft通过高保真处理和灵活推理模式，有效解决了结构化图像任务中的挑战。

Abstract: Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging
for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade
into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning;
however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image
processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness
on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a
novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual
reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a
reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity
processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a
grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with
traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this
foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic
three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism.
Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical
images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively
revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and
dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive
experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that
PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced
MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/microsoft/PixelCraft.

TL;DR: FlashI2V通过隐式条件嵌入和傅里叶引导，解决了I2V生成中的条件图像泄漏问题，提升了泛化能力和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有I2V方法因条件图像泄漏导致性能下降，如运动缓慢和颜色不一致，且对域外数据泛化能力差。

Method: 提出FlashI2V，包含隐式条件嵌入的潜在偏移和傅里叶引导，以优化生成过程。

Result: 在Vbench-I2V上动态度得分为53.01，优于更大模型，且参数仅1.3B。

Conclusion: FlashI2V有效解决了条件图像泄漏问题，提升了域外数据的泛化能力。

Abstract: In Image-to-Video (I2V) generation, a video is created using an input image
as the first-frame condition. Existing I2V methods concatenate the full
information of the conditional image with noisy latents to achieve high
fidelity. However, the denoisers in these methods tend to shortcut the
conditional image, which is known as conditional image leakage, leading to
performance degradation issues such as slow motion and color inconsistency. In
this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to
overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain
scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named
FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists
of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow
matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy
latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance.
We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to
accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the
generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively
overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and
performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B
parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V,
surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P. Github page:

TL;DR: Visual Jigsaw是一种自监督的后训练框架，通过视觉拼图任务增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视觉理解能力，无需额外生成组件或标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练范式以文本为中心，视觉输入仅用于提取稀疏线索。本文旨在通过视觉中心的自监督任务提升MLLMs的视觉理解能力。

Method: 提出Visual Jigsaw框架，将视觉输入分割、打乱，模型需通过自然语言生成正确排列顺序，利用可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）。

Result: 在图像、视频和3D数据上实验表明，模型在细粒度感知、时序推理和3D空间理解方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 自监督视觉中心任务在后训练MLLMs中具有潜力，可激发更多视觉中心设计的研究。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal
large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial
for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current
post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual
inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning.
There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely
on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative
designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised
post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs.
Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are
partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by
producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns
with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no
additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal
automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across
three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception,
temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the
potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and
aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs. Project

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何将3D基础模型（3DFMs）应用于密集新视角合成（NVS），提出了VGGT-X方法以解决内存和输出质量的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前NVS方法依赖SfM获取的3D属性，速度慢且不稳定；3DFMs在稀疏视图下表现良好，但在密集视图下存在内存和输出质量的问题。

Method: 提出VGGT-X，包括内存高效的VGGT实现、自适应全局对齐和鲁棒的3DGS训练方法。

Result: 实验表明，VGGT-X显著缩小了与COLMAP初始化管线的差距，在密集NVS和姿态估计中达到SOTA。

Conclusion: VGGT-X为3D基础模型和密集NVS的未来发展提供了见解，但仍存在与COLMAP初始化渲染的差距。

Abstract: We study the problem of applying 3D Foundation Models (3DFMs) to dense Novel
View Synthesis (NVS). Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis
powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D
attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from
Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or
low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over
the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the
validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study
reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental
barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that
degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we
introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that
scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output
enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show
that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with
COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense
COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation. Additionally, we analyze the causes of
remaining gaps with COLMAP-initialized rendering, providing insights for the
future development of 3D foundation models and dense NVS. Our project page is

Abstract: Accurate localization is crucial for effectively operating mobile robots in
indoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive approach to mobile
robot localization by integrating an ultrasound-based indoor positioning system
(IPS) with wheel odometry data via sensor fusion techniques. The fusion
methodology leverages the strengths of both IPS and wheel odometry,
compensating for the individual limitations of each method. The Extended Kalman
Filter (EKF) fusion method combines the data from the IPS sensors and the
robot's wheel odometry, providing a robust and reliable localization solution.
Extensive experiments in a controlled indoor environment reveal that the
fusion-based localization system significantly enhances accuracy and precision
compared to standalone systems. The results demonstrate significant
improvements in trajectory tracking, with the EKF-based approach reducing
errors associated with wheel slippage and sensor noise.

Abstract: This paper introduces a proposed control method for autonomous personal
mobility vehicles, specifically the Single-passenger Electric Autonomous
Transporter (SEATER), using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). The
proposed method leverages a single-shooting approach to solve the optimal
control problem (OCP) via non-linear programming (NLP). The proposed NMPC is
implemented to a non-holonomic vehicle with a differential drive system, using
odometry data as localization feedback to guide the vehicle towards its target
pose while achieving objectives and adhering to constraints, such as obstacle
avoidance. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, a number of
simulations have been conducted in both obstacle-free and static obstacle
environments. The SEATER model and testing environment have been developed in
the Gazebo Simulation and the NMPC are implemented within the Robot Operating
System (ROS) framework. The simulation results demonstrate that the NMPC-based
approach successfully controls the vehicle to reach the desired target location
while satisfying the imposed constraints. Furthermore, this study highlights
the robustness and real-time effectiveness of NMPC with a single-shooting
approach for autonomous vehicle control in the evaluated scenarios.

Conclusion: ReSeFlow结合了SE(3)-等变性和整流流优势，为生成策略学习模型的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in unstructured environments requires the generation of
robust and long-horizon trajectory-level policy with conditions of perceptual
observations and benefits from the advantages of SE(3)-equivariant diffusion
models that are data-efficient. However, these models suffer from the inference
time costs. Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we
introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the
ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing
fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially,
both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and
translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body
motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the
proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance
with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5%
error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating
triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes
advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward
for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the
data and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Intelligent agents often require collaborative strategies to achieve complex
tasks beyond individual capabilities in real-world scenarios. While existing
audio-visual navigation (AVN) research mainly focuses on single-agent systems,
their limitations emerge in dynamic 3D environments where rapid multi-agent
coordination is critical, especially for time-sensitive applications like
emergency response. This paper introduces MASTAVN (Multi-Agent Scalable
Transformer Audio-Visual Navigation), a scalable framework enabling two agents
to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D
environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint
audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal
synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators
(Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task
completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared
to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential
role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems. Our findings
validate MASTAVN's effectiveness in time-sensitive emergency scenarios and
establish a paradigm for advancing scalable multi-agent embodied intelligence
in complex 3D environments.

Motivation: 解决3D IC设计中因复杂性增加而导致的死区问题和布局质量挑战，探索数据驱动方法替代传统电子设计自动化（EDA）的可能性。

Method: 使用开源LLMs在合成数据集上进行微调，并通过后序切片树表示法生成合法的空间规划方案。

Result: 在测试案例中实现了零死区布局，并在MCNC案例（如ami33和ami49）中表现出一定的泛化能力，但较大或不规则实例仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: LLM-based空间规划可作为传统EDA方法的补充，为可扩展的3D布局生成提供新思路，并具有跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional integrated circuits (3D ICs) have emerged as a promising
solution to the scaling limits of two-dimensional designs, offering higher
integration density, shorter interconnects, and improved performance. As design
complexity increases, effective space planning becomes essential to reduce dead
space and ensure layout quality. This study investigates the use of large
language models (LLMs) for 3D IC space planning through a post-order slicing
tree representation, which guarantees legal space plans while aiming to
minimize dead space. Open-source LLMs were fine-tuned on large-scale synthetic
datasets and further evaluated on MCNC-derived 3D benchmarks. Experimental
results indicate that the proposed framework achieves a favorable balance
between runtime efficiency, legality, and dead-space reduction, with
zero-dead-space layouts obtained in a significant portion of test cases under
practical runtime budgets. Beyond synthetic benchmarks, the method generalizes
to MCNC cases such as ami33 and ami49, though larger and irregular instances
remain challenging. The approach also shows potential for cross-domain
applications, including logistics and 3D object placement, where spatial
efficiency is critical. Overall, the results suggest that LLM-based space
planning can serve as a data-driven complement to traditional electronic design
automation (EDA) methods, providing new insights for scalable 3D layout
generation.

TL;DR: PAMR框架通过自回归方法联合构建车道向量和交通规则，解决了现有方法在长时间驾驶序列中规则持久性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注几何元素或将规则视为临时分类，无法捕捉规则在长时间驾驶序列中的持久有效性。

Method: 提出PAMR框架，包含Map-Rule Co-Construction和Map-Rule Cache机制，用于处理驾驶场景并保持规则一致性。

Result: PAMR在联合向量-规则映射任务中表现优异，并在长时间驾驶序列中保持规则有效性。

Conclusion: PAMR通过创新的机制和评估方法，显著提升了自动驾驶中地图和规则的持久一致性。

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving requires both accurate HD map construction and
persistent awareness of traffic rules, even when their associated signs are no
longer visible. However, existing methods either focus solely on geometric
elements or treat rules as temporary classifications, failing to capture their
persistent effectiveness across extended driving sequences. In this paper, we
present PAMR (Persistent Autoregressive Mapping with Traffic Rules), a novel
framework that performs autoregressive co-construction of lane vectors and
traffic rules from visual observations. Our approach introduces two key
mechanisms: Map-Rule Co-Construction for processing driving scenes in temporal
segments, and Map-Rule Cache for maintaining rule consistency across these
segments. To properly evaluate continuous and consistent map generation, we
develop MapDRv2, featuring improved lane geometry annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PAMR achieves superior performance in joint
vector-rule mapping tasks, while maintaining persistent rule effectiveness
throughout extended driving sequences.

practices, and (3) develop new modular pipelines that advance prior work while
abiding by the proposed standards and guidelines.

Conclusion: 该框架在四足机器人共享自主权中表现出色，能够适应动态环境和人类行为不确定性。

Abstract: Ensuring safe and effective collaboration between humans and autonomous
legged robots is a fundamental challenge in shared autonomy, particularly for
teleoperated systems navigating cluttered environments. Conventional
shared-control approaches often rely on fixed blending strategies that fail to
capture the dynamics of legged locomotion and may compromise safety. This paper
presents a teleoperator-aware, safety-critical, adaptive nonlinear model
predictive control (ANMPC) framework for shared autonomy of quadrupedal robots
in obstacle-avoidance tasks. The framework employs a fixed arbitration weight
between human and robot actions but enhances this scheme by modeling the human
input with a noisily rational Boltzmann model, whose parameters are adapted
online using a projected gradient descent (PGD) law from observed joystick
commands. Safety is enforced through control barrier function (CBF) constraints
integrated into a computationally efficient NMPC, ensuring forward invariance
of safe sets despite uncertainty in human behavior. The control architecture is
hierarchical: a high-level CBF-based ANMPC (10 Hz) generates blended
human-robot velocity references, a mid-level dynamics-aware NMPC (60 Hz)
enforces reduced-order single rigid body (SRB) dynamics to track these
references, and a low-level nonlinear whole-body controller (500 Hz) imposes
the full-order dynamics via quadratic programming to track the mid-level
trajectories. Extensive numerical and hardware experiments, together with a
user study, on a Unitree Go2 quadrupedal robot validate the framework,
demonstrating real-time obstacle avoidance, online learning of human intent
parameters, and safe teleoperator collaboration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的个性化肌肉骨骼模型参数识别对协作机器人系统（如辅助外骨骼）的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但现有方法因难以测量深层肌肉EMG而受限。

Method: 通过仅使用深层肌肉力的最小二乘解计算损失梯度，在可微分优化框架中识别模型参数。

Result: 广泛的对比模拟表明，该方法在估计精度上与类似方法相当，且无需所有肌肉EMG数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为个性化肌肉骨骼建模提供了一种可靠且鲁棒的解决方案，克服了深层肌肉EMG测量的限制。

Abstract: Accurate parameter identification of a subject-specific human musculoskeletal
model is crucial to the development of safe and reliable physically
collaborative robotic systems, for instance, assistive exoskeletons.
Electromyography (EMG)-based parameter identification methods have demonstrated
promising performance for personalized musculoskeletal modeling, whereas their
applicability is limited by the difficulty of measuring deep muscle EMGs
invasively. Although several strategies have been proposed to reconstruct deep
muscle EMGs or activations for parameter identification, their reliability and
robustness are limited by assumptions about the deep muscle behavior. In this
work, we proposed an approach to simultaneously identify the bone and
superficial muscle parameters of a human arm musculoskeletal model without
reconstructing the deep muscle EMGs. This is achieved by only using the
least-squares solution of the deep muscle forces to calculate a loss gradient
with respect to the model parameters for identifying them in a framework of
differentiable optimization. The results of extensive comparative simulations
manifested that our proposed method can achieve comparable estimation accuracy
compared to a similar method, but with all the muscle EMGs available.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为动态缓冲区的新规划原语，用于解决杂乱桌面环境中物体重排的低效问题，通过临时可移动堆叠提高效率和可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划器在密集场景中效率低下，使用固定缓冲区（如静态堆叠）限制了灵活性，动态缓冲区通过模仿人类分组策略解决了这一问题。

Method: 引入动态缓冲区，允许形成临时可移动的堆叠单元，从而优化物体重排的路径和成本。

Result: 在密集场景中减少机械臂移动成本11.89%，在低密度场景中减少5.69%，并通过实验验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 动态缓冲区是高效且鲁棒的物体重排规划的关键原语。

Abstract: Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a
long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate
inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed
buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to
resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense
scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from
reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra
buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports
another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these
issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced.
Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary,
movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both
feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in
large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art
rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89%
in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density
settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through
experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings
establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust
rearrangement planning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Empart是一个交互式工具，允许用户为3D网格的不同区域指定不同的简化容差，显著提升机器人应用中的仿真性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在整个网格上应用统一的误差容差，导致在关键区域和非关键区域之间无法平衡精度和性能。

Method: 利用现有凸分解算法，结合并行化框架处理区域特定约束，提供可视化反馈界面。

Result: 在固定误差阈值下，Empart比V-HACD方法减少了凸部分数量，仿真时间缩短69%。

Conclusion: 交互式、区域特定的简化方法对高效机器人应用具有重要价值。

Abstract: Simplifying complex 3D meshes is a crucial step in robotics applications to
enable efficient motion planning and physics simulation. Common methods, such
as approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple
parts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing
approaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can
result in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For
instance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the
vicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification
elsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical
areas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.
  To address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that
allows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected
regions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition
algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle
region-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly
interface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation
performance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We
demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts
compared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold,
leading to substantial speedups in simulation performance. For a robotic
pick-and-place task, Empart-generated collision meshes reduced the overall
simulation time by 69% compared to a uniform decomposition, highlighting the
value of interactive, region-specific simplification for performant robotics
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯过程方法通常假设全局长度尺度或忽略时间变化，导致不确定性估计不准确。

Result: 在多样环境中评估了方法，提供了空间长度尺度估计的收敛分析和动态遗憾界限。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了非均匀时空环境中场估计的问题，优化了不确定性估计和机器人分配。

Abstract: Autonomous robots are increasingly deployed to estimate spatiotemporal fields
(e.g., wind, temperature, gas concentration) that vary across space and time.
We consider environments divided into non-overlapping regions with distinct
spatial and temporal dynamics, termed non-uniform spatiotemporal environments.
Gaussian Processes (GPs) can be used to estimate these fields. The GP model
depends on a kernel that encodes how the field co-varies in space and time,
with its spatial and temporal lengthscales defining the correlation. Hence,
when these lengthscales are incorrect or do not correspond to the actual field,
the estimates of uncertainty can be highly inaccurate. Existing GP methods
often assume one global lengthscale or update only periodically; some allow
spatial variation but ignore temporal changes. To address these limitations, we
propose a two-phase framework for multi-robot field estimation. Phase 1 uses a
variogram-driven planner to learn region-specific spatial lengthscales. Phase 2
employs an allocation strategy that reassigns robots based on the current
uncertainty, and updates sampling as temporal lengthscales are refined. For
encoding uncertainty, we utilize clarity, an information metric from our
earlier work. We evaluate the proposed method across diverse environments and
provide convergence analysis for spatial lengthscale estimation, along with
dynamic regret bounds quantifying the gap to the oracle's allocation sequence.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GW算法通过自适应整合视觉SLAM和航位推算，提升在纹理缺失或视觉退化环境中的定位精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉SLAM在纹理缺失或视觉退化环境中表现不佳，而航位推算短期可靠但长期不稳定。

Method: 提出GW算法，自适应调整航位推算与视觉SLAM的权重，优化各模块以整合两者。

Result: 实验证明GW算法提升了视觉SLAM的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: GW算法为移动导航提供了实用解决方案，增强了视觉SLAM的适应性。

Abstract: Given that Visual SLAM relies on appearance cues for localization and scene
understanding, texture-less or visually degraded environments (e.g., plain
walls or low lighting) lead to poor pose estimation and track loss. However,
robots are typically equipped with sensors that provide some form of dead
reckoning odometry with reasonable short-time performance but unreliable
long-time performance. The Good Weights (GW) algorithm described here provides
a framework to adaptively integrate dead reckoning (DR) with passive visual
SLAM for continuous and accurate frame-level pose estimation. Importantly, it
describes how all modules in a comprehensive SLAM system must be modified to
incorporate DR into its design. Adaptive weighting increases DR influence when
visual tracking is unreliable and reduces when visual feature information is
strong, maintaining pose track without overreliance on DR. Good Weights yields
a practical solution for mobile navigation that improves visual SLAM
performance and robustness. Experiments on collected datasets and in real-world
deployment demonstrate the benefits of Good Weights.

Conclusion: ARMimic为多样化现实场景中的机器人学习提供了安全、无缝且可扩展的数据收集方案。

Abstract: Imitation learning is a powerful paradigm for robot skill acquisition, yet
conventional demonstration methods--such as kinesthetic teaching and
teleoperation--are cumbersome, hardware-heavy, and disruptive to workflows.
Recently, passive observation using extended reality (XR) headsets has shown
promise for egocentric demonstration collection, yet current approaches require
additional hardware, complex calibration, or constrained recording conditions
that limit scalability and usability. We present ARMimic, a novel framework
that overcomes these limitations with a lightweight and hardware-minimal setup
for scalable, robot-free data collection using only a consumer XR headset and a
stationary workplace camera. ARMimic integrates egocentric hand tracking,
augmented reality (AR) robot overlays, and real-time depth sensing to ensure
collision-aware, kinematically feasible demonstrations. A unified imitation
learning pipeline is at the core of our method, treating both human and virtual
robot trajectories as interchangeable, which enables policies that generalize
across different embodiments and environments. We validate ARMimic on two
manipulation tasks, including challenging long-horizon bowl stacking. In our
experiments, ARMimic reduces demonstration time by 50% compared to
teleoperation and improves task success by 11% over ACT, a state-of-the-art
baseline trained on teleoperated data. Our results demonstrate that ARMimic
enables safe, seamless, and in-the-wild data collection, offering great
potential for scalable robot learning in diverse real-world settings.

Abstract: A significant challenge in autonomous racing is to generate overtaking
maneuvers. Racing agents must execute these maneuvers on complex racetracks
with little room for error. Optimization techniques and graph-based methods
have been proposed, but these methods often rely on oversimplified assumptions
for collision-avoidance and dynamic constraints. In this work, we present an
approach to trajectory synthesis based on an extension of the Differential
Bayesian Filtering framework. Our approach for collision-free trajectory
synthesis frames the problem as one of Bayesian Inference over the space of
Composite Bezier Curves. Our method is derivative-free, does not require a
spherical approximation of the vehicle footprint, linearization of constraints,
or simplifying upper bounds on collision avoidance. We conduct a closed-loop
analysis of DBF-MA and find it successfully overtakes an opponent in 87% of
tested scenarios, outperforming existing methods in autonomous overtaking.

Conclusion: 提出的自适应控制器在延迟条件下实现了安全的人机轨迹同步，适用于实际协作任务。

Abstract: In this paper, an adaptive controller is designed for the synchronization of
the trajectory of a robot with unknown kinematics and dynamics to that of the
current human trajectory in the task space using the delayed human trajectory
information. The communication time delay may be a result of various factors
that arise in human-robot collaboration tasks, such as sensor processing or
fusion to estimate trajectory/intent, network delays, or computational
limitations. The developed adaptive controller uses Barrier Lyapunov Function
(BLF) to constrain the Cartesian coordinates of the robot to ensure safety, an
ICL-based adaptive law to account for the unknown kinematics, and a
gradient-based adaptive law to estimate unknown dynamics. Barrier
Lyapunov-Krasovskii (LK) functionals are used for the stability analysis to
show that the synchronization and parameter estimation errors remain
semi-globally uniformly ultimately bounded (SGUUB). The simulation results
based on a human-robot synchronization scenario with time delay are provided to
demonstrate the effectiveness of the designed synchronization controller with
safety constraints.

bridge this gap between human and robot manipulation capabilities, we propose
UniPrototype, a novel framework that enables effective knowledge transfer from
human to robot domains via shared motion primitives. ur approach makes three
key contributions: (1) We introduce a compositional prototype discovery
mechanism with soft assignments, enabling multiple primitives to co-activate
and thus capture blended and hierarchical skills; (2) We propose an adaptive
prototype selection strategy that automatically adjusts the number of
prototypes to match task complexity, ensuring scalable and efficient
representation; (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through
extensive experiments in both simulation environments and real-world robotic
systems. Our results show that UniPrototype successfully transfers human
manipulation knowledge to robots, significantly improving learning efficiency
and task performance compared to existing approaches.The code and dataset will
be released upon acceptance at an anonymous repository.

Abstract: End-of-Life (EoL) phones significantly exacerbate global e-waste challenges
due to their high production volumes and short lifecycles. Disassembly is among
the most critical processes in EoL phone recycling. However, it relies heavily
on human labor due to product variability. Consequently, the manual process is
both labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose a low-cost,
easily deployable automated and selective disassembly and sorting system for
EoL phones, consisting of three subsystems: an adaptive cutting system, a
vision-based robotic sorting system, and a battery removal system. The system
can process over 120 phones per hour with an average disassembly success rate
of 98.9%, efficiently delivering selected high-value components to downstream
processing. It provides a reliable and scalable automated solution to the
pressing challenge of EoL phone disassembly. Additionally, the automated system
can enhance disassembly economics, converting a previously unprofitable process
into one that yields a net profit per unit weight of EoL phones.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and sim-to-real transfer have advanced robotic
manipulation of rigid objects. Yet, policies remain brittle when applied to
articulated mechanisms due to contact-rich dynamics and under-modeled joint
phenomena such as friction, stiction, backlash, and clearances. We address this
challenge through dexterous in-hand manipulation of articulated tools using a
robotic hand with reduced articulation and kinematic redundancy relative to the
human hand. Our controller augments a simulation-trained base policy with a
sensor-driven refinement learned from hardware demonstrations, conditioning on
proprioception and target articulation states while fusing whole-hand tactile
and force feedback with the policy's internal action intent via
cross-attention-based integration. This design enables online adaptation to
instance-specific articulation properties, stabilizes contact interactions,
regulates internal forces, and coordinates coupled-link motion under
perturbations. We validate our approach across a diversity of real-world
examples, including scissors, pliers, minimally invasive surgical tools, and
staplers. We achieve robust transfer from simulation to hardware, improved
disturbance resilience, and generalization to previously unseen articulated
tools, thereby reducing reliance on precise physical modeling in contact-rich
settings.

Conclusion: ST-OVSG能够泛化到新类别，并在不微调的情况下提升规划鲁棒性，有效解决了传输延迟带来的问题。

Abstract: Teleoperation via natural-language reduces operator workload and enhances
safety in high-risk or remote settings. However, in dynamic remote scenes,
transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between
remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command
misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the
Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that
enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight
latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D
object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian
assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal
scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to
retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state
mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and
highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering
strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to
novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency
without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74
percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph.
Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by
ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.

TL;DR: 提出一个工业级多模态干扰数据集，用于复杂条件下的机器人感知与控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境干扰导致高度非线性和强耦合的机器人行为，现有数据集难以有效表征。

Result: 实验表明数据集增强了模型验证鲁棒性，提高了机器人在动态干扰环境中的操作稳定性。

Conclusion: 数据集公开可用，适用于工业4.0应用中的机器人研究。

Abstract: In Industry 4.0 applications, dynamic environmental interference induces
highly nonlinear and strongly coupled interactions between the environmental
state and robotic behavior. Effectively representing dynamic environmental
states through multimodal sensor data fusion remains a critical challenge in
current robotic datasets. To address this, an industrial-grade multimodal
interference dataset is presented, designed for robotic perception and control
under complex conditions. The dataset integrates multi-dimensional interference
features including size, color, and lighting variations, and employs
high-precision sensors to synchronously collect visual, torque, and joint-state
measurements. Scenarios with geometric similarity exceeding 85\% and
standardized lighting gradients are included to ensure real-world
representativeness. Microsecond-level time-synchronization and
vibration-resistant data acquisition protocols, implemented via the Robot
Operating System (ROS), guarantee temporal and operational fidelity.
Experimental results demonstrate that the dataset enhances model validation
robustness and improves robotic operational stability in dynamic,
interference-rich environments. The dataset is publicly available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零售环境中机器人操作饮料瓶时，仅依赖视觉信息难以处理细微接触事件，导致需要昂贵的人工远程操作。

Method: 采用多模态模仿学习策略，结合Action Chunking Transformer（ACT）和力/扭矩传感，实现端到端学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在抓取和重新定向任务中比基线表现更好，力/扭矩信号在视觉受限的按压和放置阶段尤为有用。

Conclusion: 结合现代模仿学习架构和轻量级力/扭矩传感，为零售环境中机器人操作的规模化提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Manipulator robots are increasingly being deployed in retail environments,
yet contact rich edge cases still trigger costly human teleoperation. A
prominent example is upright lying beverage bottles, where purely visual cues
are often insufficient to resolve subtle contact events required for precise
manipulation. We present a multimodal Imitation Learning policy that augments
the Action Chunking Transformer with force and torque sensing, enabling
end-to-end learning over images, joint states, and forces and torques. Deployed
on Ghost, single-arm platform by Telexistence Inc, our approach improves
Pick-and-Reorient bottle task by detecting and exploiting contact transitions
during pressing and placement. Hardware experiments demonstrate greater task
success compared to baseline matching the observation space of ACT as an
ablation and experiments indicate that force and torque signals are beneficial
in the press and place phases where visual observability is limited, supporting
the use of interaction forces as a complementary modality for contact rich
skills. The results suggest a practical path to scaling retail manipulation by
combining modern imitation learning architectures with lightweight force and
torque sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Wi-Fi RSSI指纹定位精度不足，而LiDAR方案成本高且复杂，需一种兼顾精度与实用性的解决方案。

Method: 通过DNN-based Wi-Fi RSSI粗定位，结合IMU动态定位和Gmapping SLAM生成地图，利用EKF融合传感器数据并抑制噪声。

Result: 实验显示，多传感器融合框架的平均2D误差为0.2449-0.3781米，显著优于单独Wi-Fi或LiDAR/IMU方案。

Conclusion: 多传感器融合有效抑制了单一方法的缺陷，提供了稳定且高精度的室内定位性能。

Abstract: Conventional Wi-Fi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) fingerprinting
cannot meet the growing demand for accurate indoor localization and navigation
due to its lower accuracy, while solutions based on light detection and ranging
(LiDAR) can provide better localization performance but is limited by their
higher deployment cost and complexity. To address these issues, we propose a
novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI
fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and
inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter
(EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based
Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a
Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency
attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating
sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU
drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building
at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed
multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual
approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations
with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In
contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m
in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization
are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.

Motivation: 探索自然语言是否能作为反馈信号，帮助机器人从错误中学习并改进。

Method: 提出LAGEA框架，结合视觉语言模型生成反馈，并将其转化为强化学习的奖励信号。

Result: 在Meta-World MT10基准测试中，LAGEA比现有方法平均成功率提高9.0%（随机目标）和5.3%（固定目标），且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 结构化且时间基础的自然语言反馈能有效帮助机器人自我反思并改进决策。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation benefits from foundation models that describe goals, but
today's agents still lack a principled way to learn from their own mistakes. We
ask whether natural language can serve as feedback, an error reasoning signal
that helps embodied agents diagnose what went wrong and correct course. We
introduce LAGEA (Language Guided Embodied Agents), a framework that turns
episodic, schema-constrained reflections from a vision language model (VLM)
into temporally grounded guidance for reinforcement learning. LAGEA summarizes
each attempt in concise language, localizes the decisive moments in the
trajectory, aligns feedback with visual state in a shared representation, and
converts goal progress and feedback agreement into bounded, step-wise shaping
rewardswhose influence is modulated by an adaptive, failure-aware coefficient.
This design yields dense signals early when exploration needs direction and
gracefully recedes as competence grows. On the Meta-World MT10 embodied
manipulation benchmark, LAGEA improves average success over the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods by 9.0% on random goals and 5.3% on fixed
goals, while converging faster. These results support our hypothesis: language,
when structured and grounded in time, is an effective mechanism for teaching
robots to self-reflect on mistakes and make better choices. Code will be
released soon.

Conclusion: 该框架能够识别缺失的运动技能并在安全关键环境中有效响应。

Abstract: We present an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over
dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing methods often depend on
heuristics for real-time foothold selection-limiting robustness and
adaptability-or rely on computationally intensive trajectory optimization
across complex terrains and long horizons. In contrast, our approach combines
reactive synthesis for generating correct-by-construction symbolic-level
controllers with mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and
physically feasible footstep planning during each symbolic transition. To
reduce the reliance on costly MICP solves and accommodate specifications that
may be violated due to physical infeasibility, we adopt a symbolic repair
mechanism that selectively generates only the required symbolic transitions.
During execution, real-time MICP replanning based on actual terrain data,
combined with runtime symbolic repair and delay-aware coordination, enables
seamless bridging between offline synthesis and online operation. Through
extensive simulation and hardware experiments, we validate the framework's
ability to identify missing locomotion skills and respond effectively in
safety-critical environments, including scattered stepping stones and rebar
scenarios.

Result: 在四足、双足和四旋翼机器人上实现SOTA性能，并成功应用于实际场景。

Conclusion: CE-Nav是高效、可扩展的通用导航解决方案。

Abstract: Generalizing local navigation policies across diverse robot morphologies is a
critical challenge. Progress is often hindered by the need for costly and
embodiment-specific data, the tight coupling of planning and control, and the
"disastrous averaging" problem where deterministic models fail to capture
multi-modal decisions (e.g., turning left or right). We introduce CE-Nav, a
novel two-stage (IL-then-RL) framework that systematically decouples universal
geometric reasoning from embodiment-specific dynamic adaptation. First, we
train an embodiment-agnostic General Expert offline using imitation learning.
This expert, a conditional normalizing flow model named VelFlow, learns the
full distribution of kinematically-sound actions from a large-scale dataset
generated by a classical planner, completely avoiding real robot data and
resolving the multi-modality issue. Second, for a new robot, we freeze the
expert and use it as a guiding prior to train a lightweight, Dynamics-Aware
Refiner via online reinforcement learning. This refiner rapidly learns to
compensate for the target robot's specific dynamics and controller
imperfections with minimal environmental interaction. Extensive experiments on
quadrupeds, bipeds, and quadrotors show that CE-Nav achieves state-of-the-art
performance while drastically reducing adaptation cost. Successful real-world
deployments further validate our approach as an efficient and scalable solution
for building generalizable navigation systems.

Motivation: 在多机器人团队中，保持各区域相对不确定性一致是实现均匀信息采集质量的关键，但噪声水平未知且初始估计不可靠。

Method: 通过模拟退火生成目标采样分布，从均匀分布逐渐过渡到估计的最优分布，利用采样熵作为能量调整Boltzmann分布的冷度参数。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了噪声水平未知导致的初始估计不可靠问题，显著提升了信息采集质量。

Abstract: One of the goals of active information acquisition using multi-robot teams is
to keep the relative uncertainty in each region at the same level to maintain
identical acquisition quality (e.g., consistent target detection) in all the
regions. To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the
number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise
levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this
noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and
can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use
simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from
uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying
the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling
entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both
transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic
searches. Finally, a demonstration is performed with a TurtleBot swarm system
to validate the physical applicability of the algorithm.

TL;DR: GLUE框架通过全局-局部统一编码和关键补丁跟踪，解决了复杂OOD场景下视觉表示学习中的注意力稀释问题，提升了模仿学习的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂OOD场景中，全局视觉表示的注意力可能被干扰，导致策略性能下降。局部表示的不变性为解决此问题提供了可能。

Method: GLUE通过文本引导机制选择和跟踪关键补丁，并设计了一种新颖的融合框架，将全局和局部特征结合，生成低异质性的细粒度特征。

Result: GLUE在仿真和真实环境中表现优异，分别比基线方法提升了17.6%、36.3%和58.3%。

Conclusion: GLUE通过全局-局部特征融合，有效提升了模仿学习在复杂场景中的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: In recent years, visual representation learning has gained widespread
attention in robotic imitation learning. However, in complex
Out-of-Distribution(OOD) settings characterized by clutter and occlusion, the
attention of global visual representations can be diluted or interfered,
leading to degraded policy performance. The invariance of local representations
for task-relevant objects offers a solution. By efficiently utilizing these
local representations, training and testing data can be mapped to a more
similar feature space, thereby mitigating the covariate shift problem.
Accordingly, we propose GLUE, a global-local unified encoding framework for
imitation learning based on key-patch tracking. GLUE selects and tracks
key-patches as critical local representations by employing a text-guided
mechanism. It features a novel fusion framework where global patch features
query local patches to distill essential information, yielding fine-grained
local features with low heterogeneity relative to the global context. This
fused representation steers the robot's visual attention toward task-relevant
objects and preserves precise global context, which together align the training
and testing distributions into a similar and task-informative feature space,
ultimately enhancing the robustness of the imitation learning policy.
Experiments demonstrate that GLUE achieves strong performance across diverse
tasks in both simulation and real-world settings, outperforming the strongest
baseline by 17.6% in simulation, 36.3% in real-world environments, and 58.3% on
real-world generalization settings. The project website of GLUE is available at

Abstract: Quadruped robots are designed to achieve agile locomotion by mimicking legged
animals. However, existing control methods for quadrupeds often lack one of the
key capabilities observed in animals: adaptive and adjustable compliance in
response to external disturbances. Most locomotion controllers do not provide
tunable compliance and tend to fail under large perturbations. In this work, we
propose a switched policy framework for compliant and safe quadruped
locomotion. First, we train a force compliant policy with adjustable compliance
levels using a teacher student reinforcement learning framework, eliminating
the need for explicit force sensing. Next, we develop a safe policy based on
the capture point concept to stabilize the robot when the compliant policy
fails. Finally, we introduce a recoverability network that predicts the
likelihood of failure and switches between the compliant and safe policies.
Together, this framework enables quadruped robots to achieve both force
compliance and robust safety when subjected to severe external disturbances.

Method: A2C2结合最新观测、基础动作、位置特征和基础策略特征，输出每步校正动作。

Result: 在动态任务中，A2C2显著提升成功率（+23%和+7%），并增强长时任务鲁棒性。

Conclusion: A2C2是一种高效、即插即用的机制，适用于实时控制中的高容量动作块策略。

Abstract: To improve efficiency and temporal coherence, Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models often predict action chunks; however, this action chunking harms
reactivity under inference delay and long horizons. We introduce Asynchronous
Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk
correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction
to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest
observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature
that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features
from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the
base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The
approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to
asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic
Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent
success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23%
point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves
robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the
correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the
inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an
effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in
real-time control.

Abstract: Goal Recognition (GR) is the task of inferring an agent's intended goal from
partial observations of its behavior, typically in an online and one-shot
setting. Despite recent advances in model-free GR, particularly in applications
such as human-robot interaction, surveillance, and assistive systems, the field

frameworks that support the development, evaluation, and comparison of GR
algorithms in Gym-compatible environments. gr-libs includes modular
implementations of MDP-based GR baselines, diagnostic tools, and evaluation
utilities. gr-envs provides a curated suite of environments adapted for dynamic
and goal-directed behavior, along with wrappers that ensure compatibility with
standard reinforcement learning toolkits. Together, these libraries offer a
standardized, extensible, and reproducible platform for advancing GR research.
Both packages are open-source and available on GitHub and PyPI.

Result: 在自动驾驶、海洋机器人和四足导航等领域的评估中，J-DAPT检测精度接近100%，且开销极小。

Conclusion: J-DAPT为机器人应用中的VLMs提供了一种实用的安全防御方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are
increasingly deployed in robotic environments but remain vulnerable to
jailbreaking attacks that bypass safety mechanisms and drive unsafe or
physically harmful behaviors in the real world. Data-driven defenses such as
jailbreak classifiers show promise, yet they struggle to generalize in domains
where specialized datasets are scarce, limiting their effectiveness in robotics
and other safety-critical contexts. To address this gap, we introduce J-DAPT, a
lightweight framework for multimodal jailbreak detection through
attention-based fusion and domain adaptation. J-DAPT integrates textual and
visual embeddings to capture both semantic intent and environmental grounding,
while aligning general-purpose jailbreak datasets with domain-specific
reference data. Evaluations across autonomous driving, maritime robotics, and
quadruped navigation show that J-DAPT boosts detection accuracy to nearly 100%
with minimal overhead. These results demonstrate that J-DAPT provides a
practical defense for securing VLMs in robotic applications. Additional

Abstract: Autonomous technology, which has become widespread today, appears in many
different configurations such as mobile robots, manipulators, and drones. One
of the most important tasks of these vehicles during autonomous operations is
path planning. In the literature, path planners are generally divided into two
categories: probabilistic and deterministic methods. In the analysis of
probabilistic methods, the common problem of almost all methods is observed in
narrow passage environments. In this paper, a novel sampler is proposed that
deterministically identifies narrow passage environments using occupancy grid
maps and accordingly increases the amount of sampling in these regions. The
codes of the algorithm is provided as open source. To evaluate the performance
of the algorithm, benchmark studies are conducted in three distinct categories:
specific and random simulation environments, and a real-world environment. As a
result, it is observed that our algorithm provides higher performance in
planning time and number of milestones compared to the baseline samplers.

Conclusion: 该算法在复杂环境中平衡了覆盖搜索和高精度主动跟踪，优于标准方法。

Abstract: In unknown non-convex environments, such as indoor and underground spaces,
deploying a fleet of robots to explore the surroundings while simultaneously
searching for and tracking targets of interest to maintain high-precision data
collection represents a fundamental challenge that urgently requires resolution
in applications such as environmental monitoring and rescue operations. Current
research has made significant progress in addressing environmental exploration,
information search, and target tracking problems, but has yet to establish a
framework for simultaneously optimizing these tasks in complex environments. In
this paper, we propose a novel motion planning algorithm framework that
integrates three control strategies: a frontier-based exploration strategy, a
guaranteed coverage strategy based on Lloyd's algorithm, and a sensor-based
multi-target tracking strategy. By incorporating these three strategies, the
proposed algorithm balances coverage search and high-precision active tracking
during exploration. Our approach is validated through a series of MATLAB
simulations, demonstrating validity and superiority over standard approaches.

Abstract: This paper presents the framework \textbf{GUARD} (\textbf{G}uided robot
control via \textbf{U}ncertainty attribution and prob\textbf{A}bilistic kernel
optimization for \textbf{R}isk-aware \textbf{D}ecision making) that combines
traditional control with an uncertainty-aware perception technique using active
learning with real-time capability for safe robot collision avoidance. By doing
so, this manuscript addresses the central challenge in robotics of finding a
reasonable compromise between traditional methods and learning algorithms to
foster the development of safe, yet efficient and flexible applications. By
unifying a reactive model predictive countouring control (RMPCC) with an
Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm that enables the attribution of
uncertainty sources online using active learning with real-time capability via
a probabilistic kernel optimization technique, \emph{GUARD} inherently handles
the existing ambiguity of the term \textit{safety} that exists in robotics
literature. Experimental studies indicate the high performance of \emph{GUARD},
thereby highlighting the relevance and need to broaden its applicability in
future.

Conclusion: Space Robotics Bench为开发、评估和部署太空自主系统提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: The growing ambition for space exploration demands robust autonomous systems
that can operate in unstructured environments under extreme extraterrestrial
conditions. The adoption of robot learning in this domain is severely hindered
by the prohibitive cost of technology demonstrations and the limited
availability of data. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Space Robotics
Bench, an open-source simulation framework for robot learning in space. It
offers a modular architecture that integrates on-demand procedural generation
with massively parallel simulation environments to support the creation of vast
and diverse training distributions for learning-based agents. To ground
research and enable direct comparison, the framework includes a comprehensive
suite of benchmark tasks that span a wide range of mission-relevant scenarios.
We establish performance baselines using standard reinforcement learning
algorithms and present a series of experimental case studies that investigate
key challenges in generalization, end-to-end learning, adaptive control, and
sim-to-real transfer. Our results reveal insights into the limitations of
current methods and demonstrate the utility of the framework in producing
policies capable of real-world operation. These contributions establish the
Space Robotics Bench as a valuable resource for developing, benchmarking, and
deploying the robust autonomous systems required for the final frontier.

Conclusion: 结合TRIAD的Manifold EKF能有效降低磁力计干扰，提升姿态估计精度。

Abstract: The manifold extended Kalman filter (Manifold EKF) has found extensive
application for attitude determination. Magnetometers employed as sensors for
such attitude determination are easily prone to disturbances by their
sensitivity to calibration and external magnetic fields. The TRIAD (Tri-Axial
Attitude Determination) algorithm is well known as a sub-optimal attitude
estimator. In this article, we incorporate this sub-optimal feature of the
TRIAD in mitigating the influence of the magnetometer reading in the pitch and
roll axis determination in the Manifold EKF algorithm. We substantiate our
results with experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态整合的挑战，支持增量学习并揭示了模态间的自适应转换机制。

Abstract: Effectively integrating diverse sensory modalities is crucial for robotic
manipulation. However, the typical approach of feature concatenation is often
suboptimal: dominant modalities such as vision can overwhelm sparse but
critical signals like touch in contact-rich tasks, and monolithic architectures
cannot flexibly incorporate new or missing modalities without retraining. Our
method factorizes the policy into a set of diffusion models, each specialized
for a single representation (e.g., vision or touch), and employs a router
network that learns consensus weights to adaptively combine their
contributions, enabling incremental of new representations. We evaluate our
approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world
tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle
insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines
on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning. Our policy further demonstrates
robustness to physical perturbations and sensor corruption. We further conduct
perturbation-based importance analysis, which reveals adaptive shifts between
modalities.

Conclusion: 去中心化框架能高效解决机器人协作问题，且无需大量信息交换。

Abstract: Increased robot deployment, such as in warehousing, has revealed a need for
seamless collaboration among heterogeneous robot teams to resolve unforeseen
conflicts. To address this challenge, we propose a novel decentralized
framework that enables robots to request and provide help. The process begins
when a robot detects a conflict and uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to decide
whether external assistance is required. If so, it crafts and broadcasts a
natural language (NL) help request. Potential helper robots reason over the
request and respond with offers of assistance, including information about the
effect on their ongoing tasks. Helper reasoning is implemented via an LLM
grounded in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) using a Backus-Naur Form (BNF) grammar,
ensuring syntactically valid NL-to-STL translations, which are then solved as a
Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). Finally, the requester robot selects a
helper by reasoning over the expected increase in system-level total task
completion time. We evaluated our framework through experiments comparing
different helper-selection strategies and found that considering multiple
offers allows the requester to minimize added makespan. Our approach
significantly outperforms heuristics such as selecting the nearest available
candidate helper robot, and achieves performance comparable to a centralized
"Oracle" baseline but without heavy information demands.

Conclusion: 这是首次实现六自由度软体双臂强力全身操控，并成功进行零样本策略迁移。

Abstract: Whole-body manipulation is a powerful yet underexplored approach that enables
robots to interact with large, heavy, or awkward objects using more than just
their end-effectors. Soft robots, with their inherent passive compliance, are
particularly well-suited for such contact-rich manipulation tasks, but their
uncertainties in kinematics and dynamics pose significant challenges for
simulation and control. In this work, we address this challenge with a
simulation that can run up to 350x real time on a single thread in MuJoCo and
provide a detailed analysis of the critical tradeoffs between speed and
accuracy for this simulation. Using this framework, we demonstrate a successful
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer of a learned whole-body manipulation policy,
achieving an 88% success rate on the Baloo hardware platform. We show that
guiding RL with a simple motion primitive is critical to this success where
standard reward shaping methods struggled to produce a stable and successful
policy for whole-body manipulation. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the
learned policy does not simply mimic the motion primitive. It exhibits
beneficial reactive behavior, such as re-grasping and perturbation recovery. We
analyze and contrast this learned policy against an open-loop baseline to show
that the policy can also exhibit aggressive over-corrections under
perturbation. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of forceful,
six-DoF whole-body manipulation using two continuum soft arms on a large-scale
platform (10 kg payloads), with zero-shot policy transfer.

Conclusion: 该设计为微型轴向磁通电机提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于需要高扭矩的机器人应用。

Abstract: Quasi-direct-drive (QDD) actuation is transforming legged and manipulator
robots by eliminating high-ratio gearboxes, yet it demands motors that deliver
very high torque at low speed within a thin, disc-shaped joint envelope.
Axial-flux permanent-magnet (AFPM) machines meet these geometric and torque
requirements, but scaling them below a 20mm outer diameter is hampered by poor
copper fill in conventional wound stators, inflating resistance and throttling
continuous torque. This paper introduces a micro-scale AFPM motor that
overcomes these limitations through printed-circuit-board (PCB) windings
fabricated with advanced IC-substrate high-density interconnect (HDI)
technology. The resulting 48-layer stator-formed by stacking four 12-layer HDI
modules-achieves a record 45\% copper fill in a package only 5mm thick and 19mm
in diameter. We perform comprehensive electromagnetic and thermal analyses to
inform the motor design, then fabricate a prototype whose performance
characteristics are experimentally verified.

Conclusion: RAVEN通过自适应行为切换和长期规划，显著提升了户外语义导航的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Aerial outdoor semantic navigation requires robots to explore large,
unstructured environments to locate target objects. Recent advances in semantic
navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor
settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and
structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While
outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive
policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted
behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting
adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based,
behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor
environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as
persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive
behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to
scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to
suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These
components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches
behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor
simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object
search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes.
Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and
demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot
in outdoor field tests.

Abstract: Robust and human-like dexterous grasping of general objects is a critical
capability for advancing intelligent robotic manipulation in real-world
scenarios. However, existing reinforcement learning methods guided by grasp
priors often result in unnatural behaviors. In this work, we present
\textit{ContactGrasp}, a robotic dexterous pre-grasp and grasp dataset that
explicitly accounts for task-relevant wrist orientation and thumb-index
pinching coordination. The dataset covers 773 objects in 82 categories,
providing a rich foundation for training human-like grasp strategies. Building
upon this dataset, we perform geometry-based clustering to group objects by
shape, enabling a two-stage Geometry-based Expert Selection (GES) framework
that selects among specialized experts for grasping diverse object geometries,
thereby enhancing adaptability to diverse shapes and generalization across
categories. Our approach demonstrates natural grasp postures and achieves high
success rates of 99.4\% and 96.3\% on the train and test sets, respectively,
showcasing strong generalization and high-quality grasp execution.

Conclusion: CLAP显著提升了机器人3D操作任务的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Hierarchical coarse-to-fine policy, where a coarse branch predicts a region
of interest to guide a fine-grained action predictor, has demonstrated
significant potential in robotic 3D manipulation tasks by especially enhancing
sample efficiency and enabling more precise manipulation. However, even
augmented with pre-trained models, these hierarchical policies still suffer
from generalization issues. To enhance generalization to novel instructions and
environment variations, we propose Coarse-to-fine Language-Aligned manipulation
Policy (CLAP), a framework that integrates three key components: 1) task
decomposition, 2) VLM fine-tuning for 3D keypoint prediction, and 3) 3D-aware
representation. Through comprehensive experiments in simulation and on a real
robot, we demonstrate its superior generalization capability. Specifically, on
GemBench, a benchmark designed for evaluating generalization, our approach
achieves a 12\% higher average success rate than the SOTA method while using
only 1/5 of the training trajectories. In real-world experiments, our policy,
trained on only 10 demonstrations, successfully generalizes to novel
instructions and environments.

Result: 仿真验证了该方法能有效强制执行材料安全规范。

Conclusion: 该研究为软机器人提供了可证明的安全控制框架。

Abstract: Until recently, the concept of soft robot safety was an informal notion,
often attributed solely to the fact that soft robots are less likely to damage
their operating environment than rigid robots. As the field moves toward
feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important
to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become
unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality
through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy
and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key
challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal
definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a
controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an
incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be
enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic
program-based feedback control. As a case study, we consider a pressurized
hyperelastic tube with inertial effects, first-order viscous effects, and
full-state feedback. Simulation results verify that the proposed methodology
can enforce the material safety specification.

Result: 实验表明，KiVi使四足机器人能在多样地形中稳定移动，并对训练中未见的视觉噪声和遮挡具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: KiVi框架有效提升了腿式机器人在现实环境中的运动稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: Vision-based locomotion has shown great promise in enabling legged robots to
perceive and adapt to complex environments. However, visual information is
inherently fragile, being vulnerable to occlusions, reflections, and lighting
changes, which often cause instability in locomotion. Inspired by animal
sensorimotor integration, we propose KiVi, a Kinesthetic-Visuospatial
integration framework, where kinesthetics encodes proprioceptive sensing of
body motion and visuospatial reasoning captures visual perception of
surrounding terrain. Specifically, KiVi separates these pathways, leveraging
proprioception as a stable backbone while selectively incorporating vision for
terrain awareness and obstacle avoidance. This modality-balanced, yet
integrative design, combined with memory-enhanced attention, allows the robot
to robustly interpret visual cues while maintaining fallback stability through
proprioception. Extensive experiments show that our method enables quadruped
robots to stably traverse diverse terrains and operate reliably in unstructured
outdoor environments, remaining robust to out-of-distribution (OOD) visual
noise and occlusion unseen during training, thereby highlighting its
effectiveness and applicability to real-world legged locomotion.

Conclusion: HeLoM通过协调多肢控制，实现了对重物的稳定推动，验证了其在实际环境中的有效性。

Abstract: Robots in real-world environments are often required to move/manipulate
objects comparable in weight to their own bodies. Compared to grasping and
carrying, pushing provides a more straightforward and efficient non-prehensile
manipulation strategy, avoiding complex grasp design while leveraging direct
contact to regulate an object's pose. Achieving effective pushing, however,
demands both sufficient manipulation forces and the ability to maintain
stability, which is particularly challenging when dealing with heavy or
irregular objects. To address these challenges, we propose HeLoM, a
learning-based hierarchical whole-body manipulation framework for a hexapod
robot that exploits coordinated multi-limb control. Inspired by the cooperative
strategies of multi-legged insects, our framework leverages redundant contact
points and high degrees of freedom to enable dynamic redistribution of contact
forces. HeLoM's high-level planner plans pushing behaviors and target object
poses, while its low-level controller maintains locomotion stability and
generates dynamically consistent joint actions. Our policies trained in
simulation are directly deployed on real robots without additional fine-tuning.
This design allows the robot to maintain balance while exerting continuous and
controllable pushing forces through coordinated foreleg interaction and
supportive hind-leg propulsion. We validate the effectiveness of HeLoM through
both simulation and real-world experiments. Results show that our framework can
stably push boxes of varying sizes and unknown physical properties to
designated goal poses in the real world.

Result: Oat-VLA在LIBERO套件上收敛速度至少是OpenVLA的两倍，并在真实世界拾取任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: Oat-VLA通过高效标记化方案，显著提升了VLA模型的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models offer a pivotal approach to learning
robotic manipulation at scale by repurposing large pre-trained
Vision-Language-Models (VLM) to output robotic actions. However, adapting VLMs
for robotic domains comes with an unnecessarily high computational cost, which
we attribute to the tokenization scheme of visual inputs. In this work, we aim
to enable efficient VLA training by proposing Oat-VLA, an Object-Agent-centric
Tokenization for VLAs. Building on the insights of object-centric
representation learning, our method introduces an inductive bias towards scene
objects and the agent's own visual information. As a result, we find that
Oat-VLA can drastically reduce the number of visual tokens to just a few tokens
without sacrificing performance. We reveal that Oat-VLA converges at least
twice as fast as OpenVLA on the LIBERO suite, as well as outperform OpenVLA in
diverse real-world pick and place tasks.

Result: 在PnP估计、手眼标定和双机器人系统标定等任务中展示了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 固定迹约束的SDP框架为机器人学中的非凸问题提供了高效的全局优化解决方案。

Abstract: Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations
via semidefinite programming (SDP), which offers the advantage of global
optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically
depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires
additional tightening. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs, where
the decision variables are positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with fixed
trace values. These additional constraints not only capture important
structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering
rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints
to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations,
which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To
further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement
procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost
candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual
problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this
trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through
simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and
dual-robot system calibration. To support broader use, we also introduce a
modular ``virtual robot'' abstraction that simplifies modeling across different
problem settings.

Conclusion: MDCPP有效解决了传统方法的不足，提升了多机器人覆盖任务的效率和均衡性。

Abstract: Multi-robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) addresses the problem of computing
paths for multiple robots to effectively cover a large area of interest.
Conventional approaches to MCPP typically assume that robots move at fixed
velocities, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications where robots
must adapt their speeds based on the specific coverage tasks assigned to
them.Consequently, conventional approaches often lead to imbalanced workload
distribution among robots and increased completion time for coverage tasks. To
address this, we introduce a novel Multi-robot Dynamic Coverage Path Planning
(MDCPP) algorithm for complete coverage in two-dimensional environments. MDCPP
dynamically estimates each robot's remaining workload by approximating the
target distribution with Gaussian mixture models, and assigns coverage regions
using a capacity-constrained Voronoi diagram. We further develop a distributed
implementation of MDCPP for range-constrained robotic networks. Simulation
results validate the efficacy of MDCPP, showing qualitative improvements and
superior performance compared to an existing sweeping algorithm, and a

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态感知的运动生成框架DA-MMP，用于目标导向的动态操作任务，并在环抛任务中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖手动设计的动作参数化，难以生成复杂任务所需的高度协调运动；运动规划虽能生成可行轨迹，但动态差距导致执行偏差大。

Method: 扩展运动流形基元至变长轨迹，通过紧凑参数化学习高质量流形，并基于条件流匹配模型生成考虑执行动态的投掷轨迹。

Result: 实验表明DA-MMP能生成协调平滑的运动轨迹，在真实环抛任务中成功率高，甚至超越人类专家，并能泛化至训练范围外的新目标。

Conclusion: DA-MMP成功学习了轨迹-动态映射，为动态操作任务提供了高效的运动生成解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation is a key capability for advancing robot performance,
enabling skills such as tossing. While recent learning-based approaches have
pushed the field forward, most methods still rely on manually designed action
parameterizations, limiting their ability to produce the highly coordinated
motions required in complex tasks. Motion planning can generate feasible
trajectories, but the dynamics gap-stemming from control inaccuracies, contact
uncertainties, and aerodynamic effects-often causes large deviations between
planned and executed trajectories. In this work, we propose Dynamics-Aware
Motion Manifold Primitives (DA-MMP), a motion generation framework for
goal-conditioned dynamic manipulation, and instantiate it on a challenging
real-world ring-tossing task. Our approach extends motion manifold primitives
to variable-length trajectories through a compact parametrization and learns a
high-quality manifold from a large-scale dataset of planned motions. Building
on this manifold, a conditional flow matching model is trained in the latent
space with a small set of real-world trials, enabling the generation of
throwing trajectories that account for execution dynamics. Experiments show
that our method can generate coordinated and smooth motion trajectories for the
ring-tossing task. In real-world evaluations, it achieves high success rates
and even surpasses the performance of trained human experts. Moreover, it
generalizes to novel targets beyond the training range, indicating that it
successfully learns the underlying trajectory-dynamics mapping.

Result: LocoFormer能够适应形态和动态变化，甚至在极端情况下表现出跨回合的适应性学习。

Conclusion: LocoFormer展示了通用运动控制的潜力，未来可推广到其他机器人技能的基础模型训练。

Abstract: Modern locomotion controllers are manually tuned for specific embodiments. We
present LocoFormer, a generalist omni-bodied locomotion model that can control
previously unseen legged and wheeled robots, even without precise knowledge of
their kinematics. LocoFormer is able to adapt to changes in morphology and
dynamics at test time. We find that two key choices enable adaptation. First,
we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive
domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic
with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span
episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show
robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor
failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes,
LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in
later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to
train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at

*Zeyuan Zhang,Chaoran Li,Shao Zhang,Ying Wen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Transformer的Sequential Pathfinder (SePar)方法，用于解决多智能体拾取和配送（MAPD）问题，通过序列建模降低决策复杂度并保持全局感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法在狭窄通道和长走廊的仓库环境中表现不佳，且点对点通信计算复杂度高。

Method: 将MAPF建模为序列问题，利用Transformer实现隐式信息交换，降低复杂度。

Result: SePar在多种MAPF任务中表现优于现有方法，并能泛化到新环境。

Conclusion: 在复杂地图（如仓库）中，结合模仿学习是必要的。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery (MAPD) is a challenging extension of
Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF), where agents are required to sequentially
complete tasks with fixed-location pickup and delivery demands. Although
learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in
warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when
relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making.
Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but
introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To
address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and
prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess
order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on
this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the
Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing
decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining
efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar
consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF
tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments.
Furthermore, we highlight the necessity of integrating imitation learning in
complex maps like warehouses.

Abstract: To address the need for high-precision localization of climbing robots in
complex high-altitude environments, this paper proposes a multi-sensor fusion
system that overcomes the limitations of single-sensor approaches. Firstly, the
localization scenarios and the problem model are analyzed. An integrated
architecture of Attention Mechanism-based Fusion Algorithm (AMFA) incorporating
planar array Ultra-Wideband (UWB), GPS, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and
barometer is designed to handle challenges such as GPS occlusion and UWB
Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS) problem. Then, End-to-end neural network inference
models for UWB and barometer are developed, along with a multimodal attention
mechanism for adaptive data fusion. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is applied
to refine the trajectory, improving accuracy and robustness. Finally,
real-world experiments show that the method achieves 0.48 m localization
accuracy and lower MAX error of 1.50 m, outperforming baseline algorithms such
as GPS/INS-EKF and demonstrating stronger robustness.

trained on data gathered by Control Your Robot match expert demonstrations
closely, indicating that the framework enables scalable and reproducible robot

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 灵巧操作对机器人应用至关重要，但现有数据集稀缺且多样性不足，限制了其扩展性和泛化能力。

Method: 结合模仿学习（IL）、残差强化学习（RL）、轨迹收集和数据增强，形成闭环自改进循环。

Result: 生成2000多个多样化演示，策略在测试集上平均成功率达81.9%，并在真实世界中实现78.3%的成功率。

Conclusion: DexFlyWheel通过自改进循环有效提升数据多样性和策略性能，适用于复杂任务和真实场景。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation is critical for advancing robot capabilities in
real-world applications, yet diverse and high-quality datasets remain scarce.
Existing data collection methods either rely on human teleoperation or require
significant human engineering, or generate data with limited diversity, which
restricts their scalability and generalization. In this paper, we introduce
DexFlyWheel, a scalable data generation framework that employs a self-improving
cycle to continuously enrich data diversity. Starting from efficient seed
demonstrations warmup, DexFlyWheel expands the dataset through iterative
cycles. Each cycle follows a closed-loop pipeline that integrates Imitation
Learning (IL), residual Reinforcement Learning (RL), rollout trajectory
collection, and data augmentation. Specifically, IL extracts human-like
behaviors from demonstrations, and residual RL enhances policy generalization.
The learned policy is then used to generate trajectories in simulation, which
are further augmented across diverse environments and spatial configurations
before being fed back into the next cycle. Over successive iterations, a
self-improving data flywheel effect emerges, producing datasets that cover
diverse scenarios and thereby scaling policy performance. Experimental results
demonstrate that DexFlyWheel generates over 2,000 diverse demonstrations across
four challenging tasks. Policies trained on our dataset achieve an average
success rate of 81.9\% on the challenge test sets and successfully transfer to
the real world through digital twin, achieving a 78.3\% success rate on
dual-arm lift tasks.

TL;DR: MAD-PINN是一个去中心化的物理信息机器学习框架，用于解决多智能体状态约束最优控制问题，实现了安全性和性能的协同优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模多智能体系统中安全性和性能的协同优化是一个基本挑战，现有方法缺乏严格的安全保证、过于保守或难以扩展。

Method: 通过基于epigraph的SC-OCP重构，利用物理信息神经网络近似解，并通过减少智能体系统训练和去中心化部署实现扩展。

Result: 实验表明，MAD-PINN在多智能体导航任务中实现了优越的安全-性能权衡，并随着智能体数量增加保持可扩展性。

Conclusion: MAD-PINN在安全性和性能方面优于现有方法，适用于大规模多智能体系统。

Abstract: Co-optimizing safety and performance in large-scale multi-agent systems
remains a fundamental challenge. Existing approaches based on multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control
(MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail
to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed
machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained
optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based
reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and
approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is
achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and
deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on
local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance
safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based
neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a
receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions
while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation
tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance
trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: Flash是一种轻量级视觉地点识别（VPR）系统，利用亚毫秒级事件数据实现快速地点识别，显著提升了现有基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的VPR方法依赖密集表示且需要较长时间数据，Flash旨在突破这一限制，实现更快速的地点识别。

Method: Flash通过高效二进制帧编码活跃像素位置，利用快速位运算计算相似度，并根据事件活动性进行归一化。

Result: 在QCR-Event-Dataset和Brisbane-Event-VPR数据集上，Recall@1分别提升11.33倍和5.92倍，并降低了定位延迟（TCM）。

Conclusion: Flash首次实现了基于事件相机的亚毫秒级VPR，显著提升了系统响应速度和定位效率。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables systems to identify previously visited
locations within a map, a fundamental task for autonomous navigation. Prior
works have developed VPR solutions using event cameras, which asynchronously
measure per-pixel brightness changes with microsecond temporal resolution.
However, these approaches rely on dense representations of the inherently
sparse camera output and require tens to hundreds of milliseconds of event data
to predict a place. Here, we break this paradigm with Flash, a lightweight VPR
system that predicts places using sub-millisecond slices of event data. Our
method is based on the observation that active pixel locations provide strong
discriminative features for VPR. Flash encodes these active pixel locations
using efficient binary frames and computes similarities via fast bitwise
operations, which are then normalized based on the relative event activity in
the query and reference frames. Flash improves Recall@1 for sub-millisecond VPR
over existing baselines by 11.33x on the indoor QCR-Event-Dataset and 5.92x on
the 8 km Brisbane-Event-VPR dataset. Moreover, our approach reduces the
duration for which the robot must operate without awareness of its position, as
evidenced by a localization latency metric we term Time to Correct Match (TCM).
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate
sub-millisecond VPR using event cameras.

Result: 在模拟和真实多模态环境中验证，性能优于其他多样性维护算法。

Conclusion: 该方法在多模态环境中表现稳健，成功率高且不影响紧凑性。

Abstract: We propose a method for linear-time diversity maintenance in particle
filtering. It clusters particles based on ancestry tree topology: closely
related particles in sufficiently large subtrees are grouped together. The main
idea is that the tree structure implicitly encodes similarity without the need
for spatial or other domain-specific metrics. This approach, when combined with
intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a
cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments
while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a
multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment.
We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the
literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.
Our algorithm achieves high success rates with little to no negative effect on
compactness, showing particular robustness to different domains and challenging
initial conditions.

Abstract: Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its
emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as
precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV
problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted
environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and
processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in
many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the
placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more
informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective
reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view
planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location
of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to
generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need
for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present
work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction
quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of
`structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought
environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the
optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian
optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using
only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases.
Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the
benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal
camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and
generalize well on similar unknown environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数机器人操作关注物体的运动状态变化，但许多实际任务涉及物体物理和视觉状态的渐进变化（如捣碎、涂抹或切片），需要新的方法。

Method: SPARTA利用空间进展的物体变化分割图，生成结构化策略观察和密集奖励，支持强化学习和贪婪控制两种策略。

Result: 在10种不同物体上验证了SPARTA的有效性，相比稀疏奖励和视觉目标条件基线，训练时间和准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: SPARTA展示了基于视觉表示的通用性，为物体状态操作任务提供了新基础。

Abstract: Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects:
picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of
real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state
change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and
visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We
present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state
change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common
structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes
that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a
transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially
progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive
actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to
generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance
variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time.
These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for
fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control
for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three
challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant
improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual
goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual
representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object
state manipulation tasks. Project website:

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new modeling approach and a fast algorithm for 3D
motion planning, applicable for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles. The goal
is to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final
configurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing
literature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a
body-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However,
existing work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to
uniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent
bounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In
contrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature,
which is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D.
We use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and
its evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on
spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces. Numerical simulations show our
approach generates feasible paths within 10 seconds on average and yields
shorter paths than existing methods in most cases.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM方法在新环境中适应性差、依赖固定提示或单次代码生成的问题。

Conclusion: MTP利用程序知识实现跨多样机器人操作场景的稳健规划，提升新环境适应性并弥合仿真与现实部署的差距。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation,
but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems
require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts
and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual
re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that
leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as
procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven
planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs,
(ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii)
contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning
without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a
physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these
settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with
fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning.
Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in
simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits
procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse
robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments
and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.

Conclusion: 多模态LLM微调方法有效提升了长期机器人堆叠任务的规划能力。

Abstract: Pretrained large language models (LLMs) can work as high-level robotic
planners by reasoning over abstract task descriptions and natural language
instructions, etc. However, they have shown a lack of knowledge and
effectiveness in planning long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks where the
physical properties of the objects are essential. An example is the stacking of
containers with hidden objects inside, which involves reasoning over hidden
physics properties such as weight and stability. To this end, this paper
proposes to use multimodal LLMs as high-level planners for such long-horizon
robotic stacking tasks. The LLM takes multimodal inputs for each object to
stack and infers the current best stacking sequence by reasoning over stacking
preferences. Furthermore, in order to enable the LLM to reason over multiple
preferences at the same time without giving explicit instructions, we propose
to create a custom dataset considering stacking preferences including weight,
stability, size, and footprint, to fine-tune the LLM. Compared to the
pretrained LLM with prompt tuning, we demonstrate the improved stacking
completion of the LLM fine-tuned with our custom dataset via large-scale
simulation evaluation. Furthermore, we showcase the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for the long-horizon stacking task on a real humanoid robot
in an online manner.

Abstract: Torque control enables agile and robust robot motion, but deployment is often
hindered by instability and hardware limits. Here, we present a novel solution
to execute whole-body linear feedback at up to 40 kHz on open-source hardware.
We use this to interpolate non-linear schemes during real-world execution, such
as inverse dynamics and learned torque policies. Our results show that by
stabilizing torque controllers, high-frequency linear feedback could be an
effective route towards unlocking the potential of torque-controlled robotics.

TL;DR: ViReSkill结合视觉重规划和技能记忆，提升机器人任务适应性和执行可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL/IL方法适应新任务慢，LLMs/VLMs虽知识丰富但缺乏场景几何和物理基础，且输出不稳定。

Method: ViReSkill通过视觉重规划生成新动作序列，成功执行的计划存入技能记忆供未来复用。

Result: 在LIBERO、RLBench仿真和真实机器人上，ViReSkill任务成功率均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ViReSkill实现了自主持续学习，提升了任务成功率和仿真到现实的泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Imitation Learning (IL)
often adapt slowly to new tasks, whereas recent Large Language Models (LLMs)
and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) promise knowledge-rich planning from minimal
data. Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key
obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object
physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining
execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs
vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When
a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on
the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed
plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without
additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual
learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes
subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and
RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently
outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust
sim-to-real generalization.

### [424] [Towards Tighter Convex Relaxation of Mixed-integer Programs: Leveraging Logic Network Flow for Task and Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24235)
*Xuan Lin,Jiming Ren,Yandong Luo,Weijun Xie,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于优化的任务和运动规划框架“Logic Network Flow”，将时序逻辑规范集成到混合整数程序中，显著提升了机器人规划的效率和实时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Logic Tree方法在处理时序逻辑规范时效率较低，因此需要一种更高效的规划框架。

Method: 通过将时序谓词编码为网络流模型边上的多面体约束，并提出了基于网络流的Fourier-Motzkin消元法，减少了连续流变量，同时保持了凸松弛的紧致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在车辆路径规划、多机器人协调和时序逻辑控制等任务中，计算速度提升了数个数量级，并在四足机器人硬件上验证了实时重新规划能力。

Conclusion: Logic Network Flow框架在效率和实时性上优于传统方法，适用于动态环境下的机器人规划。

Abstract: This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework,
named "Logic Network Flow", that integrates temporal logic specifications into
mixed-integer programs for efficient robot planning. Inspired by the
Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron
constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints
between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a
network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes
continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading
to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree
formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic
systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot
coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass
and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to
several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots
validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing
environmental conditions. The project website is at

Motivation: 现有RGB-D SLAM系统在大视角变化、快速运动或突然抖动时失效，学习与优化方法各有不足。

Method: 使用相机位姿回归网络预测相对位姿，结合随机优化算法细化深度图像对齐。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中表现优异，实时运行且保持稳定运动序列的精度。

Conclusion: 结合简单原理技术，实现不稳定运动的鲁棒性和稠密重建的准确性。

Abstract: Real-time dense scene reconstruction during unstable camera motions is
crucial for robotics, yet current RGB-D SLAM systems fail when cameras
experience large viewpoint changes, fast motions, or sudden shaking. Classical
optimization-based methods deliver high accuracy but fail with poor
initialization during large motions, while learning-based approaches provide
robustness but lack sufficient accuracy for dense reconstruction. We address
this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with
optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression
network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames,
which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm
that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments
demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on
challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion
sequences. The system operates in real-time, showcasing that combining simple
and principled techniques can achieve both robustness for unstable motions and
accuracy for dense reconstruction. Project page:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SafeFlowMatcher结合流匹配与控制屏障函数，实现实时高效与安全认证的路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式规划器在约束附近可能产生不完整路径且缺乏安全保证的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段预测-校正积分器：预测阶段生成候选路径，校正阶段通过CBF优化微调路径。

Result: 在迷宫导航和运动基准测试中，SafeFlowMatcher生成更快、更平滑且更安全的路径。

Conclusion: SafeFlowMatcher通过PC积分器和屏障证书，有效避免分布漂移和局部陷阱问题。

Abstract: Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality
paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal
safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present
SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier
functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety.
SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a
prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a
candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path
with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program
that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for
the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set
and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the
executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher
avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze
navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother,
and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations
corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自适应控制器在多变环境中需要大量调参，且难以适应变化条件。机器学习方法虽有效，但数据收集成本高且不高效。

Method: 采用贝叶斯优化和高斯过程，动态选择关键环境上下文进行数据收集，优化神经网络的参数调整能力。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在最大绝对位置误差上优于现有方法20.3%，且能通过少量上下文捕捉环境变化。

Conclusion: Contextual NeuroMHE方法显著提升了控制器的适应性和效率，适用于多变环境中的鲁棒控制。

Abstract: Adaptive controllers on quadrotors typically rely on estimation of
disturbances to ensure robust trajectory tracking. Estimating disturbances
across diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent
variability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require
extensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and
brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a
neural network to tune the estimator's parameters, are promising. However,
collecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is
also inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for "nearby"
contexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that
decides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a
Gaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance
across a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates
the need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining
robust performance under different conditions. By enabling the neural network
to adapt its parameters dynamically, our method improves both efficiency and
generalization. Experimental results in various real-world settings demonstrate
that our approach outperforms the prior work by 20.3\% in terms of maximum
absolute position error and can capture the variations in the environment with
a few carefully chosen contexts.

Motivation: 在复杂城市场景中，传统均匀或启发式采样方法常产生大量不可行或不相关的轨迹，限制了运动规划的效率和可靠性。

Method: 采用强化学习（RL）引导采样过程，结合可解码的深度集合编码器（WM）处理动态交通参与者，保持轨迹生成和评估的解析性和可验证性。

Result: 在CommonRoad仿真环境中，样本需求减少99%，运行时间降低84%，同时保持成功率和无碰撞率。

Conclusion: 该方法提升了自动驾驶车辆在城市环境中的决策速度和可靠性，实现了更安全和响应更快的导航。

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planning is a well-established approach in autonomous
driving, valued for its modularity and analytical tractability. In complex
urban scenarios, however, uniform or heuristic sampling often produces many
infeasible or irrelevant trajectories. We address this limitation with a hybrid
framework that learns where to sample while keeping trajectory generation and
evaluation fully analytical and verifiable. A reinforcement learning (RL) agent
guides the sampling process toward regions of the action space likely to yield
feasible trajectories, while evaluation and final selection remains governed by
deterministic feasibility checks and cost functions. We couple the RL sampler
with a world model (WM) based on a decodable deep set encoder, enabling both
variable numbers of traffic participants and reconstructable latent
representations. The approach is evaluated in the CommonRoad simulation
environment, showing up to 99% fewer required samples and a runtime reduction
of up to 84% while maintaining planning quality in terms of success and
collision-free rates. These improvements lead to faster, more reliable
decision-making for autonomous vehicles in urban environments, achieving safer
and more responsive navigation under real-world constraints. Code and trained

Motivation: 现有模块化方法依赖训练数据质量且泛化能力差，而基于视觉语言模型的方法在语义线索弱时表现不佳。

Method: 提出SONAR方法，集成语义地图目标预测模块和视觉语言模型价值地图模块，并采用多尺度语义图与置信度图结合的策略。

Result: 在Gazebo模拟器和MP3D数据集上测试，SONAR成功率为38.4%，SPL为17.7%。

Conclusion: SONAR有效平衡泛化能力和场景适应性，提升弱语义环境下的导航鲁棒性。

Abstract: Understanding human instructions and accomplishing Vision-Language Navigation
tasks in unknown environments is essential for robots. However, existing
modular approaches heavily rely on the quality of training data and often
exhibit poor generalization. Vision-Language Model based methods, while
demonstrating strong generalization capabilities, tend to perform
unsatisfactorily when semantic cues are weak. To address these issues, this
paper proposes SONAR, an aggregated reasoning approach through a cross modal
paradigm. The proposed method integrates a semantic map based target prediction
module with a Vision-Language Model based value map module, enabling more
robust navigation in unknown environments with varying levels of semantic cues,
and effectively balancing generalization ability with scene adaptability. In
terms of target localization, we propose a strategy that integrates multi-scale
semantic maps with confidence maps, aiming to mitigate false detections of
target objects. We conducted an evaluation of the SONAR within the Gazebo
simulator, leveraging the most challenging Matterport 3D (MP3D) dataset as the
experimental benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate that SONAR achieves a
success rate of 38.4% and an SPL of 17.7%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 固定步长的推理可能导致性能不佳和计算浪费，因此需要自适应推理来增强时间一致性和感知-动作对齐。

Method: 提出Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block（UAR），通过动作熵作为策略先验，并结合启发式到强化学习的训练方法。

Result: 仅用6K训练样本，AdaNav在多个数据集上显著提升成功率，如R2R val-unseen（20%）、RxR-CE（11.7%）和真实场景（11.4%）。

Conclusion: AdaNav在数据有限的情况下，通过自适应推理实现了优于大规模数据训练模型的性能。

Abstract: Vision Language Navigation (VLN) requires agents to follow natural language
instructions by grounding them in sequential visual observations over long
horizons. Explicit reasoning could enhance temporal consistency and perception
action alignment, but reasoning at fixed steps often leads to suboptimal
performance and unnecessary computation. To address this, we propose AdaNav, an
uncertainty-based adaptive reasoning framework for VLN. At its core is the
Uncertainty Adaptive Reasoning Block (UAR), a lightweight plugin that
dynamically triggers reasoning. We introduce Action Entropy as a policy prior
for UAR and progressively refine it through a Heuristics to RL training method,
enabling agents to learn difficulty aware reasoning policies under the strict
data limitations of embodied tasks. Results show that with only 6K training
samples, AdaNav achieves substantial gains over closed source models trained on
million scale data, improving success rate by 20% on R2R val-unseen, 11.7% on
RxR-CE, and 11.4% in real world scenes. The code is available at

Result: 通过语义级实验和消融研究验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: DynaMIC能帮助机器人敏感识别潜在DCFs，提升任务执行的可靠性。

Abstract: The emergence of large pre-trained models based on natural language has
breathed new life into robotics development. Extensive research has integrated
large models with robots, utilizing the powerful semantic understanding and
generation capabilities of large models to facilitate robot control through
natural language instructions gradually. However, we found that robots that
strictly adhere to human instructions, especially those containing misleading
information, may encounter errors during task execution, potentially leading to
safety hazards. This resembles the concept of counterfactuals in natural
language processing (NLP), which has not yet attracted much attention in
robotic research. In an effort to highlight this issue for future studies, this
paper introduced directive counterfactuals (DCFs) arising from misleading human
directives. We present DynaMIC, a framework for generating robot task flows to
identify DCFs and relay feedback to humans proactively. This capability can
help robots be sensitive to potential DCFs within a task, thus enhancing the
reliability of the execution process. We conducted semantic-level experiments
and ablation studies, showcasing the effectiveness of this framework.

Conclusion: PhysiAgent为VLM和VLA的集成提供了实用方案，有效应用于现实场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved notable success but often
struggle with limited generalizations. To address this, integrating generalized
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as assistants to VLAs has emerged as a popular
solution. However, current approaches often combine these models in rigid,
sequential structures: using VLMs primarily for high-level scene understanding
and task planning, and VLAs merely as executors of lower-level actions, leading
to ineffective collaboration and poor grounding challenges. In this paper, we
propose an embodied agent framework, PhysiAgent, tailored to operate
effectively in physical environments. By incorporating monitor, memory,
self-reflection mechanisms, and lightweight off-the-shelf toolboxes, PhysiAgent
offers an autonomous scaffolding framework to prompt VLMs to organize different
components based on real-time proficiency feedback from VLAs to maximally
exploit VLAs' capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks,
showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and
adaptive evolution of the framework during execution. PhysiAgent makes
practical and pioneering efforts to integrate VLMs and VLAs, effectively
grounding embodied agent frameworks in real-world settings.

Abstract: In this study, we explore the potential of Game Theory as a means to

introduce the Public Good Game (PGG), a model highlighting the tension between
individual self-interest and collective well-being. In this work, we present a
modified version of the PGG, where three human participants engage in the game
with the humanoid robot iCub to assess whether various robot game strategies
(e.g., always cooperate, always free ride, and tit-for-tat) can influence the
participants' inclination to cooperate. We test our setup during a pilot study
with nineteen participants. A preliminary analysis indicates that participants
prefer not to invest their money in the common pool, despite they perceive the
robot as generous. By conducting this research, we seek to gain valuable
insights into the role that robots can play in promoting trust and cohesion
during human-robot interactions within group contexts. The results of this
study may hold considerable potential for developing social robots capable of
fostering trust and cooperation within mixed human-robot groups.

Conclusion: 离策略模仿学习框架在机器人运动生成中具有潜力。

Abstract: Learning-based methods have enabled robots to acquire bio-inspired movements
with increasing levels of naturalness and adaptability. Among these, Imitation
Learning (IL) has proven effective in transferring complex motion patterns from
animals to robotic systems. However, current state-of-the-art frameworks
predominantly rely on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), an on-policy
algorithm that prioritizes stability over sample efficiency and policy
generalization. This paper proposes a novel IL framework that combines
Adversarial Motion Priors (AMP) with the off-policy Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
algorithm to overcome these limitations. This integration leverages
replay-driven learning and entropy-regularized exploration, enabling
naturalistic behavior and task execution, improving data efficiency and
robustness. We evaluate the proposed approach (AMP+SAC) on quadruped gaits
involving multiple reference motions and diverse terrains. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed framework not only maintains stable task
execution but also achieves higher imitation rewards compared to the widely
used AMP+PPO method. These findings highlight the potential of an off-policy IL
formulation for advancing motion generation in robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with
high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use
the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in
understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these
for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an
individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and
must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework
that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and
semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time
operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented
as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks
(RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and
sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an
RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By
training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the
hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots
to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present
evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various
simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and
collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.

Result: 在仿真和真实机器人任务中，U-DiT分别比基线方法提升10%和22.5%，并在干扰和光照变化下表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: U-DiT Policy作为扩散机器人操作的新基础，展示了其有效性和实际潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods have been acknowledged as a powerful paradigm for
end-to-end visuomotor control in robotics. Most existing approaches adopt a
Diffusion Policy in U-Net architecture (DP-U), which, while effective, suffers
from limited global context modeling and over-smoothing artifacts. To address
these issues, we propose U-DiT Policy, a novel U-shaped Diffusion Transformer
framework. U-DiT preserves the multi-scale feature fusion advantages of U-Net
while integrating the global context modeling capability of Transformers,
thereby enhancing representational power and policy expressiveness. We evaluate
U-DiT extensively across both simulation and real-world robotic manipulation
tasks. In simulation, U-DiT achieves an average performance gain of 10\% over
baseline methods and surpasses Transformer-based diffusion policies (DP-T) that
use AdaLN blocks by 6\% under comparable parameter budgets. On real-world
robotic tasks, U-DiT demonstrates superior generalization and robustness,
achieving an average improvement of 22.5\% over DP-U. In addition, robustness
and generalization experiments under distractor and lighting variations further
highlight the advantages of U-DiT. These results highlight the effectiveness
and practical potential of U-DiT Policy as a new foundation for diffusion-based
robotic manipulation.

Conclusion: PoseDiff为具身AI中的感知、规划和控制提供了可扩展、准确且高效的桥梁。

Abstract: We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state
estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps
raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or
joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage
pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff
extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on
sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and
continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy.
This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception
and control. On the DREAM dataset, PoseDiff achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
and real-time performance for pose estimation. On Libero-Object manipulation
tasks, it substantially improves success rates over existing inverse dynamics

Abstract: Cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis refers to adaptively generating
and optimizing grasps for various robotic hands with different morphologies.
This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in
diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse
grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However,
existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks
human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection
processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we
propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at
scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning
robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given
an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first
generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational
Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human
contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human
hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance
field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we
construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K
objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps. Extensive experiments
show that CEDex outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and our dataset
benefits cross-embodiment grasp learning with high-quality diverse grasps.

Result: 在ergoCub人形机器人上验证，显著提升了轨迹准确性和物理约束符合性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合物理知识和控制原理，提升了人形机器人运动的稳定性和真实性。

Abstract: Recent trends in humanoid robot control have successfully employed imitation
learning to enable the learned generation of smooth, human-like trajectories
from human data. While these approaches make more realistic motions possible,
they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate
prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its
interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to
divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability.
We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages
the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we
encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote
trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying
a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We
validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid
robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity. Our
experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach is compatible with multiple
controllers on a real robot and significantly improves the accuracy and
physical constraint conformity of generated trajectories.

Conclusion: LLM-Handover实现更直观、上下文感知的交接，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration depends on task-oriented handovers, where
robots present objects in ways that support the partners intended use. However,
many existing approaches neglect the humans post-handover action, relying on
assumptions that limit generalizability. To address this gap, we propose
LLM-Handover, a novel framework that integrates large language model
(LLM)-based reasoning with part segmentation to enable context-aware grasp
selection and execution. Given an RGB-D image and a task description, our
system infers relevant object parts and selects grasps that optimize
post-handover usability. To support evaluation, we introduce a new dataset of
60 household objects spanning 12 categories, each annotated with detailed part
labels. We first demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of the
used state-of-the-art part segmentation method, in the context of robot-human
handovers. Next, we show that LLM-Handover achieves higher grasp success rates
and adapts better to post-handover task constraints. During hardware
experiments, we achieve a success rate of 83% in a zero-shot setting over
conventional and unconventional post-handover tasks. Finally, our user study
underlines that our method enables more intuitive, context-aware handovers,
with participants preferring it in 86% of cases.

Conclusion: APREBot为四足机器人在安全关键场景中提供了可靠的自主性解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable onboard perception is critical for quadruped robots navigating
dynamic environments, where obstacles can emerge from any direction under
strict reaction-time constraints. Single-sensor systems face inherent
limitations: LiDAR provides omnidirectional coverage but lacks rich texture
information, while cameras capture high-resolution detail but suffer from
restricted field of view. We introduce APREBot (Active Perception System for
Reflexive Evasion Robot), a novel framework that integrates reflexive evasion
with active hierarchical perception. APREBot strategically combines LiDAR-based
omnidirectional scanning with camera-based active focusing, achieving
comprehensive environmental awareness essential for agile obstacle avoidance in
quadruped robots. We validate APREBot through extensive sim-to-real experiments
on a quadruped platform, evaluating diverse obstacle types, trajectories, and
approach directions. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines in both safety metrics and operational efficiency,
highlighting APREBot's potential for dependable autonomy in safety-critical
scenarios. Videos are available at https://sites.google.com/view/aprebot/

Motivation: 解决零样本物体导航中语义引导不足和空间记忆受限导致的探索效率低和局部区域困住问题。

Method: 提出SSR-ZSON方法，结合TARE分层探索框架，采用视角生成策略平衡空间覆盖和语义密度，并引入LLM全局引导机制。

Result: 在Matterport3D和Habitat-Matterport3D数据集上，SSR-ZSON的成功率分别提高了18.5%和11.2%，SPL指标提升了0.181和0.140。

Conclusion: SSR-ZSON通过优化探索策略和全局引导，显著提升了零样本物体导航的性能和实时性。

Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation in unknown environments presents significant
challenges, mainly due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic guidance
leads to inefficient exploration, while limited spatial memory resulting from
environmental structure causes entrapment in local regions. To address these
issues, we propose SSR-ZSON, a spatial-semantic relative zero-shot object
navigation method based on the TARE hierarchical exploration framework,
integrating a viewpoint generation strategy balancing spatial coverage and
semantic density with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism. The performance
improvement of the proposed method is due to two key innovations. First, the
viewpoint generation strategy prioritizes areas of high semantic density within
traversable sub-regions to maximize spatial coverage and minimize invalid
exploration. Second, coupled with an LLM-based global guidance mechanism, it
assesses semantic associations to direct navigation toward high-value spaces,
preventing local entrapment and ensuring efficient exploration. Deployed on
hybrid Habitat-Gazebo simulations and physical platforms, SSR-ZSON achieves
real-time operation and superior performance. On Matterport3D and
Habitat-Matterport3D datasets, it improves the Success Rate(SR) by 18.5\% and
11.2\%, and the Success weighted by Path Length(SPL) by 0.181 and 0.140,
respectively, over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型因实时性需求限制了语言模型规模，难以处理复杂语言指令。

Method: 利用大型视觉语言模型预处理生成上下文，增强VLA输入。

Result: 实验表明，增强后的VLA在视觉重复对象任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: IA-VLA有效提升了VLA在复杂语言指令下的理解和操作能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have become an increasingly popular
approach for addressing robot manipulation problems in recent years. However,
such models need to output actions at a rate suitable for robot control, which
limits the size of the language model they can be based on, and consequently,
their language understanding capabilities. Manipulation tasks may require
complex language instructions, such as identifying target objects by their
relative positions, to specify human intention. Therefore, we introduce IA-VLA,
a framework that utilizes the extensive language understanding of a large
vision language model as a pre-processing stage to generate improved context to
augment the input of a VLA. We evaluate the framework on a set of semantically
complex tasks which have been underexplored in VLA literature, namely tasks
involving visual duplicates, i.e., visually indistinguishable objects. A
dataset of three types of scenes with duplicate objects is used to compare a
baseline VLA against two augmented variants. The experiments show that the VLA
benefits from the augmentation scheme, especially when faced with language
instructions that require the VLA to extrapolate from concepts it has seen in
the demonstrations. For the code, dataset, and videos, see

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CIFT的框架，通过优化数据组合来提升机器人策略的泛化能力，避免了传统数据增强方法中信息保真度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉同质数据集训练的机器人策略容易受到捷径学习的影响，导致分布外泛化能力下降。传统生成数据增强方法虽然增加了多样性，但可能牺牲信息保真度。

Method: 提出了CIFT框架，将数据组合视为优化问题，利用特征空间几何作为信息保真度的代理指标，识别训练稳定性下降的“退相干点”。同时开发了MVAug生成引擎，合成因果解耦的数据谱。

Result: 在π₀和Diffusion Policy等策略架构上应用CIFT，分布外成功率提高了54%以上。

Conclusion: 信息保真度感知的数据组合是开发鲁棒通用机器人的重要因素，而不仅仅是数据合成本身。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale, visually homogeneous
datasets can be susceptible to shortcut learning, which impairs their
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. While generative data augmentation is
a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data
composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning
signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of
information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on
principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information
Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an
optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity
based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the
identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where
training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine,
Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled
data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures
such as $\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\%.
These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis
alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器人搭载2D LiDAR的方法，用于自动估计超声探头初始位置，以减少非专家任务的操作负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图操作依赖性强，且训练有素的技师资源有限，尤其在资源匮乏地区。现有远程机器人超声检查耗时较长，增加了诊断延迟和操作负担。

Method: 通过机器人搭载的2D LiDAR重建胸部3D表面，并与非刚性模板对齐，自动估计探头初始位置。

Result: 在人体试验中，初始点与临床定义点偏差20-30 mm，同一受试者重复试验的变异小于4 mm。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了机器人搭载2D LiDAR在人体表面3D重建中的首次应用，为减少超声检查操作负担提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Echocardiography is a key imaging modality for cardiac assessment but remains
highly operator-dependent, and access to trained sonographers is limited in
underserved settings. Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed
as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than
manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload.
Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal
starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and
depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to
lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D
LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates
the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a
human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the
transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an
overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty
below 0.2{\deg}. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR
sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose.
A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface
errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm. Human trials (N=5) evaluating the proposed approach
found probe initial points typically 20-30 mm from the clinically defined
initial point, while the variation across repeated trials on the same subject
was less than 4 mm.

Conclusion: 强化学习能为空中机器人提供动态交互任务中的鲁棒和稳定控制。

Abstract: Aerial robots interacting with objects must perform precise, contact-rich
maneuvers under uncertainty. In this paper, we study the problem of aerial ball
juggling using a quadrotor equipped with a racket, a task that demands accurate
timing, stable control, and continuous adaptation. We propose JuggleRL, the
first reinforcement learning-based system for aerial juggling. It learns
closed-loop policies in large-scale simulation using systematic calibration of
quadrotor and ball dynamics to reduce the sim-to-real gap. The training
incorporates reward shaping to encourage racket-centered hits and sustained
juggling, as well as domain randomization over ball position and coefficient of
restitution to enhance robustness and transferability. The learned policy
outputs mid-level commands executed by a low-level controller and is deployed
zero-shot on real hardware, where an enhanced perception module with a
lightweight communication protocol reduces delays in high-frequency state
estimation and ensures real-time control. Experiments show that JuggleRL
achieves an average of $311$ hits over $10$ consecutive trials in the real
world, with a maximum of $462$ hits observed, far exceeding a model-based
baseline that reaches at most $14$ hits with an average of $3.1$. Moreover, the
policy generalizes to unseen conditions, successfully juggling a lighter $5$ g
ball with an average of $145.9$ hits. This work demonstrates that reinforcement
learning can empower aerial robots with robust and stable control in dynamic
interaction tasks.

Abstract: Cooperative perception enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything communication has
shown great promise in enhancing situational awareness for autonomous vehicles

backbones and multi-agent fusion, real-world deployments remain challenged by
hard detection cases, exemplified by partial detections and noise accumulation
which limit downstream detection accuracy. This work presents Diffusion on
Reinforced Cooperative Perception (DRCP), a real-time deployable framework
designed to address aforementioned issues in dynamic driving environments. DRCP
integrates two key components: (1) Precise-Pyramid-Cross-Modality-Cross-Agent,
a cross-modal cooperative perception module that leverages
camera-intrinsic-aware angular partitioning for attention-based fusion and
adaptive convolution to better exploit external features; and (2)
Mask-Diffusion-Mask-Aggregation, a novel lightweight diffusion-based refinement
module that encourages robustness against feature perturbations and aligns
bird's-eye-view features closer to the task-optimal manifold. The proposed
system achieves real-time performance on mobile platforms while significantly
improving robustness under challenging conditions. Code will be released in

Abstract: {Recognizing human interactions is essential for social robots as it enables
them to navigate safely and naturally in shared environments. Conventional
robotic systems however often focus on obstacle avoidance, neglecting social
cues necessary for seamless human-robot interaction. To address this gap, we
propose a framework to recognize human group interactions for socially aware
navigation. Our method utilizes color and depth frames from a monocular RGB-D
camera to estimate 3D human keypoints and positions. Principal component
analysis (PCA) is then used to determine dominant interaction directions. The
shoelace formula is finally applied to compute interest points and engagement
areas. Extensive experiments have been conducted to evaluate the validity of
the proposed method. The results show that our method is capable of recognizing
group interactions across different scenarios with varying numbers of
individuals. It also achieves high-speed performance, processing each frame in
approximately 4 ms on a single-board computer used in robotic systems. The
method is implemented as a ROS 2 package making it simple to integrate into

Conclusion: 分层设计有效解决了复杂任务中的模仿学习问题，为机器人行为模仿提供了新思路。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic manipulation often suffers from limited
generalization and data scarcity, especially in complex, long-horizon tasks. In
this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating
vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies
to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to
treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as
sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when
exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM
to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then
grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot
behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain
real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a
memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this
design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when
compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level
planning and low-level control.

cinematography, and ethics. Built on model predictive control, CineWild
dynamically adjusts flight paths and camera settings to balance cinematic
quality with animal welfare. Key features include adaptive zoom for filming

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于非自适应和部分自适应方法，实时运行频率达270 Hz。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练或先验知识，适用于多种机器人系统。

Abstract: This work introduces an adaptive Bayesian algorithm for real-time trajectory
prediction via intention inference, where a target's intentions and motion
characteristics are unknown and subject to change. The method concurrently
estimates two critical variables: the target's current intention, modeled as a
Markovian latent state, and an intention parameter that describes the target's
adherence to a shortest-path policy. By integrating this joint update
technique, the algorithm maintains robustness against abrupt intention shifts
and unknown motion dynamics. A sampling-based trajectory prediction mechanism
then exploits these adaptive estimates to generate probabilistic forecasts with
quantified uncertainty. We validate the framework through numerical
experiments: Ablation studies of two cases, and a 500-trial Monte Carlo
analysis; Hardware demonstrations on quadrotor and quadrupedal platforms.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly
outperforms non-adaptive and partially adaptive methods. The method operates in
real time around 270 Hz without requiring training or detailed prior knowledge
of target behavior, showcasing its applicability in various robotic systems.

Motivation: VLA模型依赖大规模演示数据，在数据稀缺时性能下降，且RL后训练在真实环境中难以应用。

Method: World-Env框架包含视频世界模拟器和VLM引导的即时反射器，提供虚拟环境和连续奖励信号。

Result: 仅需少量专家演示即可显著提升性能，克服数据效率低、安全约束和执行效率问题。

Conclusion: World-Env为资源受限环境提供了一种实用且可扩展的VLA模型后训练解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models trained via imitation learning suffer
from significant performance degradation in data-scarce scenarios due to their
reliance on large-scale demonstration datasets. Although reinforcement learning
(RL)-based post-training has proven effective in addressing data scarcity, its
application to VLA models is hindered by the non-resettable nature of
real-world environments. This limitation is particularly critical in high-risk
domains such as industrial automation, where interactions often induce state
changes that are costly or infeasible to revert. Furthermore, existing VLA
approaches lack a reliable mechanism for detecting task completion, leading to
redundant actions that reduce overall task success rates. To address these
challenges, we propose World-Env, an RL-based post-training framework that
replaces physical interaction with a low-cost, world model-based virtual
simulator. World-Env consists of two key components: (1) a video-based world
simulator that generates temporally consistent future visual observations, and
(2) a vision-language model (VLM)-guided instant reflector that provides
continuous reward signals and predicts action termination. This simulated
environment enables VLA models to safely explore and generalize beyond their
initial imitation learning distribution. Our method achieves notable
performance gains with as few as five expert demonstrations per task.
Experiments on complex robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that World-Env
effectively overcomes the data inefficiency, safety constraints, and
inefficient execution of conventional VLA models that rely on real-world
interaction, offering a practical and scalable solution for post-training in
resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: MSG框架通过组合多个对象中心策略提升生成策略的样本效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生成式机器人策略样本效率低的问题。

Method: 提出多流生成策略（MSG），在推理时组合多个对象中心策略。

Result: 实验显示MSG仅需5次演示即可学习高质量策略，样本效率提升95%，性能提升89%。

Conclusion: MSG是一种广泛适用的高效策略组合框架，支持零样本实例迁移。

Abstract: Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal
policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies
improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work,
we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition
framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at
inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is
model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various
generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments
both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns
high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting
in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89
percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present
comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide
practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object
instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at
https://msg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有单次模仿学习方法在多步任务中的局限性。

Method: 基于单次演示的方法，无需额外训练或标注。

Result: 多步任务平均成功率82.5%，单步任务90%，优于基线。

Conclusion: 方法在多步和单步任务中均表现优异，计算效率高。

Abstract: Recent advances in one-shot imitation learning have enabled robots to acquire
new manipulation skills from a single human demonstration. While existing
methods achieve strong performance on single-step tasks, they remain limited in
their ability to handle long-horizon, multi-step tasks without additional model
training or manual annotation. We propose a method that can be applied to this
setting provided a single demonstration without additional model training or
manual annotation. We evaluated our method on multi-step and single-step
manipulation tasks where our method achieves an average success rate of 82.5%
and 90%, respectively. Our method matches and exceeds the performance of the
baselines in both these cases. We also compare the performance and
computational efficiency of alternative pre-trained feature extractors within
our framework.

TL;DR: Path Diffuser (PD) 是一种基于扩散模型的两阶段方法，用于生成无历史轨迹依赖的交通场景模拟，显著提升了多样性和道路合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则或学习的模拟器在生成新场景时缺乏多样性和真实性，且依赖历史数据。PD 旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PD 采用两阶段扩散模型，结合 Frenet 帧候选轨迹的运动基元先验，生成地图条件下的初始姿态和轨迹。

Result: 在 Argoverse2 数据集上，PD 在分布指标、常识指标和道路合规性上分别优于基线方法 1.92x、1.14x 和 1.62x。

Conclusion: PD 提供了一种高效、多样且真实的交通场景生成方法，适用于分布外地图场景。

Abstract: Simulating diverse and realistic traffic scenarios is critical for developing
and testing autonomous planning. Traditional rule-based planners lack diversity
and realism, while learning-based simulators often replay, forecast, or edit
scenarios using historical agent trajectories. However, they struggle to
generate new scenarios, limiting scalability and diversity due to their
reliance on fully annotated logs and historical data. Thus, a key challenge for
a learning-based simulator's performance is that it requires agents' past
trajectories and pose information in addition to map data, which might not be
available for all agents on the road.Without which, generated scenarios often
produce unrealistic trajectories that deviate from drivable areas, particularly
under out-of-distribution (OOD) map scenes (e.g., curved roads). To address
this, we propose Path Diffuser (PD): a two-stage, diffusion model for
generating agent pose initializations and their corresponding trajectories
conditioned on the map, free of any historical context of agents' trajectories.
Furthermore, PD incorporates a motion primitive-based prior, leveraging Frenet
frame candidate trajectories to enhance diversity while ensuring road-compliant
trajectory generation. We also explore various design choices for modeling
complex multi-agent interactions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method through extensive experiments on the Argoverse2 Dataset and additionally
evaluate the generalizability of the approach on OOD map variants. Notably,
Path Diffuser outperforms the baseline methods by 1.92x on distribution
metrics, 1.14x on common-sense metrics, and 1.62x on road compliance from
adversarial benchmarks.

Motivation: 机器人从受控环境转向非结构化人类环境时，需要能够可靠执行自然语言指令的通用智能体，但目前缺乏包含接触丰富和长时程任务的大规模多模态数据集。

Method: 通过收集25,469个任务片段（约94小时），使用Human Support Robot (HSR)采集同步的多模态数据，并采用两层注释模式（子目标和原始动作）支持分层学习和错误分析。

Result: 数据集标准化为LeRobot v2.1格式，为下一代视觉-语言-动作模型提供了关键基准。

Conclusion: AIRoA MoMa填补了现有数据集的空白，推动了移动操作和接触丰富交互的研究。

Abstract: As robots transition from controlled settings to unstructured human
environments, building generalist agents that can reliably follow natural
language instructions remains a central challenge. Progress in robust mobile
manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich
and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque
sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this
gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset
for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states,
six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a
novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for
hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469
episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is
fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile
manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa
provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of
Vision-Language-Action models. The first version of our dataset is now
available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/airoa-org/airoa-moma .

TL;DR: AgriCruiser是一款低成本、可快速适应多种作物和行布局的开源农业机器人，通过精准喷洒系统有效减少杂草并降低作物损伤。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发低成本、可重构的农业机器人，以解决杂草管理和减少作物损伤的需求，同时为农业应用提供多功能平台。

Method: 设计可调轨道宽度和高离地间隙的底盘，集成精准喷洒系统，并在多种地形上进行移动实验。

Result: 在12块亚麻地中，机器人喷洒比人工除草减少杂草24至42倍，且作物损伤更少；底盘成本约5000-6000美元。

Conclusion: 低成本、可重构的行间机器人能有效管理杂草，减少作物损伤和劳动力需求，为农业应用提供多功能基础。

Abstract: We present the AgriCruiser, an open-source over-the-row agricultural robot
developed for low-cost deployment and rapid adaptation across diverse crops and
row layouts. The chassis provides an adjustable track width of 1.42 m to 1.57
m, along with a ground clearance of 0.94 m. The AgriCruiser achieves compact
pivot turns with radii of 0.71 m to 0.79 m, enabling efficient headland
maneuvers. The platform is designed for the integration of the other
subsystems, and in this study, a precision spraying system was implemented to
assess its effectiveness in weed management. In twelve flax plots, a single
robotic spray pass reduced total weed populations (pigweed and Venice mallow)
by 24- to 42-fold compared to manual weeding in four flax plots, while also
causing less crop damage. Mobility experiments conducted on concrete, asphalt,
gravel, grass, and both wet and dry soil confirmed reliable traversal
consistent with torque sizing. The complete chassis can be constructed from
commodity T-slot extrusion with minimal machining, resulting in a bill of
materials costing approximately $5,000 - $6,000, which enables replication and
customization. The mentioned results demonstrate that low-cost, reconfigurable
over-the-row robots can achieve effective weed management with reduced crop
damage and labor requirements, while providing a versatile foundation for
phenotyping, sensing, and other agriculture applications. Design files and
implementation details are released to accelerate research and adoption of
modular agricultural robotics.

Motivation: 传统线性作物布局不利于机器人导航，存在转弯困难、路径长和感知混淆问题。

Method: 采用方形螺旋布局，结合DH-ResNet18、A*规划和MPC等导航技术。

Result: 螺旋布局路径缩短28%，任务执行快25%，多机器人协调效率提升33-37%。

Conclusion: 重新设计农田几何布局可显著提升自主农业效率。

Abstract: Conventional linear crop layouts, optimised for tractors, hinder robotic
navigation with tight turns, long travel distances, and perceptual aliasing. We
propose a robot-centric square spiral layout with a central tramline, enabling
simpler motion and more efficient coverage. To exploit this geometry, we
develop a navigation stack combining DH-ResNet18 waypoint regression,
pixel-to-odometry mapping, A* planning, and model predictive control (MPC). In
simulations, the spiral layout yields up to 28% shorter paths and about 25%
faster execution for waypoint-based tasks across 500 waypoints than linear
layouts, while full-field coverage performance is comparable to an optimised
linear U-turn strategy. Multi-robot studies demonstrate efficient coordination
on the spirals rule-constrained graph, with a greedy allocator achieving 33-37%
lower batch completion times than a Hungarian assignment under our setup. These
results highlight the potential of redesigning field geometry to better suit
autonomous agriculture.

Motivation: 多机器人系统的控制策略学习面临长期协调和训练数据不足的挑战。

Method: 1. 改进课程学习，逐步增加专家轨迹长度以提升长期协调；2. 提出一种方法，通过过滤邻居、转换参考帧和模拟传感器变异性，将全局演示转化为局部感知。

Result: 实验表明，课程学习提高了长期准确性，感知估计方法增强了策略对不确定性的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 结合这两种策略，可以从全局演示中学习到鲁棒的分布式控制器，无需专家动作或车载测量。

Abstract: Learning control policies for multi-robot systems (MRS) remains a major
challenge due to long-term coordination and the difficulty of obtaining
realistic training data. In this work, we address both limitations within an
imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum
Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on
improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that
gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training,
stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second,
we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot
using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms
idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering
neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor
variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed
technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We
conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels.
Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our
perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic
uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust,
distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of
expert actions or onboard measurements.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在任务完成率上优于基线方法，并验证了理论任务完成率。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了无需传感器模型或噪声知识的语义规划，显著提高了任务成功率。

Abstract: This paper addresses semantic planning problems in unknown environments under
perceptual uncertainty. The environment contains multiple unknown semantically
labeled regions or objects, and the robot must reach desired locations while
maintaining class-dependent distances from them. We aim to compute robot paths
that complete such semantic reach-avoid tasks with user-defined probability
despite uncertain perception. Existing planning algorithms either ignore
perceptual uncertainty - thus lacking correctness guarantees - or assume known
sensor models and noise characteristics. In contrast, we present the first
planner for semantic reach-avoid tasks that achieves user-specified mission
completion rates without requiring any knowledge of sensor models or noise.
This is enabled by quantifying uncertainty in semantic maps - constructed
on-the-fly from perceptual measurements - using conformal prediction in a
model- and distribution-free manner. We validate our approach and the
theoretical mission completion rates through extensive experiments, showing
that it consistently outperforms baselines in mission success rates.

Motivation: 探索局部对抗性噪声的潜力，填补传统全局对抗性攻击研究的不足。

Method: 通过引入二进制掩码限制噪声区域，系统评估了FGSM、PGD和C&W等方法的局部攻击效果。

Result: 局部攻击在像素扰动、PSNR和SSIM上优于全局攻击，但计算成本增加且攻击成功率略有下降。

Conclusion: 迭代方法（如PGD和C&W）在局部约束下表现更稳健，为攻击策略和防御系统设计提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks in machine learning traditionally focus on global
perturbations to input data, yet the potential of localized adversarial noise
remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates localized
adversarial attacks across widely-used methods, including FGSM, PGD, and C&W,
to quantify their effectiveness, imperceptibility, and computational
efficiency. By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific
regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel
perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved
Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these
benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest
reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative
methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than
single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility
metrics. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of localized adversarial
attacks, offering practical insights for advancing attack strategies and
designing robust defensive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ICL在多任务顺序到达时是否能实现长期保留和跨任务知识积累，受人类记忆研究启发。

Method: 通过任务调度和提示重排扩展ICL为ICCL，并在Markov-Chain基准上实验，分析分布式练习（DP）的效果。

Result: 实验表明ICCL在特定LLMs中受益于DP，表现出类似人类的保留特性；线性注意力模型（如MAMBA和RWKV）保留模式更接近人类。

Conclusion: ICCL在认知上合理且实用，提供了一种仅推理的持续学习范式，解决了传统CL方法的稳定性-可塑性困境。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can adapt to new tasks via in-context learning
(ICL) without parameter updates, making them powerful learning engines for fast
adaptation. While extensive research has examined ICL as a few-shot learner,
whether it can achieve long-term retention and cross-task knowledge
accumulation when multitasks arrive sequentially remains underexplored.
Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics
of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning
(ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and
prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that,
for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice
(DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing "sweet
spot" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention
similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method
aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that
linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like
retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of
Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively
plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm
that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity
dilemma in conventional CL methods.

Abstract: Collaborative learning across heterogeneous model architectures presents
significant challenges in ensuring interoperability and preserving privacy. We
propose a communication-efficient distributed learning framework that supports
model heterogeneity and enables modular composition during inference. To
facilitate interoperability, all clients adopt a common fusion-layer output
dimension, which permits each model to be partitioned into a personalized base
block and a generalized modular block. Clients share their fusion-layer
outputs, keeping model parameters and architectures private. Experimental
results demonstrate that the framework achieves superior communication
efficiency compared to federated learning (FL) and federated split learning
(FSL) baselines, while ensuring stable training performance across
heterogeneous architectures.

Motivation: 缺乏对自注意力层容量的形式化理解，即在一定预算下能恢复多少种不同的关系。

Method: 引入关系图识别（RGR）框架，通过总键维度$D_K$衡量资源，推导容量缩放定律，并进行实验验证。

Result: 证明了$D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$是恢复$m'$关系的必要和充分条件，并展示了多头部注意力的优势。

Conclusion: 研究提供了自注意力容量的具体缩放定律，并为键-查询预算分配提供了设计原则。

Abstract: While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a
formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single
layer reliably recover for a given budget?
  To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the
key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges,
and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We
measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\,d_k$. Within this
framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it
empirically. We show that $D_K = \Theta(m' \log m' / d_{\text{model}})$ is both
necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit
construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This
scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head
attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target.
When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\text{model}}$) and the graph is a
permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m >
d_{\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating
interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows
that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this
interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled
single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance
threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit
of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads.
  Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention
capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across
heads.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness in structured data remains an underexplored frontier
compared to vision and language domains. In this work, we introduce a novel
black-box, decision-based adversarial attack tailored for tabular data. Our
approach combines gradient-free direction estimation with an iterative boundary
search, enabling efficient navigation of discrete and continuous feature spaces
under minimal oracle access. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
successfully compromises nearly the entire test set across diverse models,
ranging from classical machine learning classifiers to large language model
(LLM)-based pipelines. Remarkably, the attack achieves success rates
consistently above 90%, while requiring only a small number of queries per
instance. These results highlight the critical vulnerability of tabular models
to adversarial perturbations, underscoring the urgent need for stronger
defenses in real-world decision-making systems.

Motivation: 现有方法在RLHF中使用的边距固定或简单，无法反映偏好强度的差异，且依赖噪声评分。通过建模偏好强度可提升性能。

Method: 利用偏好间的比较信号（偏好对偏好的标注）推断自适应边距，扩展DPO为DPO-PoP。

Result: 在UltraFeedback数据集上，DPO-PoP优于固定边距和真实边距的DPO，但存在判别性与生成性能的权衡。

Conclusion: 通过两种采样策略平衡判别性与生成性能，DPO-PoP为RLHF提供了更灵活的优化框架。

Abstract: Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and
robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning
from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF),
existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that
are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations
often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for
example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses,
or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that
modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more
faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive
margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for
humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences
over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences
reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive
margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from
preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and
generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO
with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback
dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative
and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy,
particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of
stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this
tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather
preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and
one favoring generative performance.

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了OLTR算法的安全漏洞，为未来防御策略的设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) plays a critical role in information retrieval
and machine learning systems, with a wide range of applications in search
engines and content recommenders. However, despite their extensive adoption,
the susceptibility of OLTR algorithms to coordinated adversarial attacks
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present a novel framework for
attacking some of the widely used OLTR algorithms. Our framework is designed to
promote a set of target items so that they appear in the list of top-K
recommendations for T - o(T) rounds, while simultaneously inducing linear
regret in the learning algorithm. We propose two novel attack strategies:
CascadeOFA for CascadeUCB1 and PBMOFA for PBM-UCB . We provide theoretical
guarantees showing that both strategies require only O(log T) manipulations to
succeed. Additionally, we supplement our theoretical analysis with empirical
results on real-world data.

TL;DR: 论文研究了图神经网络中邻域采样的系统性行为，通过神经正切核工具分析了不同采样方法的后验高斯过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 邻域采样在大规模图神经网络训练中至关重要，但其系统性行为尚不明确，需要理论分析。

Method: 使用神经正切核工具，分析不同邻域采样方法及其对应的后验高斯过程。

Result: 有限样本下，不同采样方法的后验不同，但随着样本增加会收敛；后验协方差不可比较，与观察到的无采样方法占优一致。

Conclusion: 邻域采样的后验行为在有限样本下存在差异，且无单一采样方法在所有情况下最优。

Abstract: Neighborhood sampling is an important ingredient in the training of
large-scale graph neural networks. It suppresses the exponential growth of the
neighborhood size across network layers and maintains feasible memory
consumption and time costs. While it becomes a standard implementation in
practice, its systemic behaviors are less understood. We conduct a theoretical
analysis by using the tool of neural tangent kernels, which characterize the
(analogous) training dynamics of neural networks based on their infinitely wide
counterparts -- Gaussian processes (GPs). We study several established
neighborhood sampling approaches and the corresponding posterior GP. With
limited samples, the posteriors are all different, although they converge to
the same one as the sample size increases. Moreover, the posterior covariance,
which lower-bounds the mean squared prediction error, is uncomparable, aligning
with observations that no sampling approach dominates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水电站的非计划停机成本高且难以维护，现有声学异常检测研究多依赖通用数据集，缺乏针对水电站的研究。

Method: 在强噪声条件下进行声学预处理，提取时频域特征，并比较LSTM AE、K-Means和OC-SVM三种模型。

Result: OC-SVM在准确率（ROC AUC 0.966-0.998）和训练时间上表现最佳，LSTM AE检测能力强但计算成本高。

Conclusion: OC-SVM是水电站声学异常检测的最佳选择，兼顾准确性和效率。

Abstract: In the context of industrial factories and energy producers, unplanned
outages are highly costly and difficult to service. However, existing
acoustic-anomaly detection studies largely rely on generic industrial or
synthetic datasets, with few focused on hydropower plants due to limited
access. This paper presents a comparative analysis of acoustic-based anomaly
detection methods, as a way to improve predictive maintenance in hydropower
plants. We address key challenges in the acoustic preprocessing under highly
noisy conditions before extracting time- and frequency-domain features. Then,
we benchmark three machine learning models: LSTM AE, K-Means, and OC-SVM, which
are tested on two real-world datasets from the Rodundwerk II pumped-storage
plant in Austria, one with induced anomalies and one with real-world
conditions. The One-Class SVM achieved the best trade-off of accuracy (ROC AUC
0.966-0.998) and minimal training time, while the LSTM autoencoder delivered
strong detection (ROC AUC 0.889-0.997) at the expense of higher computational
cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准Conformal Prediction（CP）对敏感属性不敏感，已有研究尝试将公平性纳入CP，但尚未在联邦学习环境中实现。

Method: 扩展CF框架至联邦学习，利用可交换性假设，通过实验验证框架的有效性。

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上实证验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 成功将CF应用于联邦学习，为公平性审计提供了新方法。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a widely used technique for quantifying
uncertainty in machine learning models. In its standard form, CP offers
probabilistic guarantees on the coverage of the true label, but it is agnostic
to sensitive attributes in the dataset. Several recent works have sought to
incorporate fairness into CP by ensuring conditional coverage guarantees across
different subgroups. One such method is Conformal Fairness (CF). In this work,
we extend the CF framework to the Federated Learning setting and discuss how we
can audit a federated model for fairness by analyzing the fairness-related gaps
for different demographic groups. We empirically validate our framework by
conducting experiments on several datasets spanning multiple domains, fully
leveraging the exchangeability assumption.

Abstract: Manifold alignment (MA) involves a set of techniques for learning shared
representations across domains, yet many traditional MA methods are incapable
of performing out-of-sample extension, limiting their real-world applicability.
We propose a guided representation learning framework leveraging a
geometry-regularized twin autoencoder (AE) architecture to enhance MA while
enabling generalization to unseen data. Our method enforces structured
cross-modal mappings to maintain geometric fidelity in learned embeddings. By
incorporating a pre-trained alignment model and a multitask learning
formulation, we improve cross-domain generalization and representation
robustness while maintaining alignment fidelity. We evaluate our approach using
several MA methods, showing improvements in embedding consistency, information
preservation, and cross-domain transfer. Additionally, we apply our framework
to Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, demonstrating its ability to integrate
multi-modal patient data and enhance predictive accuracy in cases limited to a
single domain by leveraging insights from the multi-modal problem.

Conclusion: 提供了一种理论可靠且高效的奖励感知蒸馏框架。

Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to large language model (LLM) distillation by
formulating it as a constrained reinforcement learning problem. While recent
work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into
distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward
weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes
task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model
to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state
augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a
modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint
satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access
during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian
methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we
demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and
better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while
maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a
theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware
distillation in resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: MonoCon通过功能约束学习高质量、鲁棒、高效的解耦表示，显著提升了嵌入的紧凑性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI中学习高质量、鲁棒、高效和解耦表示的核心挑战。

Method: 使用带有单调性约束的小型MLP头，结合对比损失和预训练编码器。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和SNLI任务中，分别实现了9倍和3.4倍的嵌入紧凑性提升，同时保持高分类准确率。

Conclusion: MonoCon为边缘计算到云端检索等场景提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning high-quality, robust, efficient, and disentangled representations is
a central challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Deep metric learning
frameworks tackle this challenge primarily using architectural and optimization
constraints. Here, we introduce a third approach that instead relies on
$\textit{functional}$ constraints. Specifically, we present MonoCon, a simple
framework that uses a small monotonic multi-layer perceptron (MLP) head
attached to any pre-trained encoder. Due to co-adaptation between encoder and
head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns
robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible
performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields
representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the
fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\% of the baseline's 5-NN
classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more
robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal
reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic
framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via
functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in
disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索QAT与FP训练的最优计算分配，以提高量化模型的准确性。

Method: 通过实验分析不同计算预算、QAT位宽和模型大小的影响，并提出预测方法和融合策略。

Result: 发现最优QAT比例可预测，且融合策略能显著节省计算资源。

Conclusion: 研究结果为高效QAT规划提供了实用指导，提升了量化模型的质量。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is a leading technique for improving the
accuracy of quantized neural networks. Previous work has shown that decomposing
training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields
superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of
compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive
experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from
86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final
performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the
loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of
compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide
range of model sizes and quantization widths using the
tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss
scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance
across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We
use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify
experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory
constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to
full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and
QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with
quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates
and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical
insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality
quantized models with the same compute budget.

Result: SOAP与Shampoo的收敛速度相似，最终损失无显著差异，验证了理论等价性。

Conclusion: SOAP在实践中的优势可能源于其实现细节而非理论差异，与Shampoo在理想条件下等价。

Abstract: Shampoo with Adam in the Preconditioner's eigenbasis (SOAP) has recently
emerged as a promising optimization algorithm for neural network training,
achieving superior training efficiency over both Adam and Shampoo in language
modeling tasks. In this work, we analyze Adam, Shampoo, and SOAP from the
perspective of gradient whitening, interpreting their preconditioners as
approximations to the whitening matrix, which captures second-order curvature
information. We further establish a theoretical equivalence between idealized
versions of SOAP and Shampoo under the Kronecker product assumption. To
empirically evaluate these insights, we reproduce the language modeling
experiments using nanoGPT and grayscale image colorization. Our results show
that SOAP exhibits similar convergence rate as Shampoo, and no significant
advantage over both Adam and Shampoo in the final loss achieved, which aligns
with their equivalence in theory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前后训练量化方法在4比特及以下时会出现困惑度下降问题，主要由于异常值导致的参数精度问题。

Method: SINQ通过第二轴尺度因子和Sinkhorn-Knopp算法，归一化行和列的方差，最小化矩阵不平衡。

Result: 在Qwen3和DeepSeek-V2.5模型上，SINQ显著提升了WikiText2和C4的困惑度。

Conclusion: SINQ是一种高效且通用的后训练量化方法，适用于各种线性层，并可与其他量化技术结合进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization has emerged as the most widely used strategy for
deploying large language models at low precision. Still, current methods show
perplexity degradation at bit-widths less than or equal to 4, partly because
representing outliers causes precision issues in parameters that share the same
scales as these outliers. This problem is especially pronounced for
calibration-free, uniform quantization methods. We introduce SINQ to augment
existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor
and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize
per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy
target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions
between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize
any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and
DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against
uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by
combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels. Code to
reproduce the results of this work and to easily quantize models using SINQ is
available at https://github.com/huawei-csl/SINQ.

Motivation: 变分DA方法在计算Hessian信息时计算成本高，需要一种更高效的方法来优化初始条件。

Method: 使用Fourier Neural Operator (FNO)近似逆Hessian算子，并结合共轭梯度法 (CG) 进行初始化。

Result: 在平流方程实验中，FNO-CG方法平均相对误差降低62%，迭代次数减少17%。

Conclusion: FNO-CG在病态条件下表现尤为突出，为复杂DA问题提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for enhancing solutions to partial
differential equations (PDEs), such as those in numerical weather prediction,
by optimizing initial conditions using observational data. Variational DA
methods are widely used in oceanic and atmospheric forecasting, but become
computationally expensive, especially when Hessian information is involved. To
address this challenge, we propose a meta-learning framework that employs the
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to approximate the inverse Hessian operator
across a family of DA problems, thereby providing an effective initialization
for the conjugate gradient (CG) method. Numerical experiments on a linear
advection equation demonstrate that the resulting FNO-CG approach reduces the
average relative error by $62\%$ and the number of iterations by $17\%$
compared to the standard CG. These improvements are most pronounced in
ill-conditioned scenarios, highlighting the robustness and efficiency of FNO-CG
for challenging DA problems.

Conclusion: GDR-learners是一种灵活且高效的方法，适用于多种深度生成模型，显著提升了潜在结果条件分布的估计效果。

Abstract: Various deep generative models have been proposed to estimate potential
outcomes distributions from observational data. However, none of them have the
favorable theoretical property of general Neyman-orthogonality and, associated
with it, quasi-oracle efficiency and double robustness. In this paper, we
introduce a general suite of generative Neyman-orthogonal (doubly-robust)
learners that estimate the conditional distributions of potential outcomes. Our
proposed GDR-learners are flexible and can be instantiated with many
state-of-the-art deep generative models. In particular, we develop GDR-learners
based on (a) conditional normalizing flows (which we call GDR-CNFs), (b)
conditional generative adversarial networks (GDR-CGANs), (c) conditional
variational autoencoders (GDR-CVAEs), and (d) conditional diffusion models
(GDR-CDMs). Unlike the existing methods, our GDR-learners possess the
properties of quasi-oracle efficiency and rate double robustness, and are thus
asymptotically optimal. In a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we
demonstrate that our GDR-learners are very effective and outperform the
existing methods in estimating the conditional distributions of potential
outcomes.

Conclusion: 为结合不完美的角色评分和有偏人类评分提供了理论基础，以获得有效的系统质量估计。

Abstract: As Generative AI (GenAI) systems see growing adoption, a key concern involves
the external validity of evaluations, or the extent to which they generalize
from lab-based to real-world deployment conditions. Threats to the external
validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and
system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target
distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust
estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to
our approach is the use of "persona" ratings produced by prompting an LLM
evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific
sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these
informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under
evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality
estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality
estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using
persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a
reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We
validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation
Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the
degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data. Our work provides a
principled foundation for combining imperfect persona ratings with human
ratings observed under sampling bias to obtain valid system quality estimates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) struggles to scale to large, combinatorial action
spaces common in many real-world problems. This paper introduces a novel
framework for training discrete diffusion models as highly effective policies
in these complex settings. Our key innovation is an efficient online training
process that ensures stable and effective policy improvement. By leveraging
policy mirror descent (PMD) to define an ideal, regularized target policy
distribution, we frame the policy update as a distributional matching problem,
training the expressive diffusion model to replicate this stable target. This
decoupled approach stabilizes learning and significantly enhances training
performance. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results and superior sample
efficiency across a diverse set of challenging combinatorial benchmarks,
including DNA sequence generation, RL with macro-actions, and multi-agent
systems. Experiments demonstrate that our diffusion policies attain superior
performance compared to other baselines.

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) with function approximation offers an
effective way to improve sample efficiency by reusing past experience. Within
this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical
success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the
off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic "deadly triad"
instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a "moving target"
problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor
learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact
off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem
to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the
second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and
often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is
typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy
gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of
functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses
both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We
provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the
provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical
perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network
architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its
effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the
DeepMind Control Benchmark.

universal-approximator encoder that captures complex nonlinear
interdependencies among component functions, and a universal-approximator
decoder capable of accurately reconstructing both Euclidean and manifold-valued
functional data. Stability and robustness are enhanced through innovative
regularization strategies applied to functional weights and biases.
Additionally, we incorporate a clustering loss into the network's training
objective, promoting the learning of latent representations that are conducive
to effective clustering. A key innovation is our shape-informed clustering
objective, ensuring that the clustering results are resistant to phase
variations in the functions. We establish the universal approximation property

Abstract: Mathematical programming -- the task of expressing operations and
decision-making problems in precise mathematical language -- is fundamental
across domains, yet remains a skill-intensive process requiring operations
research expertise. Recent advances in large language models for complex
reasoning have spurred interest in automating this task, translating natural
language into executable optimization models. Current approaches, however,
achieve limited accuracy, hindered by scarce and noisy training data without
leveraging domain knowledge. In this work, we systematically integrate
optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear
programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans
training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common
mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference
strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver
feedback, enabling iterative refinement. Experiments across multiple base LLMs
demonstrate that combining cleaned data with domain-informed prompting and
feedback improves formulation accuracy by 14 percentage points on average,
enabling further progress toward robust LLM-assisted optimization formulation.

Abstract: We study a class of multi-stage stochastic programs, which incorporate
modeling features from Markov decision processes (MDPs). This class includes
structured MDPs with continuous state and action spaces. We extend policy
graphs to include decision-dependent uncertainty for one-step transition
probabilities as well as a limited form of statistical learning. We focus on
the expressiveness of our modeling approach, illustrating ideas with a series
of examples of increasing complexity. As a solution method, we develop new
variants of stochastic dual dynamic programming, including approximations to
handle non-convexities.

TL;DR: T-Tamer框架通过多阶段决策过程解决多模型服务中的效率与准确性权衡问题，证明基于回忆的策略能实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习模型规模和复杂度的增加，多模型服务中的效率与准确性权衡问题日益突出，现有方法缺乏理论保证和普适性。

Method: 提出T-Tamer框架，将问题形式化为多阶段决策过程，重点研究何时退出和选择哪个模型。

Result: 证明基于回忆的策略是必要的且能实现最优性能，实验验证其在准确性和延迟上的高效权衡。

Conclusion: T-Tamer为早期退出和级联模型的设计提供了理论支持，填补了启发式实践与理论保证之间的空白。

Abstract: As machine learning models continue to grow in size and complexity, efficient
serving faces increasingly broad trade-offs spanning accuracy, latency,
resource usage, and other objectives. Multi-model serving further complicates
these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision
balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the
pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain
largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees
and general applicability.
  We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a
multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to
exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the
ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for
achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that
strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to
the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the
optimal trade-off in polynomial time.
  We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and
early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that
recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency
trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging
heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and
cascaded models.

Motivation: 研究变分方法是否能提升稀疏自编码器的特征组织和可解释性。

Method: 提出vSAE，用高斯后验的随机采样替代确定性ReLU门控，并加入KL散度正则化。

Result: vSAE在核心指标上表现较差，特征独立性较强但无效特征较多。

Conclusion: 变分方法在稀疏自编码器中的简单应用未能提升性能或可解释性。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising approach for
interpreting neural network representations by learning sparse,
human-interpretable features from dense activations. We investigate whether
incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature
organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse
Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic
sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence
regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this
probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to
organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We
evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer
residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench,
individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space
visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core
evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics.
The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that
substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed
performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness,
they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that
naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature
organization or interpretability.

Conclusion: 新校准误差定义和算法在多类预测器校准中有效，改进了样本复杂度和误差依赖。

Abstract: Calibrating a multiclass predictor, that outputs a distribution over labels,
is particularly challenging due to the exponential number of possible
prediction values. In this work, we propose a new definition of calibration
error that interpolates between two established calibration error notions, one
with known exponential sample complexity and one with polynomial sample
complexity for calibrating a given predictor. Our algorithm can calibrate any
given predictor for the entire range of interpolation, except for one endpoint,
using only a polynomial number of samples. At the other endpoint, we achieve
nearly optimal dependence on the error parameter, improving upon previous work.
A key technical contribution is a novel application of adaptive data analysis
with high adaptivity but only logarithmic overhead in the sample complexity.

Abstract: From metronomes to celestial bodies, mechanics underpins how the world
evolves in time and space. With consideration of this, a number of recent
neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to
encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical.
However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a
single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of
a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space
GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and
generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not
require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can
discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary
measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve
physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds
a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To
discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional
time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to
encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate
the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry
discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on
par with supervised models designed for single systems.

TL;DR: MoE-PHDS是一种轻量级微调方法，通过单一检查点实现全局稀疏性控制，无需架构更改即可在推理时动态调整稀疏度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统稀疏混合专家模型（MoEs）通常需要训练多个模型以满足不同效率目标，增加了训练和维护成本。

Method: MoE-PHDS通过跨稀疏度混合训练和短课程学习，将单一检查点转化为全局稀疏性控制表面。

Result: 实验表明，MoE-PHDS在多个稀疏度下表现优于或匹配专用模型，并提升跨稀疏度一致性达22%。

Conclusion: MoE-PHDS简化了MoE模型的部署，使全局稀疏性成为推理时的灵活控制参数。

Abstract: Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed
sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity
level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently,
meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple
models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance
costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and
energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime
sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\bf P}ost {\bf
H}oc {\bf D}eclared {\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a
single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training
across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity,
requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency
tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time
without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level
heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary
models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds
well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\%
vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE
deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.

Result: 论文提出了针对高维设置的新理论和实践方法，并通过实例展示了层理论在拓扑深度学习中的应用。

Conclusion: 层理论为高维消息传递提供了更灵活和表达力强的框架，弥补了Hodge Laplacian的不足。

Abstract: Recent work in Topological Deep Learning (TDL) seeks to generalize graph
learning's preeminent $message \ passing$ paradigm to more complex relational
structures: simplicial complexes, cell complexes, hypergraphs, and combinations
thereof. Many approaches to such ${higher\text{-}order \ message \ passing}$
(HOMP) admit formulation in terms of nonlinear diffusion with the Hodge
(combinatorial) Laplacian, a graded operator which carries an inductive bias
that dimension-$k$ data features correlate with dimension-$k$ topological
features encoded in the (singular) cohomology of the underlying domain. For
$k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In
higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and
potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a
natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's
diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more
expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates
dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware
generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend
prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light --
and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel
theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied
by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the
applied.

Motivation: 标准训练指标无法解释大语言模型复杂能力的涌现，因此研究训练过程中表示几何的变化。

Method: 使用OLMo和Pythia模型，通过有效秩（RankMe）和特征谱衰减（α-ReQ）分析表示几何。

Result: 发现训练过程中存在三个几何相变阶段，且后训练方法（如SFT、DPO、RLVR）会进一步改变表示几何。

Conclusion: 几何相变揭示了模型能力涌现的机制，并为优化训练方法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Standard training metrics like loss fail to explain the emergence of complex
capabilities in large language models. We take a spectral approach to
investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and
post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay
($\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a
consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during
autoregressive pretraining. The initial "warmup" phase exhibits rapid
representational collapse. This is followed by an "entropy-seeking" phase,
where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak
n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a "compression-seeking" phase imposes
anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant
eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant
improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge
from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token
frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \ll |V|$). Post-training
further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive "entropy-seeking" dynamics to
integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving
in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness.
Conversely, RLVR induces "compression-seeking", enhancing reward alignment but
reducing generation diversity.

Abstract: Catastrophic interference, also known as catastrophic forgetting, is a
fundamental challenge in machine learning, where a trained learning model
progressively loses performance on previously learned tasks when adapting to
new ones. In this paper, we aim to better understand and model the catastrophic
interference problem from a latent representation learning point of view, and
propose a novel theoretical framework that formulates catastrophic interference
as an identification problem. Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting
phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA)
and all-task aware (ATA) setups. Building upon recent advances in
identifiability theory, we prove that this distance can be minimized through
identification of shared latent variables between these setups. When learning,
we propose our method \ourmeos with two-stage training strategy: First, we
employ maximum likelihood estimation to learn the latent representations from
both PTA and ATA configurations. Subsequently, we optimize the KL divergence to
identify and learn the shared latent variables. Through theoretical guarantee
and empirical validations, we establish that identifying and learning these
shared representations can effectively mitigate catastrophic interference in
machine learning systems. Our approach provides both theoretical guarantees and
practical performance improvements across both synthetic and benchmark
datasets.

Abstract: The Sixth-Generation (6G) network envisions pervasive artificial intelligence
(AI) as a core goal, enabled by edge intelligence through on-device data
utilization. To realize this vision, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a
key paradigm for collaborative training across edge devices. However, the
sensitivity and heterogeneity of edge data pose key challenges to FL: parameter
sharing risks data reconstruction, and a unified global model struggles to
adapt to diverse local distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel
federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy
(DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage
sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP
strategy to resist reconstruction attacks. To ensure distribution-aware
adaptation under privacy constraints, we develop a privacy-aware neural
architecture search (NAS) algorithm that generates locally customized
architectures and hyperparameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with
theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy
guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
methods in model performance. Experiments on benchmark datasets such as
CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that our scheme improves accuracy by 6.82\%
over the federated NAS method PerFedRLNAS, while reducing model size to 1/10
and communication cost to 1/20.

TL;DR: GuardNet是一个分层过滤框架，用于检测和过滤LLM中的越狱提示，显著提升了防御效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM易受越狱攻击，导致输出不安全、不可靠，亟需有效的防御方法。

Method: GuardNet通过构建结构化图结合图神经网络，在提示和标记两个层次上过滤越狱行为。

Result: 实验显示GuardNet在多个数据集上显著优于现有防御方法，F1分数大幅提升。

Conclusion: GuardNet是一种实用且鲁棒的防御方法，适用于实际LLM部署。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly susceptible to jailbreak
attacks, which are adversarial prompts that bypass alignment constraints and
induce unauthorized or harmful behaviors. These vulnerabilities undermine the
safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks
in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we
propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters
jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs
that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived
token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns
indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two
levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and
(ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans.
Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show
that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level
F$_1$ scores from 66.4\% to 99.8\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\% to over 94\%
on PLeak datasets. At the token level, GuardNet improves F$_1$ from 48-75\% to
74-91\%, with IoU gains up to +28\%. Despite its structural complexity,
GuardNet maintains acceptable latency and generalizes well in cross-domain
evaluations, making it a practical and robust defense against jailbreak threats
in real-world LLM deployments.

Motivation: 传统MCMC方法在临界点和复杂景观中混合速度慢，需要更高效的全局采样方法。

Method: 使用Transformer训练生成平衡样本，作为PT中的全局提议，结合Metropolis步骤。

Result: 在2D Ising模型和3D自旋玻璃中，IsingFormer显著减少平衡时间并找到更低能量状态。

Conclusion: IsingFormer展示了神经网络提案在加速MCMC和优化中的潜力，能够推广到未见问题实例。

Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) underlies both statistical physics and
combinatorial optimization, but mixes slowly near critical points and in rough
landscapes. Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across
temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its
configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium
samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the
target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for
global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual
single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces
magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures,
including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces
equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses
(optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy
states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes.
Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems,
IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to
unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution.
Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize
across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move
beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer
demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by
neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and
stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.

Conclusion: 为构建更智能、资源高效的联邦系统开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is increasingly adopted in domains like healthcare,
where data privacy is paramount. A fundamental challenge in these systems is
statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly
across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient
demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates
from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains
under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a
central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the
hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to
propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the
allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the
network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework
that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on
each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query.
Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark
datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of
client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new
direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated
systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug. Code is

Result: 在54个模型-数据集组合中验证了VIP的普遍存在，TVI能可靠预测语言先验强度。

Conclusion: 研究为诊断和理解LVLMs中的语言先验提供了系统工具。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal
tasks, yet they often default to their language prior (LP) -- memorized textual
patterns from pre-training while under-utilizing visual evidence. Prior
analyses of LP mostly rely on input-output probing, which fails to reveal the
internal mechanisms governing when and how vision influences model behavior. To
address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior
through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise
representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal
phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical
layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden
representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we
introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates
representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query
influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9
contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently
emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This
offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in
LVLMs.

functions or react only to short-term training signals. None of them are
supported by a comprehensive temporal view of how well neural networks actually
train. We present a new learning rate scheduler that models the training
performance of neural networks as a dynamical system. It leverages training
runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the
training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future
learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our
scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates
specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions.
It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as
well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models
are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better
generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is
computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top
of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be
made available after acceptance.

*Wanjin Feng,Yuan Yuan,Jingtao Ding,Yong Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于频谱一致性的预测性诊断框架，包括SCP和LUR两个工具，用于量化时间序列预测任务的固有难度和模型利用线性信息的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标混淆了模型性能与数据内在不可预测性，导致不公平的模型比较。

Method: 引入SCP（计算高效）和LUR（频率解析工具）来量化预测难度和模型效率。

Result: 揭示了‘预测性漂移’现象，并发现复杂模型在低预测性数据上表现更好，线性模型在高预测性任务中更有效。

Conclusion: 呼吁转向更细致的预测性感知评估，以促进公平比较和深入理解模型行为。

Abstract: In the era of increasingly complex AI models for time series forecasting,
progress is often measured by marginal improvements on benchmark leaderboards.
However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation
metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic
unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel,
predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our
framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence
Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\log N)$) and
task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given
forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a
frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a
model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We
validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core
insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of "predictability
drift", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over
time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex
models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are
highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift,
moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful,
predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a
deeper understanding of model behavior.

TL;DR: CLAD-Net 是一个用于可穿戴传感器数据持续学习的框架，结合自监督Transformer和CNN，解决了分布偏移和灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中传感器数据分布常发生变化（如不同用户数据差异），且持续学习时易出现灾难性遗忘，现有方法难以应对。

Method: CLAD-Net 整合自监督Transformer（作为长期记忆）和CNN（通过知识蒸馏训练），前者无标签学习全局活动模式，后者保留旧任务知识。

Result: 在PAMAP2数据集上达到91.36%准确率，仅8.78%遗忘率；半监督场景（10-20%标签数据）仍表现强劲。

Conclusion: CLAD-Net 有效解决了持续学习中的分布偏移和遗忘问题，对标签稀缺具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring
using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While
deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions
- an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor
data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to
distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence
of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from
catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are
learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of
labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net
(Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling
wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing
performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer,
acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The
transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across
body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels.
Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge
during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent
final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and
regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight
Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled
data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to
label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.

*Hyunwoo Lee,Hayoung Choi,Hyunju Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对特定奇Sigmoid函数类的初始化方法，解决了激活函数与权重初始化相互依赖的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 激活函数和权重初始化的不当组合会导致梯度消失、方差崩溃和学习率敏感性问题，因此需要一种针对特定激活函数的初始化方法。

Method: 定义了一个奇Sigmoid函数类，并为该类中的任何激活函数f提出了一种初始化方法，通过选择噪声尺度来避免激活值崩溃或饱和。

Result: 该方法在不使用归一化层的情况下可靠训练，表现出较强的数据效率，并能支持标准初始化方法无法收敛的激活函数。

Conclusion: 提出的初始化方法解决了激活函数与权重初始化的依赖问题，提升了训练的可靠性和数据效率。

Abstract: Activation functions critically influence trainability and expressivity, and
recent work has therefore explored a broad range of nonlinearities. However,
activations and weight initialization are interdependent: without an
appropriate initialization method, nonlinearities can cause saturation,
variance collapse, and increased learning rate sensitivity. We address this by
defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this
class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a
noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up
to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation.
Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers,
exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under
which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not
converge reliably.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流策略在离线强化学习中表现出色，但其潜力常受限于评论家仅学习单一标量回报估计。

Method: 引入DFC，利用流匹配技术建模回报的完整分布，提供更丰富的学习信号。

Result: 在D4RL和OGBench基准测试中表现优异，尤其在多模态动作分布任务中。

Conclusion: DFC通过分布化贝尔曼目标提升了流策略的性能，适用于离线和离线到在线微调场景。

Abstract: Flow-based policies have recently emerged as a powerful tool in offline and
offline-to-online reinforcement learning, capable of modeling the complex,
multimodal behaviors found in pre-collected datasets. However, the full
potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics,
which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To
address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a
novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return
distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow
matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible
transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target
distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based
policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable
and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance,
especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in
both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.

Method: 采用三部分评估方法：嵌入几何分析、度量对齐评估和因果敏感性测试，评估了四种最先进的NFMs在五个不同网络数据集上的表现。

Result: 发现所有模型均表现出显著的各向异性、不一致的特征敏感性模式，以及无法分离高级上下文和负载依赖性等问题。改进这些问题可显著提升模型性能（F1分数最高提升0.35）。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了NFMs的多种局限性，并证明通过解决这些问题可以显著提升模型性能，为未来研究提供了重要方向。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into the latent knowledge
encoded within Network Foundation Models (NFMs) that focuses on hidden
representations analysis rather than pure downstream task performance.
Different from existing efforts, we analyze the models through a three-part
evaluation: Embedding Geometry Analysis to assess representation space
utilization, Metric Alignment Assessment to measure correspondence with
domain-expert features, and Causal Sensitivity Testing to evaluate robustness
to protocol perturbations. Using five diverse network datasets spanning
controlled and real-world environments, we evaluate four state-of-the-art NFMs,
revealing that they all exhibit significant anisotropy, inconsistent feature
sensitivity patterns, an inability to separate the high-level context, payload
dependency, and other properties. Our work identifies numerous limitations
across all models and demonstrates that addressing them can significantly
improve model performance (by up to +0.35 $F_1$ score without architectural
changes).

Result: 方法对数值和近似误差具有鲁棒性，敏感性结果与重新训练和微调后的图像扩散模型样本变化相关。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效预测扩散模型样本对训练集扰动的敏感性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Training a diffusion model approximates a map from a data distribution $\rho$
to the optimal score function $s_t$ for that distribution. Can we differentiate
this map? If we could, then we could predict how the score, and ultimately the
model's samples, would change under small perturbations to the training set
before committing to costly retraining. We give a closed-form procedure for
computing this map's directional derivatives, relying only on black-box access
to a pre-trained score model and its derivatives with respect to its inputs. We
extend this result to estimate the sensitivity of a diffusion model's samples
to additive perturbations of its target measure, with runtime comparable to
sampling from a diffusion model and computing log-likelihoods along the sample
path. Our method is robust to numerical and approximation error, and the
resulting sensitivities correlate with changes in an image diffusion model's
samples after retraining and fine-tuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs通过捷径策略生成表面正确但推理不忠实的问题，提升因果一致性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用Jacobian敏感性估计内部影响，反事实强化信号，通过Minkowski组合器融合因果一致性和任务准确性奖励。

Result: 在4个数据集上，CE-PO平均提高准确性5.49%，同时增强对因果翻转和反事实编辑的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CE-PO有效减少奖励欺骗和虚假推理，提升模型因果一致性和鲁棒性，且不影响准确性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) trained with reinforcement objectives often
achieve superficially correct answers via shortcut strategies, pairing correct
outputs with spurious or unfaithful reasoning and degrading under small causal
perturbations. We introduce Causally-Enhanced Policy Optimization (CE-PO), a
drop-in reward-shaping framework that augments policy optimization with a
differentiable proxy for causal coherence along the generation pathway from
prompt (Z) to rationale (X) to answer (Y). CE-PO estimates model-internal
influence with Jacobian-based sensitivities, counterfactually hardens these
signals to suppress nuisance cues, and fuses the resulting coherence score with
task-accuracy feedback via a Minkowski (power-mean) combiner, exposing a single
tunable between accuracy and coherence trade-off. The unified reward integrates
with PPO/GRPO without architectural changes. Across reasoning benchmarks and
causal stress tests, CE-PO reduces reward hacking and unfaithful
chain-of-thought while improving robustness to correlation-causation flips and
light counterfactual edits, all at near-parity accuracy. Experimental results
across 4 datasets show that CE-PO improves accuracy over baselines by 5.49% on
average (up to 9.58%), while improving robustness to correlation-causation
flips and light counterfactual edits.

Motivation: 区块链的匿名性导致非法活动难以监管，需要能捕捉结构和时间依赖性的模型。

Result: 在Elliptic数据集上，实现了高召回率和低误报率（<1%），优于单一模型和基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时加密货币监控提供了实用且前瞻性的解决方案，并支持未来量子增强的金融安全分析。

Abstract: Blockchain Business applications and cryptocurrencies such as enable secure,
decentralized value transfer, yet their pseudonymous nature creates
opportunities for illicit activity, challenging regulators and exchanges in
anti money laundering (AML) enforcement. Detecting fraudulent transactions in
blockchain networks requires models that can capture both structural and
temporal dependencies while remaining resilient to noise, imbalance, and
adversarial behavior. In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that
integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT),
and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection.
Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves
high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate
below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular
architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future
integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph
neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term
adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature. Our findings highlight
ensemble GNNs as a practical and forward-looking solution for real-time
cryptocurrency monitoring, providing both immediate AML utility and a pathway
toward quantum-enhanced financial security analytics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Muon优化器在内存占用上的问题，同时保持其高效性和稳定性。

Method: 引入块量化技术，支持线性和动态量化方案。

Result: 内存占用减少74%，性能接近全精度Muon，在预训练和微调中表现优异。

Conclusion: 8-bit Muon在量化下保持稳定性和高效性，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer, based on matrix orthogonalization, has recently shown
faster convergence and up to 2x computational efficiency over AdamW in LLM
pretraining. Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model
weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this
overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under
dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for
extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using
blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We
demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering
$\sim$74\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In
extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while
outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb
tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B
model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help
explain this robustness under quantization.

Motivation: 人类移动预测因复杂的长程依赖和多尺度周期性行为而具有挑战性，需统一框架解决。

Method: 采用时间标记化分割轨迹，结合分层注意力与提示嵌入，冻结LLM主干以减少计算成本。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，RHYTHM整体准确率提升2.4%，周末预测提升5.0%，训练时间减少24.6%。

Conclusion: RHYTHM通过分层标记化和LLM冻结策略，显著提升了移动预测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Predicting human mobility is inherently challenging due to complex long-range
dependencies and multi-scale periodic behaviors. To address this, we introduce
RHYTHM (Reasoning with Hierarchical Temporal Tokenization for Human Mobility),
a unified framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) as
general-purpose spatio-temporal predictors and trajectory reasoners.
Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each
trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with
hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies,
thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical
information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding
pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets
via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM
backbone to capture complex interdependencies. Computationally, RHYTHM freezes
the pretrained LLM's backbone to reduce attention complexity and memory cost.
We evaluate our model against state-of-the-art methods using three real-world
datasets. Notably, RHYTHM achieves a 2.4% improvement in overall accuracy, a
5.0% increase on weekends, and a 24.6% reduction in training time. Code is

TL;DR: Impute-MACFM是一种基于掩码感知条件流匹配的表格数据填补方法，解决了传统方法在复杂缺失机制下的局限性，实现了高效、稳定的填补效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格数据（尤其是医疗领域的纵向数据）中缺失值普遍存在，传统填补方法要么假设过于严格，要么难以处理复杂的跨特征结构，而生成方法则存在不稳定和推理成本高的问题。

Method: 提出掩码感知条件流匹配框架（Impute-MACFM），通过掩码感知目标仅在缺失条目上构建轨迹，同时约束观测条目的预测速度接近零，结合稳定性惩罚、一致性正则化和时间衰减噪声注入。

Result: 在多样化基准测试中，Impute-MACFM实现了最先进的填补效果，比竞争方法更稳健、高效且质量更高。

Conclusion: 流匹配为表格缺失数据问题（包括纵向数据）提供了一个有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: Tabular data are central to many applications, especially longitudinal data
in healthcare, where missing values are common, undermining model fidelity and
reliability. Prior imputation methods either impose restrictive assumptions or
struggle with complex cross-feature structure, while recent generative
approaches suffer from instability and costly inference. We propose
Impute-MACFM, a mask-aware conditional flow matching framework for tabular
imputation that addresses missingness mechanisms, missing completely at random,
missing at random, and missing not at random. Its mask-aware objective builds
trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to
remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules.
Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii)
consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed
noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving
ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix
observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness.
Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while
delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing
approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular
missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods, exemplified by Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, play a central role in developing
reasoning models. However, these methods often suffer from a critical
overconfidence issue, which prevents them from achieving self-aware reasoning
models. In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration
group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously
enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle,
we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning
reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in
GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for
each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and
then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the
sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer
and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share
the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward
normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential
conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large
language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its
superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and
confidence calibration. The code of C$^2$GSPG is available at

Result: PIRO在MuJoCo、Gym-Robotics基准测试和真实动物行为建模任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TRRO为逆向强化学习提供了类似TRPO的稳定性保证，PIRO在实验中也优于现有方法。

Abstract: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) learns a reward function to explain
expert demonstrations. Modern IRL methods often use the adversarial (minimax)
formulation that alternates between reward and policy optimization, which often
lead to unstable training. Recent non-adversarial IRL approaches improve
stability by jointly learning reward and policy via energy-based formulations
but lack formal guarantees. This work bridges this gap. We first present a
unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly
maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing
the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust
Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic
improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process. We
instantiate TRRO into Proximal Inverse Reward Optimization (PIRO), a practical
and stable IRL algorithm. Theoretically, TRRO provides the IRL counterpart to
the stability guarantees of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) in forward
RL. Empirically, PIRO matches or surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in reward
recovery, policy imitation with high sample efficiency on MuJoCo and
Gym-Robotics benchmarks and a real-world animal behavior modeling task.

Motivation: INR缺乏系统配置策略，依赖临时方法导致结果不一致。

Method: 利用贝叶斯优化探索离散激活函数和连续初始化参数的联合空间。

Result: OptiINR提供全局最优配置，提升性能。

Conclusion: OptiINR为INR设计提供了理论基础，适用于多种信号处理任务。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a transformative
paradigm in signal processing and computer vision, excelling in tasks from
image reconstruction to 3D shape modeling. Yet their effectiveness is
fundamentally limited by the absence of principled strategies for optimal
configuration - spanning activation selection, initialization scales,
layer-wise adaptation, and their intricate interdependencies. These choices
dictate performance, stability, and generalization, but current practice relies
on ad-hoc heuristics, brute-force grid searches, or task-specific tuning, often
leading to inconsistent results across modalities. This work introduces
OptiINR, the first unified framework that formulates INR configuration as a
rigorous optimization problem. Leveraging Bayesian optimization, OptiINR
efficiently explores the joint space of discrete activation families - such as
sinusoidal (SIREN), wavelet-based (WIRE), and variable-periodic (FINER) - and
their associated continuous initialization parameters. This systematic approach
replaces fragmented manual tuning with a coherent, data-driven optimization
process. By delivering globally optimal configurations, OptiINR establishes a
principled foundation for INR design, consistently maximizing performance
across diverse signal processing applications.

Result: 在七个长期预测基准测试中，TimeExpert和TimeExpert-G优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TMOE机制有效提升了时间序列建模的性能，且无需额外结构修改。

Abstract: Transformer-based architectures dominate time series modeling by enabling
global attention over all timestamps, yet their rigid 'one-size-fits-all'
context aggregation fails to address two critical challenges in real-world
data: (1) inherent lag effects, where the relevance of historical timestamps to
a query varies dynamically; (2) anomalous segments, which introduce noisy
signals that degrade forecasting accuracy. To resolve these problems, we
propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism
that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a
distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each
query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this
local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength
in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention
mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and
Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific
version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G. Extensive experiments on
seven real-world long-term forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that TimeExpert
and TimeExpert-G outperform state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有奖励模型选择方法难以识别少数但正确的答案，限制了其有效性。

Method: 利用小规模指令调优模型合成高质量批评数据，通过对比模型生成与真实解决方案生成批评信号，用于训练验证器。

Result: Mirror-Verifier在解决方案准确性和模型诚实性（识别并避免回答超出能力范围的问题）上显著优于多数投票。

Conclusion: Mirror-Critique框架通过生成高质量批评数据，有效提升了验证器的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling via solution sampling and aggregation has become a key
paradigm for improving the reasoning performance of Large Language Models
(LLMs). While reward model selection is commonly employed in this approach, it
often fails to identify minority-yet-correct answers, which limits its
effectiveness beyond that of simple majority voting. We argue that this
limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier
training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that
trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage
the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with
ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize
high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier
not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start
the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The
resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by
generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify
score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental
results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting
in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to
recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.

TL;DR: CrystalGym是一个用于晶体材料设计的开源强化学习环境，旨在通过直接DFT信号优化材料性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习方法在材料设计中未充分利用DFT信号反馈，CrystalGym旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出CrystalGym环境，基于DFT计算反馈，评估多种强化学习算法在晶体设计中的表现。

Result: 不同算法在样本效率和收敛性上表现各异，但均未完全解决所有任务。

Conclusion: CrystalGym为强化学习与材料科学交叉研究提供了新平台，推动实际应用导向的机器学习研究。

Abstract: In silico design and optimization of new materials primarily relies on
high-accuracy atomic simulators that perform density functional theory (DFT)
calculations. While recent works showcase the strong potential of machine
learning to accelerate the material design process, they mostly consist of
generative approaches that do not use direct DFT signals as feedback to improve
training and generation mainly due to DFT's high computational cost. To aid the
adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online
reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL
environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark
common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing
various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for
challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are
directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms
we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and
ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to
optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we
include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with
reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for
CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and
material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical
applications. We therefore introduce a novel class of challenges for
reinforcement learning methods dealing with time-consuming reward signals,
paving the way for future interdisciplinary research for machine learning
motivated by real-world applications.

Method: 采用LSTM模型，结合日常行为特征序列，使用routine-aware augmentation和demographic personalization技术提升模型泛化性。

Result: 在36名老年人的6个月数据上，AUPRC从0.637提升至0.766。

Conclusion: 被动感知技术为老龄化人群的认知障碍监测提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Early detection of cognitive impairment is critical for timely diagnosis and
intervention, yet infrequent clinical assessments often lack the sensitivity
and temporal resolution to capture subtle cognitive declines in older adults.
Passive smartphone sensing has emerged as a promising approach for naturalistic
and continuous cognitive monitoring. Building on this potential, we implemented
a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model to detect cognitive impairment from
sequences of daily behavioral features, derived from multimodal sensing data
collected in an ongoing one-year study of older adults. Our key contributions
are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1)
routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing
each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic
personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from
individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on
6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area
Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and
demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of
scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive
sensing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习在时间序列预测中表现优异，但缺乏对决策过程的解释能力，尤其在需要信任的高风险场景中。现有可解释模型通常仅提供局部和片面的解释。

Method: ProtoTS基于去噪表示计算实例与原型相似性，保留丰富的异构信息。原型分层组织，捕获全局时间模式和局部细节变化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ProtoTS不仅预测精度优于现有方法，还能提供专家可指导的多层次解释。

Conclusion: ProtoTS在保持高精度的同时，实现了透明决策，支持模型理解和决策支持。

Abstract: While deep learning has achieved impressive performance in time series
forecasting, it becomes increasingly crucial to understand its decision-making
process for building trust in high-stakes scenarios. Existing interpretable
models often provide only local and partial explanations, lacking the
capability to reveal how heterogeneous and interacting input variables jointly
shape the overall temporal patterns in the forecast curve. We propose ProtoTS,
a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy
and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal
patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised
representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The
prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns
with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with
detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability.
Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF
dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast
accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model
understanding and decision support.

Motivation: 现有DAMs仅限于向量表示，无法处理概率分布。本文旨在扩展DAMs以支持分布存储和检索，连接经典DAMs与现代生成模型。

Method: 提出了一种基于2-Wasserstein距离的框架，定义了对数-求和-指数能量函数和基于最优传输的检索动态。

Result: 证明了指数存储容量，提供了在Wasserstein扰动下的定量检索保证，并在合成和真实数据上验证了模型。

Conclusion: 该工作将关联记忆从向量扩展到分布，为记忆增强学习中的分布存储和检索提供了新方法。

Abstract: Dense associative memories (DAMs) store and retrieve patterns via
energy-functional fixed points, but existing models are limited to vector
representations. We extend DAMs to probability distributions equipped with the
2-Wasserstein distance, focusing mainly on the Bures-Wasserstein class of
Gaussian densities. Our framework defines a log-sum-exp energy over stored
distributions and a retrieval dynamics aggregating optimal transport maps in a
Gibbs-weighted manner. Stationary points correspond to self-consistent
Wasserstein barycenters, generalizing classical DAM fixed points. We prove
exponential storage capacity, provide quantitative retrieval guarantees under
Wasserstein perturbations, and validate the model on synthetic and real-world
distributional tasks. This work elevates associative memory from vectors to
full distributions, bridging classical DAMs with modern generative modeling and
enabling distributional storage and retrieval in memory-augmented learning.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统研究了在科学机器学习中参数高效微调（PEFT）的应用，提出了一种基于频谱复杂度的频率自适应适配器（F-Adapter），在3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得了最优结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索参数高效微调（PEFT）在科学机器学习中的应用，特别是针对预训练大型算子模型（LOMs）的微调效果。

Method: 通过理论分析发现LoRA在Fourier层中的性能较差，而适配器具有更好的逼近能力。基于此，提出了频率自适应适配器（F-Adapter），根据频谱复杂度分配适配器容量。

Result: F-Adapter在多个3D Navier-Stokes基准测试中取得了最优结果，显著提升了泛化能力和频谱保真度。

Conclusion: F-Adapter是科学机器学习中参数高效微调的有效范式，填补了该领域的研究空白。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of powerful pre-trained models for
complex downstream tasks has proven effective in vision and language
processing, yet this paradigm remains unexplored in scientific machine
learning, where the objective is to model complex physical systems. We conduct
the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs)
obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that
the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance
on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that
stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within
Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and,
by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain
exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain.
Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical
characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce
Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity
based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to
low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency
components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on
multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both
generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques
commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to
explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an
effective paradigm for this domain.

Motivation: 纯熵最小化可能导致非泛化的捷径（如预测主导类），导致崩溃解。

Method: 通过非对称发散对齐和可学习预测器防止崩溃。

Result: ZeroSiam在视觉适应和大型语言模型推理任务中表现稳定且高效。

Conclusion: ZeroSiam简单有效，适用于多种模型和场景。

Abstract: Test-time entropy minimization helps adapt a model to novel environments and
incentivize its reasoning capability, unleashing the model's potential during
inference by allowing it to evolve and improve in real-time using its own
predictions, achieving promising performance. However, pure entropy
minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit
norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking
collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize
the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce
ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time
entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence
alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a
stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but
also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance
even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show
that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible
overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language
model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models,
including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.

Result: 实验证明CoSIFL在模型鲁棒性和服务器成本降低上优于现有方案。

Conclusion: CoSIFL通过集成设计有效提升了联邦学习的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative
model training while preserving data locality. However, it still faces
challenges from malicious or compromised clients, as well as difficulties in
incentivizing participants to contribute high-quality data under strict privacy
requirements. Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel
framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local
differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a
Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data
sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust
aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock
contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data
contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between
the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server
determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration
settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size,
privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client
game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional
attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect
system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that
CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and
reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated
design.

Motivation: 硬件加速的4位浮点格式（如MXFP4和NVFP4）在理论上能提升LLM推理效率，但其实际效果尚未验证。

Method: 提出了Micro-Rotated-GPTQ（MR-GPTQ），通过块级Hadamard变换和格式优化，针对FP4特性进行量化。

Result: MR-GPTQ在NVIDIA B200和RTX5090上分别实现了最高3.6x和6x的加速，且精度接近或优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FP4并非直接优于INT4，但通过MR-GPTQ等专用方法，可以在精度和性能之间实现新的平衡。

Abstract: The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats
such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to
revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical
benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and
NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and
real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods
struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably
neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two
scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To
bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the
classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to
FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and
format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of
high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible
overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of
the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and
2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on
RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches
or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the
point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an
automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock
a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.

Method: 提出Context Value Informed ICRL (CV-ICRL)，将Context Value作为训练阶段的显式信号，表示当前上下文下策略理论上可达到的理想性能。

Result: 实验证明CV-ICRL有效缓解性能下降，提升ICRL能力。

Conclusion: CV-ICRL通过Context Value解决了Contextual Ambiguity问题，显著提升了ICRL的性能和适应性。

Abstract: In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past
experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches
train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online
RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our
experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a
continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically,
we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own
stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly
resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a
vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we
introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed
ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing
the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current
context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant
information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We
prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap
relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two
methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time.
Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that
CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL
abilities across various tasks and environments. The source code and data of
this paper are available at

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at general mathematical reasoning but fail
catastrophically on specialized technical mathematics. In wireless
communications, where problems require precise manipulation of
information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing
formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent
performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models
(0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through
domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight
is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable
correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human
feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027
problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with
binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints
without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on
WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times
fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training
nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B

Motivation: 现有RLVR训练方法在rollout阶段计算成本高，且存在冗余问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出SPEC-RL框架，利用推测解码技术重用轨迹段，避免冗余生成。

Result: 实验表明SPEC-RL将rollout时间减少2-3倍，且不影响策略质量。

Conclusion: SPEC-RL是一种通用的rollout阶段优化方法，适用于主流RL算法，可扩展RLVR训练规模。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with
verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning.
However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally
expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization,
objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur
diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations.
We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a
large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we
propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with
the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative
prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant
generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math
reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500,
OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout
time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage
enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g.,
PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large
reasoning models. Our code is available at https://github.com/ShopeeLLM/Spec-RL

Motivation: 现实世界中的回归任务数据分布往往严重倾斜，模型主要从多数样本中学习，难以准确预测少数标签。尽管不平衡分类已被广泛研究，但不平衡回归仍相对未被探索。

Method: 提出LatentDiff框架，利用条件扩散模型和优先级生成在潜在表示空间中合成高质量特征，适用于高维数据。

Result: 在三个DIR基准测试中，LatentDiff在少数区域表现出显著改进，同时保持整体准确性。

Conclusion: LatentDiff填补了深度不平衡回归中数据级解决方案的空白，适用于多种数据模态，计算高效。

Abstract: In many real-world regression tasks, the data distribution is heavily skewed,
and models learn predominantly from abundant majority samples while failing to
predict minority labels accurately. While imbalanced classification has been
extensively studied, imbalanced regression remains relatively unexplored. Deep
imbalanced regression (DIR) represents cases where the input data are
high-dimensional and unstructured. Although several data-level approaches for
tabular imbalanced regression exist, deep imbalanced regression currently lacks
dedicated data-level solutions suitable for high-dimensional data and relies
primarily on algorithmic modifications. To fill this gap, we propose
LatentDiff, a novel framework that uses conditional diffusion models with
priority-based generation to synthesize high-quality features in the latent
representation space. LatentDiff is computationally efficient and applicable
across diverse data modalities, including images, text, and other
high-dimensional inputs. Experiments on three DIR benchmarks demonstrate
substantial improvements in minority regions while maintaining overall
accuracy.

Result: ATDP显著减少训练时间（约90%），提供可比或更好的隐私保护，且对模型性能影响极小。

Conclusion: ATDP是一种高效、灵活的隐私增强方法，可无缝集成现有DP流程或直接应用于非私有模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal
information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of
differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise
into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing
model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients
associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time,
strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve
the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight
through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of
vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive
and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage
of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a
result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight
post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise
primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally
affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated
into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to
non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined
with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP
pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD
methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning,
shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving
comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.

Result: 理论证明冗余策略降低了映射复杂度，提高了平滑性。实验表明预测更大子空间显著提升精度。

Conclusion: 子空间回归适用于多种任务，如参数特征问题、偏微分方程求解等，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear
subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach
becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on
parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute
subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding
offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown
parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is
high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible
or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression,
introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural
network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further
simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting
subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically
that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic
eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for
general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show
that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are
predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace
regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric
eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and
solution of parametric partial differential equations.

Abstract: We present NanoFlux, a novel adversarial framework for generating targeted
training data to improve LLM reasoning, where adversarially-generated datasets
containing fewer than 200 examples outperform conventional fine-tuning
approaches. The framework employs a competitive dynamic between models
alternating as Attacker and Defender, supervised by a tool-augmented Judge,
synthesizing multi-step questions with explanatory annotations that target
specific reasoning capabilities. Fine-tuning a 4B-parameter model on
NanoFlux-generated data yields performance gains across diverse domains
compared to full-benchmark fine-tuning: +5.9% on mathematical reasoning
(GSMHard), +3.6% on scientific reasoning (GenomeBench), and +16.6% on medical
reasoning (MultiMedQA), while reducing computational requirements by 3-14x.
Ablation studies reveal a non-monotonic relationship between dataset
characteristics and model performance, uncovering domain-specific optimal
points for question complexity and reasoning quality. NanoFlux automates
training data generation through embedding-based novelty filtering,
tool-augmented evaluation, and multi-hop reasoning, suggesting that future
model improvements may lie in the intelligent synthesis of small, precisely
targeted training datasets.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of antibody-antigen (Ab-Ag) interfaces is critical for
vaccine design, immunodiagnostics, and therapeutic antibody development.
However, achieving reliable predictions from sequences alone remains a
challenge. In this paper, we present ABCONFORMER, a model based on the
Conformer backbone that captures both local and global features of a
biosequence. To accurately capture Ab-Ag interactions, we introduced the
physics-inspired sliding attention, enabling residue-level contact recovery
without relying on three-dimensional structural data. ABConformer can
accurately predict paratopes and epitopes given the antibody and antigen
sequence, and predict pan-epitopes on the antigen without antibody information.
In comparison experiments, ABCONFORMER achieves state-of-the-art performance on
a recent SARS-CoV-2 Ab-Ag dataset, and surpasses widely used sequence-based
methods for antibody-agnostic epitope prediction. Ablation studies further
quantify the contribution of each component, demonstrating that, compared to
conventional cross-attention, sliding attention significantly enhances the
precision of epitope prediction. To facilitate reproducibility, we will release
the code under an open-source license upon acceptance.

Abstract: Inference-time control of diffusion models aims to steer model outputs to
satisfy new constraints without retraining. Previous approaches have mostly
relied on heuristic guidance or have been coupled with Sequential Monte Carlo
(SMC) for bias correction. In this paper, we propose a flexible alternative
based on replica exchange, an algorithm designed initially for sampling
problems. We refer to this method as the CREPE (Controlling with REPlica
Exchange). Unlike SMC, CREPE: (1) generates particles sequentially, (2)
maintains high diversity in the generated samples after a burn-in period, and
(3) enables online refinement or early termination. We demonstrate its
versatility across various tasks, including temperature annealing,
reward-tilting, model composition and classifier-free guidance debiasing, with
competitive performance compared to prior SMC methods.

Abstract: Prognostic information is essential for decision-making in breast cancer
management. Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic
prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less
costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and
ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication
frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in
breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained
prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used
for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER
cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic
tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme
Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum
of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration
improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from
0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC
increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3
predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing
information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict
survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age,
nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values,
indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation
in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and
ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo
RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where
relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is
likely.

Result: 在200个随机市场场景中，该方法平均奖励最高，初始收益快且持续表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接学习最优策略而非环境模型，实现了更高效的资产-负债管理。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for Asset-Liability Management (ALM) by
employing continuous-time Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a linear-quadratic
(LQ) formulation that incorporates both interim and terminal objectives. We
develop a model-free, policy gradient-based soft actor-critic algorithm
tailored to ALM for dynamically synchronizing assets and liabilities. To ensure
an effective balance between exploration and exploitation with minimal tuning,
we introduce adaptive exploration for the actor and scheduled exploration for
the critic. Our empirical study evaluates this approach against two enhanced
traditional financial strategies, a model-based continuous-time RL method, and
three state-of-the-art RL algorithms. Evaluated across 200 randomized market
scenarios, our method achieves higher average rewards than all alternative
strategies, with rapid initial gains and sustained superior performance. The
outperformance stems not from complex neural networks or improved parameter
estimation, but from directly learning the optimal ALM strategy without
learning the environment.

Abstract: Accurate aircraft trajectory prediction is critical for air traffic
management, airline operations, and environmental assessment. This paper
introduces NODE-FDM, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equations-based Flight
Dynamics Model trained on Quick Access Recorder (QAR) data. By combining
analytical kinematic relations with data-driven components, NODE-FDM achieves a
more accurate reproduction of recorded trajectories than state-of-the-art
models such as a BADA-based trajectory generation methodology (BADA4
performance model combined with trajectory control routines), particularly in
the descent phase of the flight. The analysis demonstrates marked improvements
across altitude, speed, and mass dynamics. Despite current limitations,
including limited physical constraints and the limited availability of QAR
data, the results demonstrate the potential of physics-informed neural ordinary
differential equations as a high-fidelity, data-driven approach to aircraft
performance modelling. Future work will extend the framework to incorporate a
full modelling of the lateral dynamics of the aircraft.

Motivation: 不规则多元时间序列（IMTS）在医疗和金融等领域普遍存在，但异步采样和不规则间隔导致数据表示和动态依赖捕获困难。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，ASTGI表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ASTGI有效解决了IMTS的表示和依赖捕获问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) are prevalent in critical domains
like healthcare and finance, where accurate forecasting is vital for proactive
decision-making. However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals
inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to
accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without
introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex
dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges,
we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework.
Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point
Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a
learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive
Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in
the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a
Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on
these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction
weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points.
Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by
aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing
regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 两尺度模型和二阶差分退出机制能有效提升循环深度变换器的效率和性能。

Abstract: Recurrent-depth transformers scale test-time compute by iterating latent
computations before emitting tokens. We study the geometry of these iterates
and argue for a simple, \emph{two-scale} operational picture: (i) within a
looped block, updates act as \emph{small-scale refinements}; (ii) across
consecutive blocks, states undergo a \emph{larger-scale drift}. Across
checkpoints, our measurements show that loop steps become \emph{smaller} and
increasingly \emph{orthogonal} to one another, indicating better local modeling
of fine structure rather than merely pushing in a single direction. These
dynamics motivate an early-exit mechanism based on the model's second-order
difference in step-size, which we show is superior in terms of performance,
stability and time-efficiency, when compared to the KL-divergence exit strategy
of Geiping et al. and its naive first-order counterpart.

Abstract: Regression is essential across many domains but remains challenging in
high-dimensional settings, where existing methods often lose spatial structure
or demand heavy storage. In this work, we address the problem of matrix-valued
regression, where each sample is naturally represented as a matrix. We propose
MELCOT, a hybrid model that integrates a classical machine learning-based
Marginal Estimation (ME) block with a deep learning-based Learnable-Cost
Optimal Transport (LCOT) block. The ME block estimates data marginals to
preserve spatial information, while the LCOT block learns complex global
features. This design enables MELCOT to inherit the strengths of both classical
and deep learning methods. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets and
domains demonstrate that MELCOT consistently outperforms all baselines while
remaining highly efficient.

Abstract: Despite Large Language Models' remarkable capabilities, understanding their
internal representations remains challenging. Mechanistic interpretability
tools such as sparse autoencoders (SAEs) were developed to extract
interpretable features from LLMs but lack temporal dependency modeling,
instantaneous relation representation, and more importantly theoretical
guarantees, undermining both the theoretical foundations and the practical
confidence necessary for subsequent analyses. While causal representation
learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent
concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to
inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable
temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for
LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and
instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees
and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world
complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we
successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations. Our
findings show that modeling both temporal and instantaneous conceptual
relationships advances the interpretability of LLMs.

Result: 实验表明，Epsilon-Scheduling能有效避免次优迁移，并在多种配置下显著提升预期鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Epsilon-Scheduling是一种有效的鲁棒微调策略，能够平衡任务适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern
machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to
simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to
adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust
pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less
understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from
such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust
models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to
poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \emph{suboptimal transfer}. In
challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting
performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find
that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the
beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we
propose a novel heuristic, \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over
perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer.
Additionally, we introduce \emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures
performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive
evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test
time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained
models and five datasets) show that \emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully
prevents \emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected
robustness.

Abstract: The Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem and its dynamic counterpart, the
Schr\"odinger bridge (SB) problem, play an important role in modern machine
learning, linking generative modeling with optimal transport theory. While
recent advances in discrete diffusion and flow models have sparked growing
interest in applying SB methods to discrete domains, there is still no reliable
way to evaluate how well these methods actually solve the underlying problem.
We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces.
Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically
known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building
this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and
additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\alpha$-CSBM
algorithm. We demonstrate the utility of our benchmark by evaluating both
existing and new solvers in high-dimensional discrete settings. This work
provides the first step toward proper evaluation of SB methods on discrete
spaces, paving the way for more reproducible future studies.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成式AI和设计问题提供了实用的优化工具。

Abstract: Under the data manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional data are concentrated
near a low-dimensional manifold. We study the problem of Riemannian
optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through
the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by
classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class
of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our
key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to
the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function
enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and
Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection
between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data
distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied
parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score
networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building
on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms --
Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD)
-- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate
manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference
tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical
generative and design applications.

Abstract: Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT)
improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling
implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight
by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can
efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of
multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains
unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from
gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the
training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph
reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during
training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that
autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage
that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that
during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an
important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search
ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions.
The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and
exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem
structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights
to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is
correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the
growth of logits further validate our theory.

TL;DR: 该论文提出基于Kolmogorov-Arnold网络（KANs）的特征选择方法，在分类和回归任务中表现优异且可解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据集需要有效的特征选择以提高预测性能、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出了四种基于KAN的特征选择方法（KAN-L1、KAN-L2、KAN-SI、KAN-KO），并与经典基线方法（LASSO、随机森林、互信息、SVM-RFE）进行比较。

Result: KAN-based方法在结构化和合成数据集中表现优异，尤其在回归任务中KAN-L2和KAN-SI表现稳健，分类任务中KAN-L1、KAN-KO和KAN-SI有时优于其他方法。

Conclusion: KAN-based特征选择是一种强大且可解释的替代传统方法的方法，能够揭示非线性和多变量特征相关性。

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets require effective feature selection to improve
predictive performance, interpretability, and robustness. We propose and
evaluate feature selection methods for tabular datasets based on
Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs), which parameterize feature transformations
through splines, enabling direct access to interpretable importance measures.
We introduce four KAN-based selectors ($\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-SI}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$) and compare them against classical
baselines (LASSO, Random Forest, Mutual Information, SVM-RFE) across multiple
classification and regression tabular dataset benchmarks. Average (over three
retention levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\%) F1 scores and $R^2$ score results
reveal that KAN-based selectors, particularly $\textit{KAN-L2}$,
$\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-SI}$, and $\textit{KAN-KO}$, are competitive
with and sometimes superior to classical baselines in structured and synthetic
datasets. However, $\textit{KAN-L1}$ is often too aggressive in regression,
removing useful features, while $\textit{KAN-L2}$ underperforms in
classification, where simple coefficient shrinkage misses complex feature
interactions. $\textit{KAN-L2}$ and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ provide robust
performance on noisy regression datasets and heterogeneous datasets, aligning
closely with ensemble predictors. In classification tasks, KAN selectors such
as $\textit{KAN-L1}$, $\textit{KAN-KO}$, and $\textit{KAN-SI}$ sometimes
surpass the other selectors by eliminating redundancy, particularly in
high-dimensional multi-class data. Overall, our findings demonstrate that
KAN-based feature selection provides a powerful and interpretable alternative
to traditional methods, capable of uncovering nonlinear and multivariate
feature relevance beyond sparsity or impurity-based measures.

TL;DR: Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR) 是一种通过图结构一致性来优化模型特征表示的新框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络学习的特征表示可能包含噪声，导致类间相似性与预测语义不一致。GCR 旨在通过图一致性层（GCLs）解决这一问题。

Method: GCR 在任意深度引入无参数的 GCLs，通过对齐特征相似性图和全局类感知预测图来优化特征表示。

Result: 实验表明 GCR 能提升特征结构的清晰性、类内凝聚力和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GCR 提供了一种从预测结构中学习的新视角，适用于多种网络和数据集。

Abstract: We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that
injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the
learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature
representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model
to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks
learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities
that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by
introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths.
Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a
global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax
prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces
that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior,
acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR
introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive
weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes.
This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress
noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or
training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic
structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR
promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved
generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction
structure. [Project website](https://darcyddx.github.io/gcr/)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散语言模型的灵活性导致训练与推理路径不匹配，影响模型性能。

Method: 提出P-ELBO训练目标和PAPL方法，将规划器动态纳入训练目标。

Result: 在蛋白质序列建模、文本生成和代码生成任务中均取得显著提升。

Conclusion: PAPL方法有效解决了训练与推理路径不匹配问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel
generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or
planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather
than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths,
planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used
during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work,
we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the
standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not
accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap,
we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly
incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective.
Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and
effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that
aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL
delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain
in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text
generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.

Motivation: 现有方法通常将多重图的各层独立处理或简单合并，忽略了层间依赖关系且难以扩展。

Method: 将多重链接预测建模为多视图边分类问题，构建每层边的视图序列，并应用跨层自注意力融合信息。提出了两种模型：Trans-SLE（基于静态嵌入的轻量级Transformer）和Trans-GAT（结合GAT编码器和Transformer融合）。

Result: 在六个公开多重图数据集上，相比基线方法（MELL、HOPLP-MUL、RMNE）取得了显著的macro-F_1提升。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、可扩展，兼容预计算嵌入和GNN编码器，解决了多重图链接预测中的层间依赖和扩展性问题。

Abstract: Multiplex graphs capture diverse relations among shared nodes. Most
predictors either collapse layers or treat them independently. This loses
crucial inter-layer dependencies and struggles with scalability. To overcome
this, we frame multiplex link prediction as multi-view edge classification. For
each node pair, we construct a sequence of per-layer edge views and apply
cross-layer self-attention to fuse evidence for the target layer. We present
two models as instances of this framework: Trans-SLE, a lightweight transformer
over static embeddings, and Trans-GAT, which combines layer-specific GAT
encoders with transformer fusion. To ensure scalability and fairness, we
introduce a Union--Set candidate pool and two leakage-free protocols:
cross-layer and inductive subgraph generalization. Experiments on six public
multiplex datasets show consistent macro-F_1 gains over strong baselines (MELL,
HOPLP-MUL, RMNE). Our approach is simple, scalable, and compatible with both
precomputed embeddings and GNN encoders.

TL;DR: PATCH是一种混合稀疏框架，通过可学习的掩码选择机制在0%到50%的稀疏率之间实现连续调节，平衡精度与加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有剪枝方法在稀疏模式上存在不足，非结构化稀疏难以加速，半结构化稀疏（如2:4模式）则牺牲模型质量。

Method: PATCH将权重矩阵划分为块，每个块通过可学习掩码选择为密集或2:4稀疏，支持非均匀稀疏分布。

Result: 在0.5B至8B参数的模型中，PATCH缩小了与密集模型的精度差距，并实现1.18x-1.38x加速。

Conclusion: PATCH在精度与加速间取得更好平衡，优于现有2:4剪枝方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver impressive performance but incur
prohibitive memory and compute costs at deployment. Model pruning is an
effective way to reduce these overheads, yet existing approaches face
challenges: unstructured sparsity, where nonzeros can appear anywhere,
preserves accuracy but yields irregular access patterns that prevent GPU
acceleration, while semi-structured 2:4 sparsity is hardware-friendly but
enforces a rigid 50% pattern that degrades model quality. To bridge this gap,
we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous
sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles,
assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask
selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over
accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across
layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B
parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while
delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU,
PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while
improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning
method, MaskLLM.

Result: URS在100多种VRP变体（包括90多种未见变体）上表现优异。

Conclusion: URS是首个能处理100多种VRP变体的单一神经求解器。

Abstract: Multi-task neural routing solvers have emerged as a promising paradigm for
their ability to solve multiple vehicle routing problems (VRPs) using a single
model. However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem
constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits
their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this
critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of
zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single
model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data
representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification,
thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain
expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently
learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top
of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively
adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot
generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction
mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise
masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more
than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more
than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural
solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力机制存在二次计算复杂性和信息不平衡问题，限制了其在长上下文窗口中的扩展性和鲁棒性。

Method: 通过将注意力映射与查询和键之间的传输计划联系起来，利用低秩约束和可学习的枢轴度量，实现双重随机性和线性时间计算。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，LOTFormer在准确性和效率上均优于现有的线性和基于传输的注意力方法。

Conclusion: LOTFormer提供了一种高效且鲁棒的注意力机制，适用于长上下文窗口任务。

Abstract: Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities.
However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism
poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large
body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention
as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve
linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention
mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can
over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow.
Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token
participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention
mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability.
We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously
linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between
attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The
central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning
it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two
entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\to$ pivot and pivot $\to$ keys)
and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention
matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \ll n$, and
applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \times n$ map.
The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer
achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing
prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and
efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法在计算影响函数时需要处理大规模、病态的Hessian矩阵，近似方法（如GGN和K-FAC）虽被提出，但其对数据归因性能的影响尚不明确。

Method: 在分类任务中，通过实验评估Hessian近似质量对影响函数归因性能的影响，并分解不同近似步骤的贡献。

Result: 更好的Hessian近似能显著提升归因准确性，K-FAC特征值与GGN/EK-FAC的差异是主要误差来源。

Conclusion: 研究为未来平衡计算效率和归因准确性提供了指导，强调了关键近似步骤的重要性。

Abstract: Influence functions offer a principled way to trace model predictions back to
training data, but their use in deep learning is hampered by the need to invert
a large, ill-conditioned Hessian matrix. Approximations such as Generalised
Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have
been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear
how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance.
Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are
derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even
lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the
effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a
controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian
approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering
justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further
decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and
evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch
between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority
of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations
are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability
and attribution accuracy.

Result: 在五个基准数据集上表现优于基线，保持高预测准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在分布内和分布外场景下均表现出高效性和适应性。

Abstract: The imperative of user privacy protection and regulatory compliance
necessitates sensitive data removal in model training, yet this process often
induces distributional shifts that undermine model performance-particularly in
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We propose a novel data removal approach
that enhances deep predictive models through factor decorrelation and loss
perturbation. Our approach introduces: (1) a discriminative-preserving factor
decorrelation module employing dynamic adaptive weight adjustment and iterative
representation updating to reduce feature redundancy and minimize inter-feature
correlations. (2) a smoothed data removal mechanism with loss perturbation that
creates information-theoretic safeguards against data leakage during removal
operations. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that our
approach outperforms other baselines and consistently achieves high predictive
accuracy and robustness even under significant distribution shifts. The results
highlight its superior efficiency and adaptability in both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution scenarios.

Conclusion: PHASE能够捕捉物理规律而非表面相关性，为地表建模和其他复杂科学工作流提供了实用且物理一致的加速方案。

Abstract: Large-scale numerical simulations underpin modern scientific discovery but
remain constrained by prohibitive computational costs. AI surrogates offer
acceleration, yet adoption in mission-critical settings is limited by concerns
over physical plausibility, trustworthiness, and the fusion of heterogeneous
data. We introduce PHASE, a modular deep-learning framework for
physics-integrated, heterogeneity-aware surrogates in scientific simulations.
PHASE combines data-type-aware encoders for heterogeneous inputs with
multi-level physics-based constraints that promote consistency from local
dynamics to global system behavior. We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical
(BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth
System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first
scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the
first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise
requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction
in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a
pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong
generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These
results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather
than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent
acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.

Abstract: Data selection is designed to accelerate learning with preserved performance.
To achieve this, a fundamental thought is to identify informative data samples
with significant contributions to the training. In this work, we propose
\textbf{Evolved Sampling} (\textbf{ES}), a simple yet effective framework for
\emph{dynamic} sampling along the training process. This method conducts \em
batch \em level data selection based on the dynamics of losses and augmented
\emph{loss differences}, which enables flexible \emph{frequency tuning}, and
hence significantly reduces the back propagation time with maintained model
performance. Due to its conciseness, ES is also readily extensible to
incorporate \em set \em level data selection (to form ES with pruning,
\textbf{ESWP}) for further accelerations. As a plug-and-play framework, ES(WP)
consistently achieves lossless training accelerations across various
pre-training and post-training tasks, saving up to nearly 45\% wall-clock time.
Our results motivate further investigations on the data efficiency aspect of
modern large-scale machine learning.

Result: GEMS比PSRO快6倍，内存减少1.3倍，同时获得更高奖励。

Conclusion: GEMS克服了PSRO的低效问题，适用于多种多智能体学习场景。

Abstract: Scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) remains a central
challenge for AI. Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response
Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing
full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs.
We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free
framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent
anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing
the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts,
multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB
oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within
the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the
need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of
Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn
Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster,
has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards
simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic
guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence
enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上，POC比基线方法性能提升2%-17%。

Conclusion: POC有效解决了实时MILP问题中的重新求解决策问题，填补了相关文献空白。

Abstract: A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an
optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data
platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time
operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization
problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when
to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem
poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and
solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial
samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP
structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly
applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing
literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth
objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework
called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which
systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when
deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the
relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test
our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show
that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side
benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP
benchmarks and evaluation criteria.

Result: 实验显示Drift-Adapter在MTEB文本语料和CLIP图像模型升级中恢复95-99%的检索召回率，延迟增加小于10微秒，计算成本降低100倍以上。

Conclusion: Drift-Adapter是一种实用解决方案，支持敏捷模型部署，显著减少升级成本和中断。

Abstract: Upgrading embedding models in production vector databases typically requires
re-encoding the entire corpus and rebuilding the Approximate Nearest Neighbor
(ANN) index, leading to significant operational disruption and computational
cost. This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable
transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model
versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter
enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full
re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations:
Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on
a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text
corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter
recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full
re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to
operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving,
Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates
upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to
varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems,
and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating
Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法内存开销大，阻碍实际部署，而模型激活是主要内存消耗源。

Method: 提出LoRAct方法，在线压缩激活数据，无需校准数据，并采用新型低秩矩阵分解算法。

Result: 实验显示LoRAct减少约80%激活内存，性能与LoRA相当。

Conclusion: LoRAct提供灵活高效的内存压缩策略，适用于视觉和语言任务。

Abstract: The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant
attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods
have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their
substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders
practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations
constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch
sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains
consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient
fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior
work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that
can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any
calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based
orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices,
offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared
to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks
demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces
activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted
LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance. The source code is

Result: 群不变结构能显著提升近似精度，且不影响估计误差，泛化误差对对称函数有明显优势。

Conclusion: 编码群不变结构在神经网络中对对称目标函数具有明确的统计优势。

Abstract: We investigate the generalization error of group-invariant neural networks
within the Barron framework. Our analysis shows that incorporating
group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma} \le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor
is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation
accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity
of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant
counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the
incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve
significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We
further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where
$\delta_{G,\Gamma,\sigma}\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous
theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in
neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target
functions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models often struggle to maintain performance under
distribution shifts, leading to inaccurate predictions on unseen future data.
In this work, we investigate whether and under what conditions models can
achieve such a generalization when relying solely on past data. We explore two
primary approaches: convex combinations of past model parameters
(\emph{parameter interpolation}) and explicit extrapolation beyond the convex
hull of past parameters (\emph{parameter extrapolation}). We benchmark several
methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including
language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper
categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and
historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that
none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of
using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of
access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying
data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of
generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when
evaluating claims of such generalization.

Conclusion: CRIB通过直接预测和噪声过滤，显著提升了不完整时间序列的预测性能。

Abstract: Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time
series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of
research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing
data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework
that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting
on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there
is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process
susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we
conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct
supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade
prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves
away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time
series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a
novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a
unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to
learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values
while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on
four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts
accurately even under high missing rates. Our code is available in

Conclusion: 优化器选择显著影响量化模型性能，Shampoo在量化感知训练中表现最佳。

Abstract: As new optimizers gain traction and model quantization becomes standard for
efficient deployment, a key question arises: how does the choice of optimizer
affect model performance in the presence of quantization? Despite progress in
both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains
limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model
robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization
(PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision
models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore
the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply
PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different
optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio
(MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different
optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only
isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and
propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized
models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We
find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not
remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest
accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware
training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest
parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.

Result: IDMVAE在挑战性数据集上实现了共享与私有信息的清晰分离，生成质量和语义一致性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IDMVAE通过互补的组件设计，有效解决了多模态数据中的信息分离问题，提升了生成性能。

Abstract: Multimodal data are prevalent across various domains, and learning robust
representations of such data is paramount to enhancing generation quality and
downstream task performance. To handle heterogeneity and interconnections among
different modalities, recent multimodal generative models extract shared and
private (modality-specific) information with two separate variables. Despite
attempts to enforce disentanglement between these two variables, these methods
struggle with challenging datasets where the likelihood model is insufficient.
In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to
explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based
regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for
extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy
removal using generative augmentations. We further introduce diffusion models
to improve the capacity of latent priors. These newly proposed components are
complementary to each other. Compared to existing approaches, IDMVAE shows a
clean separation between shared and private information, demonstrating superior
generation quality and semantic coherence on challenging datasets.

Result: 在809株E. coli数据上表现优异，CIP的MCC达0.926，GEN的F1-score达0.691。

Conclusion: 结合序列和特征学习的集成模型能有效克服单一方法的局限性。

Abstract: Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) is a rapidly escalating global health crisis.
While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes,
current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning
models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the
sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art
sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally
expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To
address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework
that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We
developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data.
This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful
gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature
interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of
809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying
class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier
performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro
F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also
show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes
like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for
resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a
feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the
limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.

Method: MosaCD结合CI测试和LLM注释生成高置信度种子集，利用位置偏置过滤幻觉，并采用置信度传播策略。

Result: MosaCD在多个真实世界图中比现有方法更准确，得益于初始种子的可靠性和传播策略。

Conclusion: MosaCD通过高置信度种子和稳健传播策略，显著提升了因果图构建的准确性。

Abstract: Learning causal structure from observational data is central to scientific
modeling and decision-making. Constraint-based methods aim to recover
conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph
(DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient
v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds,
assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets --
assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the
final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as
experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge
orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly
assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We
propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a
high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To
filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs'
positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel
confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges
first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across
multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph
construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the
improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.

Result: EVO-LRP在可解释性指标和视觉一致性上优于传统XAI方法，对类特定特征敏感。

Conclusion: 通过任务特定的优化，可以系统性提升归因质量。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) methods help identify which image regions influence a
model's prediction, but often face a trade-off between detail and
interpretability. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) offers a model-aware
alternative. However, LRP implementations commonly rely on heuristic rule sets
that are not optimized for clarity or alignment with model behavior. We
introduce EVO-LRP, a method that applies Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution
Strategy (CMA-ES) to tune LRP hyperparameters based on quantitative
interpretability metrics, such as faithfulness or sparseness. EVO-LRP
outperforms traditional XAI approaches in both interpretability metric
performance and visual coherence, with strong sensitivity to class-specific
features. These findings demonstrate that attribution quality can be
systematically improved through principled, task-specific optimization.

Conclusion: SKETCHLORD是结构化近似工具包的有力补充，适用于大规模算子如深度学习Hessian矩阵。

Abstract: Many relevant machine learning and scientific computing tasks involve
high-dimensional linear operators accessible only via costly matrix-vector
products. In this context, recent advances in sketched methods have enabled the
construction of *either* low-rank *or* diagonal approximations from few
matrix-vector products. This provides great speedup and scalability, but
approximation errors arise due to the assumed simpler structure. This work
introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank
*and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus*
Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically
that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant
(diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as
a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive
experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's
performance in accurately recovering these structures. This positions it as a
valuable addition to the structured approximation toolkit, particularly when
high-fidelity approximations are desired for large-scale operators, such as the
deep learning Hessian.

Result: 在标准增量学习基准测试中表现优异，解决了灾难性遗忘问题，同时保持内存效率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅性能优越，还提供了可扩展且高效的持续学习解决方案。

Abstract: We present a holistic framework for continual model merging that intervenes
at three critical stages: pre-merging, during merging, and post-merging-to
address two fundamental challenges in continual learning. In particular,
conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task
vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging
when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information.
Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model
within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies
per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task
interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available
optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit
old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation
discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing
overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints
without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard
class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our
approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable
and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.

Conclusion: 扩散模型的Fisher近似秩1，改进的EWC与重放互补，有效约束漂移并促进参数共享。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in
neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation
(EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to
distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across
tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we
study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce
high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that,
in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become
strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and
aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1
variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the
dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach
to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On
class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10,
ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces
forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular,
forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved
on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an
approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a
strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks,
while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.

Abstract: Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains,
yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across
datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple
linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant
deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of
linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of
characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free
setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and
explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel
independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the
noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads
to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence
of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need
for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two
complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank
reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank
Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel
adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a
noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard
benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our
theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several
settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical
theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust,
interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.

Result: 实验表明，GraphIFE在多个数据集上优于基线方法，表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: GraphIFE通过解决合成节点质量不一致问题，显著提升了图不平衡条件下的模型性能。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the disproportionate distribution of
samples across different classes within a dataset, where the minority classes
are significantly underrepresented. This issue is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Most graph neural networks (GNNs) implicitly assume a
balanced class distribution and therefore often fail to account for the
challenges introduced by class imbalance, which can lead to biased learning and
degraded performance on minority classes. We identify a quality inconsistency
problem in synthesized nodes, which leads to suboptimal performance under graph
imbalance conditions. To mitigate this issue, we propose GraphIFE (Graph
Invariant Feature Extraction), a novel framework designed to mitigate quality
inconsistency in synthesized nodes. Our approach incorporates two key concepts
from graph invariant learning and introduces strategies to strengthen the
embedding space representation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to
identify invariant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's
efficiency and robust generalization, as GraphIFE consistently outperforms
various baselines across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at

Conclusion: DRIK有效解决了信息泄漏和OOD泛化问题，显著提升了时空估计性能。

Abstract: Inductive kriging supports high-resolution spatio-temporal estimation with
sparse sensor networks, but conventional training-evaluation setups often
suffer from information leakage and poor out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization. We find that the common 2x2 spatio-temporal split allows test
data to influence model selection through early stopping, obscuring the true
OOD characteristics of inductive kriging. To address this issue, we propose a
3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets,
eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on
this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive
Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in
mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy
at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to
capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in
information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled
subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization. Experiments on six diverse
spatio-temporal datasets show that DRIK consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving up to 12.48% lower MAE while maintaining strong scalability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的全局注意力机制Clebsch-Gordan Transformer，通过Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现，显著提升了计算效率和模型表达能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变Transformer仅支持低阶等变特征和局部上下文窗口，限制了其表达能力和性能。

Method: 采用Clebsch-Gordon卷积在SO(3)不可约表示上实现高效全局注意力，支持高阶等变特征，并利用Clebsch-Gordon矩阵的稀疏性优化计算。

Result: 在多个基准测试（如n-body模拟、QM9、ModelNet点云分类和机器人抓取数据集）中，GPU内存占用、速度和准确性均优于现有等变Transformer。

Conclusion: Clebsch-Gordan Transformer通过高效全局注意力和高阶等变特征建模，显著提升了等变Transformer的性能和适用性。

Abstract: The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of
transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in
relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which
leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve
superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks,
at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing
equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local
context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work
proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a
novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our
method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving
${O}(N \log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method
scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of
the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token
permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We
benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body
simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping
dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU
memory size, speed, and accuracy.

three key challenges: inaccurate activation prediction, PCIe bandwidth
competition, and cross-device scheduling complexity. Our solution includes: 1)
Learnable Layer-Aware Predictor (LLaPor) that captures layer-specific expert
activation patterns; 2) Prefetch-Aware Cross-Layer Scheduling (PreSched) that
generates globally optimal plans balancing prefetching costs and loading
overhead; 3) Asynchronous I/O Optimizer (AsyncIO) that decouples I/O from

Motivation: 现有异构图神经网络模型在捕获长距离信息时效率低下，且容易因堆叠多层导致计算复杂和过平滑问题。

Method: 提出VN-HGCN，利用虚拟节点作为辅助节点，与特定类型节点相连，促进跨节点和边的长距离信息高效聚合。

Result: VN-HGCN在仅4层的情况下实现了高效信息聚合，并在三个真实数据集上优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: VN-HGCN是一种通用框架，可应用于其他HGNN模型，实验验证了其有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) have exhibited powerful
performance in heterogeneous graph learning by aggregating information from
various types of nodes and edges. However, existing heterogeneous graph models
often struggle to capture long-range information or necessitate stacking
numerous layers to learn such dependencies, resulting in high computational
complexity and encountering over-smoothing issues. In this paper, we propose a
Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which
leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the
graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a
specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range
information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual
nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information
aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can
serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN
models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the
effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three
real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our
model over several state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 图神经网络通常假设类别平衡，但实际数据中类别不平衡普遍存在，且随机种子可能导致性能显著下降。

Method: 提出PNS（Pure Node Sampling）模块，直接在节点合成阶段操作，以消除随机因素的影响。

Result: 实验证明PNS能有效消除不利随机种子的影响，并在多个基准数据集上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PNS是一种即插即用的模块，不仅能解决RACP问题，还能缓解节点邻居分布异常导致的性能下降。

Abstract: The problem of class imbalance refers to an uneven distribution of quantity
among classes in a dataset, where some classes are significantly
underrepresented compared to others. Class imbalance is also prevalent in
graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the
assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In
our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness
Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are
affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To
eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure
Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing
approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity
imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that
operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also
alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node
neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are
influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of
unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various
benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones. Data and code are available at

Result: 在ImageNet 256上，FID Score提升20%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法在高维数据重建中表现优异，为离散VAE提供了更高效的训练框架。

Abstract: Discrete latent bottlenecks in variational autoencoders (VAEs) offer high bit
efficiency and can be modeled with autoregressive discrete distributions,
enabling parameter-efficient multimodal search with transformers. However,
discrete random variables do not allow for exact differentiable
parameterization; therefore, discrete VAEs typically rely on approximations,
such as Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization or straight-through gradient
estimates, or employ high-variance gradient-free methods such as REINFORCE that
have had limited success on high-dimensional tasks such as image
reconstruction. Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a
training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a
non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring
reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation
and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as
ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and
quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional
data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for
ImageNet 256.

Abstract: Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of
probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their
prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains
elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and
model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model
predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay
between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly
investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of
post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic
regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds,
and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we
explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance
through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a
diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating
consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By
examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing
only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise
dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability
of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines
for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics
and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical
understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification. Code

Motivation: 解决现有早期退出策略因静态阈值导致的过自信和分布偏移问题，提升模型的可信度和准确性。

Method: 使用多臂老虎机框架在线无监督调整退出阈值，基于新的奖励函数评估预测确定性和可靠性。

Result: 在多种任务上实现1.70-2.10倍的加速，性能下降小于2%。

Conclusion: UAT在保持高性能的同时显著提升计算效率，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Early-Exit Deep Neural Networks enable adaptive inference by allowing
prediction at intermediary layers, significantly reducing computational costs
and latency. Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an
intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined
threshold that is set using a static validation set. This is problematic as the
model might be overconfident in a wrong class. Also, they are not robust to
distribution shifts encountered in deployment, which can undermine model
trustworthiness and accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose UAT that
adapts the threshold for exit decisions using a Multi-Armed Bandit framework,
enabling online, unsupervised adjustment of exit decisions. UAT makes decisions
based on a new reward function that assesses predictive certainty and its
reliability to balance computational efficiency and prediction quality while
penalizing unnecessary late exits. We provide guarantees on risk achieved by
UAT and validate its performance on diverse tasks spanning vision-language
understanding, text generation, and classification. Our framework demonstrates
consistent improvements in speedup (1.70-2.10x) with a minimal performance drop
(<2%) as compared to full model performance. Our source code is available at

TL;DR: 论文指出，传统的知识蒸馏（KD）后对齐（Align）流程会限制模型对罕见但理想行为的对齐能力，提出应先对齐再蒸馏（Align -> KD），并验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在紧凑模型上进行偏好对齐时，忽略了参考模型的分布召回特性，导致对罕见行为的对齐能力下降。

Method: 通过理论分析、可控实验（Mixture-of-Gaussians）和LLM（SmolLM2家族）验证，比较了KD -> Align与Align -> KD的效果。

Result: Align -> KD流程显著提升了目标行为的对齐效果，模型在奖励和目标精度上表现更优且方差更低。

Conclusion: 参考模型的召回特性是对齐设计的关键因素，应先对齐再蒸馏。

Abstract: For efficiency, preference alignment is often performed on compact,
knowledge-distilled (KD) models. We argue this common practice introduces a
significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's
reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD ->
Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable
behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that
reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first
be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions
are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the
reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental
level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians
experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model
performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM
alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively
align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target
precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these
behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower
variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a
first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment
must precede distillation.

Result: 在多个真实股票数据集上的实验表明，Hermes在效率和准确性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Hermes通过改进行业相关性建模，显著提升了股票时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting occurs in a range of financial applications providing
essential decision-making support to investors, regulatory institutions, and
analysts. Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series
exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve
forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only
capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two
key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag
interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among
industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series
forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by
eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and
multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more
flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a
hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding
window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider
lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model
multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message
passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the
consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock
datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有GNN方法忽视邻居信息多样性且依赖单一时间尺度表示，导致信息冗余和预测局限。

Result: 在真实数据集上，DIMIGNN表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DIMIGNN有效解决了信息冗余和多尺度融合问题，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Recently, numerous deep models have been proposed to enhance the performance
of multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Among them, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs)-based methods have shown great potential due to their
capability to explicitly model inter-variable dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook the diversity of information among neighbors, which may
lead to redundant information aggregation. In addition, their final prediction
typically relies solely on the representation from a single temporal scale. To
tackle these issues, we propose a Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with
Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection and Dynamic Multi-scale Fusion (DIMIGNN).
DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to
ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its
neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves. Furthermore,
a Dynamic Multi-Scale Fusion Module (DMFM) is introduced to dynamically adjust
the contributions of prediction results from different temporal scales to the
final forecasting result. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that DIMIGNN consistently outperforms prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集模型的扩展规律不适用于MoE模型，因其影响因素多、耦合关系复杂且性能影响非单调，需要深入研究MoE特有的扩展规律。

Method: 通过分解MoE设置，识别了5个关键因素，设计了446个对照实验，分析了它们的边际效应，构建了联合MoE扩展定律。

Result: 发现最优的G和S设置与模型架构和数据大小无关；随着N的扩展，最优的Na/N比例变得更稀疏。

Conclusion: 提出的MoE扩展定律为未来MoE模型设计和训练提供了准确且深入的指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become the consensus approach for
enabling parameter-efficient scaling and cost-effective deployment in large
language models. However, existing scaling laws for dense models are
inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the
multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and
the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively
necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In
this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying
five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural
perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size
($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)).
Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their
marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE
scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the
theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations
for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that
the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model
architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation
parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could
function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model
design and training.

Conclusion: DCFCL框架有效解决了联邦持续学习中的挑战，提升了模型个性化与性能。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) has garnered increasing attention for its
ability to support distributed computation in environments with evolving data
distributions. However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and
cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most
existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may
not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce
interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly
applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group
formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a
decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish
dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new
knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized
models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective
cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance
gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of
the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition
relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and
model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We
also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution
algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to various
baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/ydn3229/DCFCL.

Conclusion: 通过神经元联盟揭示了特征编码的高阶结构，提供了功能重要、可解释且跨领域预测的计算单元。

Abstract: Fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) encode rich task-specific features,
but the form of these representations, especially within MLP layers, remains
unclear. Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features
concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures
meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may
strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how
neurons work together rather than in isolation.
  We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional
game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences
capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using
top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable
coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We
then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging,
or disappearance.
  Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR
tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than
clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features,
hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and
yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and
predictive across domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像数据因隐私法规无法共享原始数据，而扫描仪导致的域偏移会影响模型在外部站点的表现。现有方法通常违反隐私约束，需要一种隐私友好的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了隐私保护和跨站点泛化的平衡，为医学影像分析提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or
clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical
imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is
scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or
acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most
harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across
sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG)
offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations
without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized
access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets
these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial
Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive
federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method
that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted
3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on
participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79
y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15
sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization
over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究MM对对抗样本迁移性的影响，填补现有研究空白，为设计更安全的系统提供依据。

Method: 综合评估8种MM方法、7个数据集和6种攻击方法，覆盖336种攻击场景，进行统计分析和实验验证。

Result: MM无法可靠防御迁移攻击，95%以上的相对攻击成功率；强MM方法增加脆弱性，权重平均法最脆弱。

Conclusion: 揭示了MM在对抗攻击中的脆弱性，提出了潜在解决方案，为系统设计提供关键见解。

Abstract: Model Merging (MM) has emerged as a promising alternative to multi-task
learning, where multiple fine-tuned models are combined, without access to
tasks' training data, into a single model that maintains performance across
tasks. Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks,
particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored
its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box
adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully
mislead a target model.
  In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial
examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis
consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336
distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion
of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably
defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success
rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners
regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM
methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating
representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight
averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM
method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this
increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our
findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing
MM.

TL;DR: TimeTic是一个用于时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的迁移性估计框架，通过上下文学习预测模型在目标数据集上的微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着TSFMs数量的增加，高效选择适合下游微调的模型变得更具挑战性。TimeTic旨在解决这一问题。

Method: TimeTic将模型选择问题转化为上下文学习任务，利用数据集元特征、模型特性和微调性能的表格结构，并引入基于熵演化的模型表征。

Result: TimeTic在10个数据集、10个基础模型和3个预测任务的基准测试中，与实际微调性能的排名相关性达到0.6，比零样本性能提升30%。

Conclusion: TimeTic能够有效预测模型在未知数据集上的微调性能，为模型选择提供了高效工具。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) offer strong zero-shot forecasting via
large-scale pre-training, yet fine-tuning remains critical for boosting
performance in domains with limited public data. With the growing number of
TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning
becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a
transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an
in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it
predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target)
dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as
contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time
scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset
meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ
tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce
a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers,
capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize
across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for
transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3
forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong
alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets,
achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement
compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.

*Ziheng Cheng,Xin Guo,Yufei Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种连续时间确定性策略梯度方法（CT-DDPG），解决了离散时间算法在连续环境中的稳定性与收敛问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的强化学习应用多为连续时间环境，而传统离散时间算法对时间离散化敏感，导致稳定性差和收敛慢。

Method: 基于优势函数的类比，推导了连续时间策略梯度公式，并建立了其鞅特性，提出了CT-DDPG算法。

Result: 数值实验表明，CT-DDPG在多种控制任务中表现出更好的稳定性和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: CT-DDPG为连续时间环境中的确定性策略学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The theory of discrete-time reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced rapidly
over the past decades. Although primarily designed for discrete environments,
many real-world RL applications are inherently continuous and complex. A major
challenge in extending discrete-time algorithms to continuous-time settings is
their sensitivity to time discretization, often leading to poor stability and
slow convergence. In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient
methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient
formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its
martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed
algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies
in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed
CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to
existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of
control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.

Motivation: 检测支付欺诈需要利用事件顺序和时间间隔，现有模型未能充分结合这两点。

Method: FraudTransformer结合了时间编码器和学习的位置编码器，基于GPT架构改进。

Result: 在工业数据集上，FraudTransformer在AUROC和PRAUC指标上优于传统方法和变体模型。

Conclusion: FraudTransformer通过结合时间和顺序信息，显著提升了欺诈检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting payment fraud in real-world banking streams requires models that
can exploit both the order of events and the irregular time gaps between them.
We introduce FraudTransformer, a sequence model that augments a vanilla
GPT-style architecture with (i) a dedicated time encoder that embeds either
absolute timestamps or inter-event values, and (ii) a learned positional
encoder that preserves relative order. Experiments on a large industrial
dataset -- tens of millions of transactions and auxiliary events -- show that
FraudTransformer surpasses four strong classical baselines (Logistic
Regression, XGBoost and LightGBM) as well as transformer ablations that omit
either the time or positional component. On the held-out test set it delivers
the highest AUROC and PRAUC.

TL;DR: SAFDNet是一种新型的自适应频域网络，用于早期预测术中低血压（IOH），结合了频域特征提取和自适应阈值处理，显著优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中低血压（IOH）与术后并发症密切相关，现有的人工智能模型在时间与频域信息结合、长短期依赖捕捉和噪声处理方面存在不足。

Method: SAFDNet通过自适应频谱块（利用傅里叶分析提取频域特征）和交互注意力块（捕捉长短期依赖）来解决这些问题。

Result: 在两个大规模真实数据集上的验证显示，SAFDNet的AUROC高达97.3%，且对噪声不敏感。

Conclusion: SAFDNet在临床应用中表现出色，具有强大的预测性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) is strongly associated with postoperative
complications, including postoperative delirium and increased mortality, making
its early prediction crucial in perioperative care. While several artificial
intelligence-based models have been developed to provide IOH warnings, existing
methods face limitations in incorporating both time and frequency domain
information, capturing short- and long-term dependencies, and handling noise
sensitivity in biosignal data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet
integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to
extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to
mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to
capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive
internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets
demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\% AUROC in IOH early warning,
outperforming state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SAFDNet exhibits robust
predictive performance and low sensitivity to noise, making it well-suited for
practical clinical applications.

Method: 利用粒度球技术多采样数据，构建多粒度球以逐步揭示数据骨架结构。

Result: GBSK在标准硬件上高效处理大规模数据（如1亿实例），保持高聚类精度。

Conclusion: GBSK及其自适应版本AGBSK在大规模数据聚类中表现出色，适合实际应用。

Abstract: To effectively handle clustering task for large-scale datasets, we propose a
novel scalable skeleton clustering algorithm, namely GBSK, which leverages the
granular-ball technique to capture the underlying structure of data. By
multi-sampling the dataset and constructing multi-grained granular-balls, GBSK
progressively uncovers a statistical "skeleton" -- a spatial abstraction that
approximates the essential structure and distribution of the original data.
This strategy enables GBSK to dramatically reduce computational overhead while
maintaining high clustering accuracy. In addition, we introduce an adaptive
version, AGBSK, with simplified parameter settings to enhance usability and
facilitate deployment in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments conducted
on standard computing hardware demonstrate that GBSK achieves high efficiency
and strong clustering performance on large-scale datasets, including one with
up to 100 million instances across 256 dimensions. Our implementation and
experimental results are available at: https://github.com/XFastDataLab/GBSK/.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种延迟调度机制（DP），用于解决符号音乐生成中效率与质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 符号音乐生成在效率和生成质量之间存在矛盾，细粒度标记化虽能保证连贯性但复杂度高，而紧凑标记化效率高但依赖性强。

Method: 采用延迟调度机制（DP），将复合标记分散到解码步骤中，实现自回归建模的同时保持效率。

Result: 在符号管弦乐MIDI数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于标准复合标记化，并缩小了与细粒度标记化的差距。

Conclusion: DP是一种轻量级策略，无需额外参数，可无缝集成到现有表示中，有效平衡了效率与质量。

Abstract: Symbolic music generation faces a fundamental trade-off between efficiency
and quality. Fine-grained tokenizations achieve strong coherence but incur long
sequences and high complexity, while compact tokenizations improve efficiency
at the expense of intra-token dependencies. To address this, we adapt a
delay-based scheduling mechanism (DP) that expands compound-like tokens across
decoding steps, enabling autoregressive modeling of intra-token dependencies
while preserving efficiency. Notably, DP is a lightweight strategy that
introduces no additional parameters and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing representations. Experiments on symbolic orchestral MIDI datasets show
that our method improves all metrics over standard compound tokenizations and
narrows the gap to fine-grained tokenizations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种适用于深度强化学习的模式感知批量归一化（MA-BN）方法，解决了传统批量归一化（BN）在非独立同分布数据中的挑战，提升了训练稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管批量归一化在深度学习中表现优异，但其在深度强化学习中的应用受限，主要由于数据的非独立同分布性和动态分布变化。论文旨在探索BN在DRL中的潜力。

Method: 通过系统实验分析BN在离策略演员-评论家算法中的表现，提出MA-BN方法，解决不稳定性和发散问题。

Result: MA-BN在RL中加速和稳定训练，扩大有效学习率范围，增强探索能力，降低优化难度。

Conclusion: MA-BN为DRL中的BN集成提供了实用建议，显著提升了训练效果。

Abstract: Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep
learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling
more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data
and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning
process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains
unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and
its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to
evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final
performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use
of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how
different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify
failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying
causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with
practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL
pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates
and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances
exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty. Our code is available

Motivation: 解决DFT在训练中的不稳定性和泛化问题。

Method: 提出ASFT，结合DFT的加权和KL正则化。

Result: 在数学推理、医学知识和代码生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 理论分析指导实践，ASFT兼具理论保证和实际效果。

Abstract: Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off
between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations
but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better
generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently
emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token
probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though
it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through
the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds
to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL
bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical
limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to
progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we
propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's
reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while
ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT
across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code
generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational
overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding
post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis
leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.

TL;DR: SHAPoint是一个新颖的任务无关框架，结合了梯度提升树的预测准确性和基于点的风险评分的可解释性，适用于分类、回归和生存任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统风险评分方法依赖手动预处理和简化假设，限制了灵活性和预测能力。

Method: SHAPoint整合梯度提升树和可解释性风险评分，支持多种任务，并继承树模型的优势（如处理缺失数据和单调约束）。

Result: SHAPoint在预测性能上与最先进方法相当，但运行时间更短，生成紧凑且可解释的评分。

Conclusion: SHAPoint是透明且可扩展的风险分层工具，兼具灵活性和高效性。

Abstract: Interpretable risk scores play a vital role in clinical decision support, yet
traditional methods for deriving such scores often rely on manual
preprocessing, task-specific modeling, and simplified assumptions that limit
their flexibility and predictive power. We present SHAPoint, a novel,
task-agnostic framework that integrates the predictive accuracy of gradient
boosted trees with the interpretability of point-based risk scores. SHAPoint
supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting
valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing
data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks,
SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing,
and faster runtime performance. Empirical results show that SHAPoint produces
compact and interpretable scores with predictive performance comparable to
state-of-the-art methods, but at a fraction of the runtime, making it a
powerful tool for transparent and scalable risk stratification.

Motivation: LLM作为神经知识库的结构化知识组织尚未被充分研究，受认知神经科学启发，探索其知识同质性模式。

Method: 将LLM知识映射为图表示，分析实体间的知识关系，提出GNN回归模型预测实体知识得分。

Conclusion: 基于知识同质性的方法优化了LLM的知识注入和多跳推理问答，为高效知识管理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural
knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as
question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of
their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience
findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact
increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an
analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM
knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the
triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability
relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to
possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the
graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for
triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted
knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets,
thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not
only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject
knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in
reasoning-intensive question answering.

TL;DR: Mamba（一种状态空间模型）在长序列建模中表现出与Transformer竞争的在上下文学习能力，但其理论机制尚不明确。本文通过分析Mamba在线性回归任务中的训练动态，揭示了其独特的在线梯度下降机制。


<details>

Motivation: Mamba作为Transformer的高效替代方案，其上下文学习能力虽被实证研究证实，但理论理解不足，限制了对其机制的深入认识。

Method: 通过开发针对Mamba结构的非凸优化技术，分析其在线性回归任务中的训练动态，并建立指数收敛率和损失边界。

Result: Mamba通过一种不同于Transformer的在线梯度下降机制实现上下文学习，理论结果通过实验验证。

Conclusion: Mamba的上下文学习机制与Transformer不同，其在线梯度下降特性为理解其高效性提供了新视角。

Abstract: State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient
Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling.
Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL)
capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large
foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains
limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even
fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard
theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in
the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of
Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques
tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's
structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and
derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our
results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \textit{online gradient
descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different
from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through
gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by
experimental simulation.

Motivation: 探索Visual CoT在图像噪声下的鲁棒性，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 通过12种图像损坏类型和4个VQA数据集进行系统评估，并提出基于Grounding DINO的增强方法。

Result: Visual CoT提升准确性但增加对噪声的敏感性，Grounding DINO方法有效增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 揭示了Visual CoT的脆弱性，并提出了一种架构无关的解决方案。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced reasoning in
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Extending this paradigm, Visual CoT integrates
explicit visual edits, such as cropping or annotating regions of interest, into
the reasoning process, achieving superior multimodal performance. However, the
robustness of Visual CoT-based VLMs against image-level noise remains
unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of Visual
CoT robustness under visual perturbations. Our benchmark spans 12 image
corruption types across 4 Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets, enabling a
comprehensive comparison between VLMs that use Visual CoT, and VLMs that do
not. The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves
absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted
by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations,
resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through
extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual
CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility.
Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement
method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline,
providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning. Our work
reveals clear fragility patterns in Visual CoT and offers an effective,
architecture-agnostic solution for enhancing visual robustness.

Motivation: 现有转向方法依赖大规模数据集，限制了实际应用；小数据集提取的转向向量常含噪声，效果不佳。

Result: SAE-RSV显著优于基线方法，包括监督微调。

Conclusion: 通过SAE精炼转向向量，可在有限数据下构建有效转向向量。

Abstract: Steering has emerged as a promising approach in controlling large language
models (LLMs) without modifying model parameters. However, most existing
steering methods rely on large-scale datasets to learn clear behavioral
information, which limits their applicability in many real-world scenarios. The
steering vectors extracted from small dataset often contain task-irrelevant
noising features, which degrades their effectiveness. To refine the steering
vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector
via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise
and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove
task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and
then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their
semantic similarity to the identified relevant features. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that the proposed SAE-RSV substantially outperforms all the
baseline methods including supervised fine-tuning. Our findings show that
effective steering vector can be constructed from limited training data by
refining the original steering vector through SAEs.

Result: 实验证明STAIR在多阶段任务中表现优越，且与人类认知一致。

Conclusion: STAIR有效缓解阶段错位，提升多阶段任务的策略学习效果。

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) bypasses complex reward
engineering by learning rewards directly from human preferences, enabling
better alignment with human intentions. However, its effectiveness in
multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g.,
navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments
from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in
uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we
validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and
empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward
learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal
distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance
is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into
coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to
policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in
multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks.
Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are
consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating
stage misalignment.

Conclusion: 代理驱动的FL框架为医疗领域的联邦学习提供了自动化解决方案，但复杂任务的完全自动化仍需进一步研究。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) allows collaborative model training across healthcare
sites without sharing sensitive patient data. However, real-world FL deployment
is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial
human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals),
(b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data
pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across
clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and
cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook
these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks
motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent
agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively
manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this
end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases
of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a
benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to
autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL
algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and
cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of
complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6
modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy,
Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic
performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium,
and large model scales. While some agent cores such as GPT-4.1 and DeepSeek V3
can automate various stages of the FL pipeline, our results reveal that more
complex, interdependent tasks based on implicit goals remain challenging for
even the strongest models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新方法VERL，通过解耦探索与利用，在隐藏状态空间实现协同增强，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RLVR视角将探索与利用视为权衡关系，但作者认为这是测量层面的假象，而非本质约束。

Method: 采用有效秩（ER）及其导数ERV和ERA量化动态，提出VERL方法，通过优势函数直接塑造协同增强。

Result: 在多种LLM和推理基准上表现一致提升，Gaokao 2024数据集准确率绝对提升达21.4%。

Conclusion: 隐藏状态层面的探索与利用可解耦，VERL通过双通道激励结构实现协同增强，突破传统权衡限制。

Abstract: A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation
trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine
this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a
fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To
investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state
space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its
novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV)
and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our
analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation
could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance
both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method,
Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the
principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly
shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the
theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a
synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off,
VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence
and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across
diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to
21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.

TL;DR: Tequila是一种新型的三元量化优化方法，通过将死区边界权重重新用作动态偏置，显著提升了模型性能，几乎匹配全精度性能，同时实现3倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有三元量化方法因死区陷阱问题导致模型性能显著下降，即使经过昂贵的量化感知训练仍无法解决。

Method: 提出Tequila方法，通过重新利用死区边界权重作为动态偏置，使其在前向传播中提供连续信号，并在反向传播中接收有意义的梯度信号。

Result: 在五个基准测试中优于现有三元量化方法，ARC基准上准确率提升>4%，推理速度提升3倍，接近全精度性能（差距<1%）。

Conclusion: Tequila为资源受限环境下部署高级LLM提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on
mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it
not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining
weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with
hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to
significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training
with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large
number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because
these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable
escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization.
To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization
optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing
them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a
continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct,
meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model
capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC
benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly
matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference
speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient
implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained
environments. The code is available at https://github.com/Tencent/AngelSlim.

TL;DR: IndexNet是一个基于MLP的框架，通过索引嵌入模块（IE）利用时间戳和变量索引信息，提升多变量时间序列预测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了时间戳和变量索引等描述性信息，而这些信息具有丰富的上下文语义。IndexNet旨在利用这些信息提升预测能力。

Method: IndexNet包含时间戳嵌入（TE）和通道嵌入（CE）模块，分别处理时间戳和变量索引信息，增强模型的周期捕获能力和变量区分能力。

Result: 在12个真实数据集上的实验表明，IndexNet性能与主流基线相当，同时表现出较强的通用性和可解释性。

Conclusion: IndexNet通过利用索引信息，有效提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能，并填补了当前研究中通用性和可解释性的空白。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) plays a vital role in a wide
range of real-world applications, such as weather prediction and traffic flow
forecasting. Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling
of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods
overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable
indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such
information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture
ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework
augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two
key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE).
Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them
into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture
long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a
unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model
to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized
predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12
diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable
performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our
temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and
visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality
and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF
research.

Motivation: 由于动态图数据分布随时间变化，训练好的DGNN在未见测试图上性能不确定，需要评估其适用性。

Method: DyGEval包括测试时动态图模拟和评估器训练两阶段，捕捉训练-测试分布差异。

Result: 实验表明DyGEval能有效评估不同分布偏移下DGNN的性能。

Conclusion: DyGEval为解决DGNN模型评估问题提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a leading paradigm for
learning from dynamic graphs, which are commonly used to model real-world
systems and applications. However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph
data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant
performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in
practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed
DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is
suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we
introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess
the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by
estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time.
Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed
DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage
framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the
training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an
evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates
the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an
effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different
dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成框架Space Group Conditional Flow Matching，通过结合空间群和Wyckoff位置约束，生成更对称、更稳定的晶体结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型忽略晶体对称性约束，导致生成的结构对称性不足且不稳定。

Method: 通过定义条件对称噪声基分布和群条件等变向量场，限制原子运动到初始Wyckoff位置，并采用高效群平均方法降低计算开销。

Result: 在晶体结构预测和从头生成基准测试中达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了生成晶体的对称性和稳定性，计算开销可忽略。

Abstract: Inorganic crystals are periodic, highly-symmetric arrangements of atoms in
three-dimensional space. Their structures are constrained by the symmetry
operations of a crystallographic \emph{space group} and restricted to lie in
specific affine subspaces known as \emph{Wyckoff positions}. The frequency an
atom appears in the crystal and its rough positioning are determined by its
Wyckoff position. Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates
overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high
populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce
Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that
samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric,
stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process
on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a
conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned,
equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to
their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is
achieved using an efficient reformulation of \emph{group averaging} tailored
for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of
symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on
crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks. We also perform
relevant ablations.

Abstract: We propose $\textbf{E}$lectric $\textbf{C}$urrent $\textbf{D}$iscrete
$\textbf{D}$ata $\textbf{G}$eneration (ECD$^{2}$G), a pioneering method for
data generation in discrete settings that is grounded in electrical engineering
theory. Our approach draws an analogy between electric current flow in a
circuit and the transfer of probability mass between data distributions. We
interpret samples from the source distribution as current input nodes of a
circuit and samples from the target distribution as current output nodes. A
neural network is then used to learn the electric currents to represent the
probability flow in the circuit. To map the source distribution to the target,
we sample from the source and transport these samples along the circuit
pathways according to the learned currents. This process provably guarantees
transfer between data distributions. We present proof-of-concept experiments to
illustrate our ECD$^{2}$G method.

Motivation: 标准确定性路由机制存在脆弱性，导致模型校准不足和过度自信，无法识别未知信息。

Method: 在权重空间、logit空间和选择空间三个阶段引入不确定性，构建贝叶斯MoE路由框架。

Result: 在30亿参数MoE模型上验证，显著提升路由稳定性、校准和OoD检测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建更鲁棒、自知的LLMs提供了实用路径，使其能识别未知信息。

Abstract: The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture has enabled the creation of massive
yet efficient Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the standard deterministic
routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness
is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in
systems that often do not know what they don't know.
  This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured
\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single,
deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution
over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families
of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of
the routing pipeline: in the \textbf{weight-space}, the \textbf{logit-space},
and the final \textbf{selection-space}.
  Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE
model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing
stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD)
detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural
component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work
provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building
more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know
what they don't know.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，AD-RRL表现出优于现有鲁棒RL方法的鲁棒性和性能。

Conclusion: AD-RRL通过扩散模型和CVaR优化，有效提升了RL策略的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Robustness to modeling errors and uncertainties remains a central challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). In this work, we address this challenge by
leveraging diffusion models to train robust RL policies. Diffusion models have
recently gained popularity in model-based RL due to their ability to generate
full trajectories "all at once", mitigating the compounding errors typical of
step-by-step transition models. Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample
from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage
conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in
environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between
Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce
Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides
the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training,
effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return. Empirical results
across standard benchmarks show that AD-RRL achieves superior robustness and
performance compared to existing robust RL methods.

Motivation: 解决VLM-based GUI代理在强化学习中交互慢和数据不足的问题。

Method: 提出DART框架，包含四个异步模块：环境集群、rollout服务、数据管理和训练器，并引入自适应数据管理方案。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，DART-GUI-7B任务成功率提升14.61%，达到42.13%。

Conclusion: DART框架高效且有效，为开源社区提供了强化学习训练的新工具。

Abstract: Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating
complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying
reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI
environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality
agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these
challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI
agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner.
DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment
cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables
non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory
sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the
system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput,
and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from
abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1)
pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement
sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers
and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on
high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning
via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout
and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task
success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than
open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and
model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe
is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.

Motivation: 探讨潜意识学习在硬蒸馏中发生的条件和机制。

Method: 通过控制实验和机制分析，研究潜意识学习的发生方式。

Result: 发现潜意识学习不需要全局标记纠缠或logit泄漏，而是由少数分歧标记驱动。

Conclusion: 潜意识学习脆弱，早期层关键，且可通过简单修改抑制。

Abstract: Language models can transfer hidden biases during distillation. For example,
a teacher that "likes owls" can make its student "like owls" too, even when the
training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is
called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft
distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token
distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where
the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how
does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through
controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that
subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage.
Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where
teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out
these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically,
divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly,
finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal
learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small
changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.

Abstract: A key challenge in modern deep learning theory is to explain the remarkable
success of gradient-based optimization methods when training large-scale,
complex deep neural networks. Though linear convergence of such methods has
been proved for a handful of specific architectures, a united theory still
evades researchers. This article presents a unified proof for linear
convergence of continuous gradient descent, also called gradient flow, while
training any neural network with piecewise non-zero polynomial activations or
ReLU, sigmoid activations. Our primary contribution is a single, general
theorem that not only covers architectures for which this result was previously
unknown but also consolidates existing results under weaker assumptions. While
our focus is theoretical and our results are only exact in the infinitesimal
step size limit, we nevertheless find excellent empirical agreement between the
predictions of our result and those of the practical step-size gradient descent
method.

Result: 在多个持续学习基准测试中表现优于现有方法，显著减少灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: DOC方法为持续微调大语言模型提供了有效的工具。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge in continual learning
for large language models (LLMs), where models struggle to retain performance
on historical tasks when fine-tuning on new sequential data without access to
past datasets. In this paper, we first reveal that the drift of functional
directions during the fine-tuning process is a key reason why existing
regularization-based methods fail in long-term LLM continual learning. To
address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a
novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and
dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by
adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked
historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new
and old tasks. Extensive experiments on various LLM continual learning
benchmarks demonstrate that this approach outperforms prior methods,
effectively reducing catastrophic forgetting and providing a robust tool for
continuous LLM fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Motivation: 传统结构化稀疏正则化因不可微分性无法与随机梯度下降兼容，需要专用优化器或后剪枝，缺乏理论保证。

Method: 通过将每组权重分为主权重向量和多个标量门控因子，实现结构化稀疏的正则化。

Result: 理论证明$D$-Gating与$L_{2,2/D}$正则化等价，实验验证其在多种任务中性能优于直接优化和传统剪枝。

Conclusion: $D$-Gating在理论和实践中均表现出色，提供了一种高效的结构化稀疏优化方案。

Abstract: Structured sparsity regularization offers a principled way to compact neural
networks, but its non-differentiability breaks compatibility with conventional
stochastic gradient descent and requires either specialized optimizers or
additional post-hoc pruning without formal guarantees. In this work, we propose
$D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits
each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating
factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local
minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show
that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the
$L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results
show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group
sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a
non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across
vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers
strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization
of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.

Abstract: The deployment of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm-assisted communication
networks has become an increasingly vital approach for remediating coverage
limitations in infrastructure-deficient environments, with especially pressing
applications in temporary scenarios, such as emergency rescue, military and
security operations, and remote area coverage. However, complex geographic
environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel
conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links
that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV
swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV
swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an
integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent
energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed
to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between
equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy
expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory
control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions
across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a
novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking
(MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action
spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints
in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by
up to 25% compared to baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从稀疏时间序列数据中学习的问题，同时保持模型的解释性和表达能力。

Method: 将时间依赖轨迹表示为有向图，并对每个图应用增强的GNAN，允许用户通过分组特征和图来控制解释性与表达性的权衡。

Result: 在真实数据集（如血液测试的死亡率预测和假新闻检测）上，GMAN优于非解释性黑盒基线，并提供可操作的领域对齐解释。

Conclusion: GMAN在保持高解释性的同时，实现了与黑盒模型相媲美的性能，适用于需要可解释性的应用场景。

Abstract: We introduce GMAN, a flexible, interpretable, and expressive framework that
extends Graph Neural Additive Networks (GNANs) to learn from sets of sparse
time-series data. GMAN represents each time-dependent trajectory as a directed
graph and applies an enriched, more expressive GNAN to each graph. It allows
users to control the interpretability-expressivity trade-off by grouping
features and graphs to encode priors, and it provides feature, node, and
graph-level interpretability. On real-world datasets, including mortality
prediction from blood tests and fake-news detection, GMAN outperforms strong
non-interpretable black-box baselines while delivering actionable,
domain-aligned explanations.

*Zhinan Xie,Peisong Wang,Jian Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HiViS通过显隐式输入分解框架，有效加速视觉语言模型的推理速度，保持生成质量无损。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型中视觉令牌导致的语义偏差和解码速度下降问题。

Method: 采用显隐式输入分解框架，移除视觉令牌，复用目标模型的隐藏状态，并引入多步自反馈训练策略。

Result: 将预填充序列长度压缩至目标模型的0.7%-1.3%，实现2.65倍加速。

Conclusion: HiViS在加速视觉语言模型推理方面表现出色，适用于多种任务和模型。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is an effective approach for accelerating inference in
Large Language models (LLMs), but its adaptation to Vision-Language models
(VLMs) remains challenging for additional visual tokens in multimodal inputs.
First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from
different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target
VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the
KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens
substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding
stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative
Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input
decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual
tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as
explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding
last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional
processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step
self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential
embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach
compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the
target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive
experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup,
confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.

TL;DR: 本文通过内部指标MUI研究了MoE架构的机制，揭示了模型演化、训练动态、专家协作和神经元激活模式的新发现。


<details>

Motivation: 当前MoE研究主要集中在性能上，对其内部机制理解有限，限制了进一步的发展。

Method: 通过引入路由机制和分析专家级行为，系统研究了多种公开MoE模型。

Result: 发现神经元利用率随模型演化下降、训练动态轨迹、专家协作完成任务、神经元激活模式反映数据多样性。

Conclusion: MUI可作为基准性能的补充指标，为MoE模型的容量、动态和专业化提供新见解。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising direction,
offering efficiency and scalability by activating only a subset of parameters
during inference. However, current research remains largely
performance-centric, with limited understanding of its internal mechanisms,
thereby constraining broader progress. In this work, we use an internal metric
to investigate the mechanisms of MoE architecture by explicitly incorporating
routing mechanisms and analyzing expert-level behaviors. Through systematic
analyses of a wide range of publicly available MoE models, we uncover several
findings: (1) neuron utilization decreases as models evolve, reflecting
stronger generalization; (2) training exhibits a dynamic trajectory, where
benchmark performance alone provides limited signal while MUI reveals deeper
insights; (3) task completion emerges from collaborative contributions of
multiple experts, with shared experts driving concentration; and (4) activation
patterns at the neuron level provide a fine-grained proxy for data diversity.
Together, these results demonstrate the potential of MUI as a complementary
indicator to benchmark performance, offering new insights into the capacity,
dynamics, and specialization of MoE models. Our project can be found at

Result: 发现扩散模型通过互信息绑定信号与条件信息，分类器自由引导有效提升互信息，尤其适用于图像模型。

Conclusion: 扩散模型与凯利准则的联系揭示了互信息的重要性，分类器自由引导在图像模型中效果显著，同时修正了扩散模型作为无限深度自编码器的观点。

Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for
maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models
store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning
information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free
guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at
sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual
information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately
connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the
popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In
doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum
mechanics.

Result: CorText能生成准确的图像描述，并在零样本泛化中表现优于对照组。

Conclusion: CorText标志着从被动解码向生成性、灵活脑活动-语言接口的转变。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized human-machine interaction,
and have been extended by embedding diverse modalities such as images into a
shared language space. Yet, neural decoding has remained constrained by static,
non-interactive methods. We introduce CorText, a framework that integrates
neural activity directly into the latent space of an LLM, enabling open-ended,
natural language interaction with brain data. Trained on fMRI data recorded
during viewing of natural scenes, CorText generates accurate image captions and
can answer more detailed questions better than controls, while having access to
neural data only. We showcase that CorText achieves zero-shot generalization
beyond semantic categories seen during training. Furthermore, we present a
counterfactual analysis that emulates in-silico cortical microstimulation.
These advances mark a shift from passive decoding toward generative, flexible
interfaces between brain activity and language.

Motivation: 尽管Shapely 2.0和Triton等工具提升了空间相似性计算的效率，但在处理极大数据集时仍面临计算量过大的挑战。

Method: 结合动态相似性索引阈值、监督调度和召回约束优化，利用KDE动态确定相似性阈值，并通过机器学习模型优先处理聚类。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算成本，适用于大规模地理空间分析。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模地理空间分析提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Advancements in tools like Shapely 2.0 and Triton can significantly improve
the efficiency of spatial similarity computations by enabling faster and more
scalable geometric operations. However, for extremely large datasets, these
optimizations may face challenges due to the sheer volume of computations
required. To address this, we propose a framework that reduces the number of
clusters requiring verification, thereby decreasing the computational load on
these systems. The framework integrates dynamic similarity index thresholding,
supervised scheduling, and recall-constrained optimization to efficiently
identify clusters with the highest spatial similarity while meeting
user-defined precision and recall requirements. By leveraging Kernel Density
Estimation (KDE) to dynamically determine similarity thresholds and machine
learning models to prioritize clusters, our approach achieves substantial
reductions in computational cost without sacrificing accuracy. Experimental
results demonstrate the scalability and effectiveness of the method, offering a
practical solution for large-scale geospatial analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$)的结构化推理框架，通过将推理分为探索和执行两个阶段，解决了现有方法的计算效率低、推理路径探索有限和可解释性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Chain-of-Thought (CoT)及其变体在推理能力上虽有进步，但其单一的自回归架构混淆了高层策略规划和低层逐步执行，导致效率低下和可解释性不足。

Method: 提出$E^2C$框架，分为探索阶段（生成高层计划）和执行阶段（执行计划），采用两阶段训练方法（SFT和RL）。

Result: 在AIME'2024上，$E^2C$仅用<10%的解码token达到58.1%准确率；在医疗基准测试中，EF-SFT仅用3.5%的token比标准SFT高14.5%准确率。

Conclusion: $E^2C$通过分离规划与执行，实现了高效推理、强泛化能力和更高可解释性，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning
abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and
auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning
with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency,
limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To
overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a
structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct
phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level
plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the
chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation
algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement
Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and
reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient
test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches
58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods
(e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For
cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with
only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher
accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art
performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating
planning from execution. The code and pre-trained models for the project are

TL;DR: DiBS-MTL是一种基于方向性谈判解决方案的多任务学习方法，解决了任务损失非仿射变换导致的训练不平衡问题，并在非凸任务中证明了收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中，任务损失的任意非仿射变换可能导致某些任务主导训练，影响整体性能。DiBS方法因其对单调非仿射变换的不变性，能够避免这一问题。

Method: 提出DiBS-MTL，将DiBS方法高效地应用于多任务学习，并证明其在非凸任务中的收敛性。

Result: 实验表明，DiBS-MTL在标准多任务学习基准上表现优异，且对非仿射变换具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DiBS-MTL是一种高效且鲁棒的多任务学习方法，适用于非凸任务场景。

Abstract: Multitask learning (MTL) algorithms typically rely on schemes that combine
different task losses or their gradients through weighted averaging. These
methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require
access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central
challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled
relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade
overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the
Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions
immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task
loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex
MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under
standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto
stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL,
a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we
validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it
achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while
maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that
significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior
bargaining-inspired MTL methods. Code available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hoffman et al (2022)的Chinchilla论文提出了计算最优缩放原则，但后续对其可靠性提出了质疑。本文通过分析模型参数的模糊性及其对结果的影响，证实了Chinchilla的关键结论仍可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证Chinchilla论文的可靠性，解决对其模型参数模糊性和结果影响的质疑。

Method: 分析模型参数的三种可能解释，并通过四种结构化扰动测试关键结果的鲁棒性。

Result: 模型参数的解释差异不影响关键结果（缩放定律估计和计算最优标记-参数比），且Chinchilla结论对扰动具有较强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Chinchilla的关键结论仍可作为语言模型缩放的可靠指南。

Abstract: Hoffman et al (2022)'s Chinchilla paper introduced the principle of
compute-optimal scaling, laying a foundation for future scaling of language
models. In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been
raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches,
and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for
the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work
demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model
parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three
interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different
interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps
surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not
meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the
compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation,
the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute
budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have
been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing
model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results
are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the
otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall,
Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our
findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide
for scaling language models.

Abstract: Label noise in datasets could damage the performance of neural net training.
As the size of modern deep networks grows, there is a growing demand for
automated tools for detecting such errors. In this paper, we propose post-hoc,
model-agnostic error detection and rectification methods utilizing the
penultimate feature from a neural network. Our idea is based on the observation
that the similarity between the penultimate feature of a mislabeled data point
and its true class data points is higher than that for data points from other
classes, making the probability of label occurrence within a tight, similar
cluster informative for detecting and rectifying errors. Extensive experiments
show our method not only demonstrates high performance across various noises
but also automatically rectifies these errors to improve the quality of
datasets.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动合成可靠且经济可持续的智能合约提供了可行方案，弥合了高级金融协议与高效链上执行之间的差距。

Abstract: Smart contract-based automation of financial derivatives offers substantial
efficiency gains, but its real-world adoption is constrained by the complexity
of translating financial specifications into gas-efficient executable code. In
particular, generating code that is both functionally correct and economically
viable from high-level specifications, such as the Common Domain Model (CDM),
remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart
contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a
pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum
first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to
gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate
contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to
35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines. This work
presents a viable methodology for the automated synthesis of reliable and
economically sustainable smart contracts, bridging the gap between high-level
financial agreements and efficient on-chain execution.

Motivation: 传统因果发现方法（如PC、GES、ICA-LiNGAM）在可扩展性、计算效率和混合数据类型适应性方面存在局限。

Method: GUIDE采用双编码器架构，结合LLM生成的邻接矩阵和观测数据，并通过强化学习代理动态平衡奖励（准确性）和惩罚（DAG约束）。

Result: GUIDE平均减少42%的运行时间，并在准确性上比NOTEARS和GraN-DAG分别提升约117%。

Conclusion: GUIDE在混合数据类型和大规模节点（≥70）场景下表现优异，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Modern causal discovery methods face critical limitations in scalability,
computational efficiency, and adaptability to mixed data types, as evidenced by
benchmarks on node scalability (30, $\le 50$, $\ge 70$ nodes), computational
energy demands, and continuous/non-continuous data handling. While traditional
algorithms like PC, GES, and ICA-LiNGAM struggle with these challenges,
exhibiting prohibitive energy costs for higher-order nodes and poor scalability
beyond 70 nodes, we propose \textbf{GUIDE}, a framework that integrates Large
Language Model (LLM)-generated adjacency matrices with observational data
through a dual-encoder architecture. GUIDE uniquely optimizes computational
efficiency, reducing runtime on average by $\approx 42%$ compared to RL-BIC and
KCRL methods, while achieving an average $\approx 117%$ improvement in accuracy
over both NOTEARS and GraN-DAG individually. During training, GUIDE's
reinforcement learning agent dynamically balances reward maximization
(accuracy) and penalty avoidance (DAG constraints), enabling robust performance
across mixed data types and scalability to $\ge 70$ nodes -- a setting where
baseline methods fail.

Motivation: 研究在虚假相关性场景下，W2S泛化的理论机制和算法改进，以解决因组不平衡导致的W2S失败问题。

Method: 理论分析了组不平衡对W2S的影响，并提出了一种基于高置信度数据子集重新训练学生的算法。

Result: 实验表明，当伪标签的组不平衡与标记数据一致时W2S成功，否则可能失败；提出的算法显著提升了W2S性能。

Conclusion: W2S在特定条件下有效，但组不平衡可能导致失败；提出的无组标签算法能显著改进性能。

Abstract: We initiate a unified theoretical and algorithmic study of a key problem in
weak-to-strong (W2S) generalization: when fine-tuning a strong pre-trained
student with pseudolabels from a weaker teacher on a downstream task with
spurious correlations, does W2S happen, and how to improve it upon failures? We
consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a
weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group
of fraction $\eta_\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set
pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\eta_u$.
Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional
asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels
when $\eta_u = \eta_\ell$ but may fail when $\eta_u \ne \eta_\ell$, where W2S
gain diminishes as $(\eta_u - \eta_\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is
corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation
benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures,
we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the
strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our
algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements
over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.

Motivation: 视频生成中，注意力延迟是主要瓶颈，传统注意力计算复杂度高。

Method: SLA将注意力权重分为关键、边缘和可忽略三类，分别应用不同计算策略，并集成到单一GPU内核中。

Result: SLA减少95%注意力计算，实现20倍加速，视频生成速度提升2.2倍。

Conclusion: SLA是一种高效且可训练的注意力方法，显著提升扩散模型性能。

Abstract: In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation,
attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the
quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two
parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining
weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse
acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based
on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable
attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion
models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and
negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N)
attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these
computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward
passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x
reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration
without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention
computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality,
outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU
kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a
2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.

Conclusion: 本文为研究人员提供了预测生成式性能的框架和方法，揭示了不同缩放规律的适用场景和局限性。

Abstract: Neural scaling laws have played a central role in modern machine learning,
driving the field's ever-expanding scaling of parameters, data and compute.
While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting
performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as
multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done
on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations
such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and
evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on
generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive
model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in
the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log
likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1)
We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting,
$k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the
predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find
that the compute scaling law and parameters\,+\,tokens scaling law stabilize
for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference
likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In
terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform
comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small
$k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse
for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute
scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the
parameters-and-tokens scaling law. Our framework provides researchers and
practitioners with insights and methodologies to forecast generative

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GPS-MTM是一种基于Transformer的轨迹建模基础模型，通过分解移动数据为状态和动作模态，利用自监督掩码建模学习语义关联，在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将轨迹数据扁平化为坐标流，缺乏对移动语义的理解。GPS-MTM旨在通过分解模态和自监督学习，捕捉人类移动的正常模式。

Method: GPS-MTM将移动数据分解为状态（兴趣点类别）和动作（代理转移），使用双向Transformer和掩码建模目标重建缺失片段。

Result: 在Numosim-LA、Urban Anomalies和Geolife数据集上，GPS-MTM在轨迹填充和下一站预测等任务中表现优于现有方法，尤其在动态任务中优势显著。

Conclusion: GPS-MTM为轨迹分析提供了强大的基础模型，将移动数据提升为大规模表示学习的一流模态。

Abstract: Foundation models have driven remarkable progress in text, vision, and video
understanding, and are now poised to unlock similar breakthroughs in trajectory
modeling. We introduce the GPSMasked Trajectory Transformer (GPS-MTM), a
foundation model for large-scale mobility data that captures patterns of
normalcy in human movement. Unlike prior approaches that flatten trajectories
into coordinate streams, GPS-MTM decomposes mobility into two complementary
modalities: states (point-of-interest categories) and actions (agent
transitions). Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised
masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across
modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual
labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and
Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as
trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most
pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual
reasoning is critical. These results establish GPS-MTM as a robust foundation
model for trajectory analytics, positioning mobility data as a first-class
modality for large-scale representation learning. Code is released for further
reference.

*Runyu Zhang,Na Li,Asuman Ozdaglar,Jeff Shamma,Gioele Zardini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于凸风险度量的风险寻求乐观框架，用于多智能体强化学习（MARL），通过乐观价值函数和政策梯度理论提升合作效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MARL方法多关注风险规避，可能导致次优均衡，而乐观方法虽有效但缺乏理论支持。

Method: 提出乐观价值函数，结合分歧惩罚的风险寻求评估，并开发分散式乐观actor-critic算法。

Result: 实验表明，风险寻求乐观方法在合作任务中优于风险中性基准和启发式乐观方法。

Conclusion: 框架统一了风险敏感学习和乐观主义，为MARL合作提供了理论和实践支持。

Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL),
where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to
model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL
(MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness
to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to
suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can
promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice,
are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual
representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that
interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value
functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking
evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem
for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic
risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic
algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative
benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves
coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods.
Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a
theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in
MARL.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基线，接近全云LLM性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了设备-云协作中的路由问题，提升了整体性能。

Abstract: Device-cloud collaboration has emerged as a promising paradigm for deploying
large language models (LLMs), combining the efficiency of lightweight on-device
inference with the superior performance of powerful cloud LLMs. An essential
problem in this scenario lies in deciding whether a given query is best handled
locally or delegated to the cloud. Existing approaches typically rely on
external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to
determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these
limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing
decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled
through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization
problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem
solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we
develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level
policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the
reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on
cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that
the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and
significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.

Result: CAVs的方差随样本数量N的增加以1/N的速度减小。

Conclusion: 基于理论分析，提出了资源高效应用CAVs的实用建议。

Abstract: One of the most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence is to make
models more transparent to their users. Recently, explainable artificial
intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A
promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level
concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of
methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one
of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their
computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the
actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness
of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis
of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results,
confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an
universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the
number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for
a resource-efficient application of the method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一全局Q函数，难以捕捉涉及多样子任务的任务组合性质。

Result: 在厨房任务中性能提升16.4%，在Gym和Adroit任务中分别提升8.6%和6.3%。

Conclusion: ICQL展示了上下文学习在鲁棒和组合价值估计中的潜力，是一种有效的离线RL框架。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the Q-function is a central challenge in offline
reinforcement learning. However, existing approaches often rely on a single
global Q-function, which struggles to capture the compositional nature of tasks
involving diverse subtasks. We propose In-context Compositional Q-Learning
(\texttt{ICQL}), the first offline RL framework that formulates Q-learning as a
contextual inference problem, using linear Transformers to adaptively infer
local Q-functions from retrieved transitions without explicit subtask labels.
Theoretically, we show that under two assumptions--linear approximability of
the local Q-function and accurate weight inference from retrieved
context--\texttt{ICQL} achieves bounded Q-function approximation error, and
supports near-optimal policy extraction. Empirically, \texttt{ICQL}
substantially improves performance in offline settings: improving performance
in kitchen tasks by up to 16.4\%, and in Gym and Adroit tasks by up to 8.6\%
and 6.3\%. These results highlight the underexplored potential of in-context
learning for robust and compositional value estimation, positioning
\texttt{ICQL} as a principled and effective framework for offline RL.

Conclusion: 计划将SMM扩展到SCT的长期研究目标，为LLM代理的数学推理能力提供基础。

Abstract: Strategy Choice Theory (SCT)\footnote{``Strategy Choice Theory'',
``Distributions of Associations'', and ``Overlapping Wave Theory'' have been
used to refer to this line of work, emphasizing different
aspects.}\citep[e.g.,][]{siegler1984strategychoices, siegler2000rebirth}
explains important aspects of children's arithmetic learning based upon
principles including learning from developmentally naturalistic data,
probabilistic representation, confidence-based retrieval, and the phase-like
importance of scaffolding strategies, such as finger-counting. Here we recast
SCT as a ``Small Math Model'' (SMM), employing a neural-network-based
architecture analogous to LLMs. The SMM extends SCT to include counting
practice\footnote{The original SCT model was pre-biased in accordance with the
supposed experience of counting.}, symbol (number) embedding, and gated
attention. Similar to earlier work, the SMM demonstrates constructive and
destructive interference between counting and addition, and the ``wave-like''
use of finger-counting as sum recall improves. We plan to extend the SMM to
later aspects of the decades-long SCT program, including adaptive strategy
choice and eventually strategy discovery, providing a unified platform to
investigate the understanding of numerical characteristics and relationships
essential for mathematical reasoning -- as it can emerge in LLM-based agents.

TL;DR: AQUAIR是一个公开数据集，记录了摩洛哥一个水产养殖设施的六种室内环境质量变量，填补了智能水产信息学的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能水产系统需要丰富的环境数据流，但公开的室内环境数据集稀缺，限制了预测和异常检测工具的开发。

Method: 使用Awair HOME监测器每五分钟采样一次，记录六种IEQ变量，并进行质量控制和处理。

Result: 数据集包含23,000多个时间戳观测值，展示了稳定的环境条件和喂食时的高峰。

Conclusion: AQUAIR填补了智能水产信息学的空白，为机器学习和环境传感研究提供了可复现的基准。

Abstract: Smart aquaculture systems depend on rich environmental data streams to
protect fish welfare, optimize feeding, and reduce energy use. Yet public
datasets that describe the air surrounding indoor tanks remain scarce, limiting
the development of forecasting and anomaly-detection tools that couple
head-space conditions with water-quality dynamics. We therefore introduce
AQUAIR, an open-access public dataset that logs six Indoor Environmental
Quality (IEQ) variables--air temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide,
total volatile organic compounds, PM2.5 and PM10--inside a fish aquaculture
facility in Amghass, Azrou, Morocco. A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every
five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000
time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly
archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting
height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source
processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and
exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions
(median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time
peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection,
and sensor drift studies. AQUAIR thus fills a critical gap in smart aquaculture
informatics and provides a reproducible benchmark for data-centric machine
learning curricula and environmental sensing research focused on head-space
dynamics in recirculating aquaculture systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合了MDN和对比成本，提升了密度近似能力。

Abstract: Pairwise distance-based costs are crucial for self-supervised and contrastive
feature learning. Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are a widely used approach
for generative models and density approximation, using neural networks to
produce multiple centers that define a Gaussian mixture. By combining MDNs with
contrastive costs, this paper proposes data density approximation using four
types of kernelized matrix costs: the scalar cost, the vector-matrix cost, the
matrix-matrix cost (the trace of Schur complement), and the SVD cost (the
nuclear norm), for learning multiple centers required to define a mixture
density.

Motivation: 机器学习算法在社会领域应用时可能对某些群体产生偏见，现有公平性方法（如基于均等的公平性）可能牺牲模型准确性。偏好公平性虽能提高准确性，但依赖已知人口统计信息。本文旨在解决这一限制。

Method: 提出DAFH算法，联合学习分组分类器和解耦分类器，无需依赖已知人口统计信息。

Conclusion: DAFH算法在无需人口统计信息的条件下实现了公平性与高准确性的平衡，为高风险领域提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains
to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these
algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions
of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of
ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is
\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or
outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness
often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many
high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of
research focuses on \textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group
of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer
the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various
sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic
information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we
relax this requirement and propose a novel \textit{demographic-agnostic
fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a
group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set
of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we
conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the
baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled
classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed
method.

Result: 在合成场景中，PEARL优于启发式和紧凑模型基线，节能达16%。

Conclusion: PEARL展示了LLM在设备端跨层控制中的实用性。

Abstract: We present PEARL (Peer-Enhanced Adaptive Radio via On-Device LLM), a
framework for cooperative cross-layer optimization in device-to-device (D2D)
communication. Building on our previous work on single-device on-device LLMs,
PEARL extends the paradigm by leveraging both publisher and subscriber states
to guide Wi-Fi Aware (WA) parameter selection. A context-aware reward, which
normalizes latency by application tolerances and modulates energy by device
battery states, provides richer supervision for KL-based finetuning. We study
two lightweight variants: PEARL (Head + Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)) achieves
the best overall performance, while PEARL-Lite (Head-only) delivers sub-20 ms
inference at near-identical objective scores. Across synthetic scenarios
grounded in real measurements, PEARL improves objective scores over heuristic
and compact model baselines and reduces energy by up to 16% in cooperative
low-battery cases. These results demonstrate that peer-aware context,
reward-aligned training, and head-based efficiency make LLMs practical for
always-on, on-device cross-layer control.

Result: 在硅点缺陷数据集上，ADAPT比现有GNN模型降低约33%的力和能量预测误差，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: ADAPT为点缺陷模拟提供了一种高效且准确的机器学习力场解决方案。

Abstract: Point defects play a central role in driving the properties of materials.
First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and
structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases. However,
these methods are computationally expensive, making machine-learning force
fields (MLFFs) an attractive alternative for accelerating structural
relaxations. Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs),
which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range
interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling
point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep
Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph
representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly
considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a
Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of
silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both
force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based
model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.

Conclusion: GeoFunFlow为复杂几何逆问题提供了一种高效、可扩展且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) are
crucial in science and engineering. They are particularly challenging due to
ill-posedness, data sparsity, and the added complexity of irregular geometries.
Classical PDE-constrained optimization methods are computationally expensive,
especially when repeated posterior sampling is required. Learning-based
approaches improve efficiency and scalability, yet most are designed for
regular domains or focus on forward modeling. Here, we introduce {\em
GeoFunFlow}, a geometric diffusion model framework for inverse problems on
complex geometries. GeoFunFlow combines a novel geometric function autoencoder
(GeoFAE) and a latent diffusion model trained via rectified flow. GeoFAE
employs a Perceiver module to process unstructured meshes of varying sizes and
produces continuous reconstructions of physical fields, while the diffusion
model enables posterior sampling from sparse and noisy data. Across five
benchmarks, GeoFunFlow achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy over
complex geometries, provides calibrated uncertainty quantification, and
delivers efficient inference compared to operator-learning and diffusion model
baselines.

Motivation: EHR数据具有复杂性、稀疏性和缺失值，传统深度学习方法难以高效处理；Transformer模型虽有效但计算复杂度高，而SSMs（如Mamba）在通道级数据处理上不足。

Method: 提出HyMaTE模型，结合SSMs的线性时间序列建模和Transformer的注意力机制，用于EHR数据的表示学习。

Result: 在多个临床数据集上验证了HyMaTE的有效性，能够生成更丰富和细致的EHR数据表示。

Conclusion: HyMaTE是一种可扩展且通用的解决方案，适用于实际医疗应用，同时具有可解释性。

Abstract: Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day
healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient
health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate
sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in
traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have
demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes,
their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder
their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space
Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time
sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but
focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level
data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and
Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model
tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs
with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on
multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an
effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data.
Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention
illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable
solution for real-world healthcare applications. Codes are available at:

Result: 在五个基准测试中，EFNs训练速度提升4倍，模型大小减少3倍，预测误差降低20%。

Conclusion: EFNs框架在时间序列预测中实现了新的最优性能，尤其在长序列处理上表现突出。

Abstract: At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge:
how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal
dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought
notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between
computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information
over extended horizons.
  Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have
recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant
memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This
makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event
history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art
performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both
their expressiveness and stability.
  We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of
extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel
Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex,
neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's
representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In
addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history
dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon
memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability.
  Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to
4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like
PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative
improvement. One instantiation of our framework, EchoFormer, consistently
achieves new state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets: ETTh,
ETTm, DMV, Weather, and Air Quality.

Conclusion: 逆排列学习的限制揭示了仅解码器Transformer的表达能力差距，并提出了可能的推理机制。

Abstract: In this technical note, we study the problem of inverse permutation learning
in decoder-only transformers. Given a permutation and a string to which that
permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original
(``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness
property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval,
multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an
impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer
cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of
decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample
complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse
permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental
role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity
of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture.
The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input
with ``scratch tokens" yields a construction under which inverse permutation
learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative
mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate
``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when
these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of
intermediate computations).

Abstract: The problem of classification in machine learning has often been approached
in terms of function approximation. In this paper, we propose an alternative
approach for classification in arbitrary compact metric spaces which, in
theory, yields both the number of classes, and a perfect classification using a
minimal number of queried labels. Our approach uses localized trigonometric
polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation
problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the
various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized
kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to
separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical
manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class
boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life
datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a
document dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数值天气预报模型计算量大且易受大气系统混沌性影响，机器学习方法可提供更高效、准确的预测。

Method: 使用时间序列数据，开发两阶段ML流程：回归模型预测台风特征，分类模型预测状态。评估了梯度提升回归和三种分类器（RF、SVM、MLP）。

Result: RF分类器表现最佳（93%准确率），回归预测误差低（气压误差2.2 mb，风速误差2.4 kt）。

Conclusion: ML模型（尤其是集成分类器）是传统预测方法的有效替代方案，适用于实时预测和决策支持系统。

Abstract: Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life,
infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather
prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to
error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a
machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and
status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including
recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a
regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum
pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of
historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to
predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and
three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and
multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and
synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest
performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision,
recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying
minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results
yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about
2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models,
especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative
to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone
prediction and integration into decision support systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的参数高效方法（Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning），通过限制MLP适配器的权重动态，解决了梯度差异方法在LLM中导致的不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型（LLM）遗忘方法（如梯度差异方法）在交叉熵损失下会导致权重和梯度的无界增长，引发训练不稳定，影响遗忘和保留效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于LoRA的微调方法，通过应用有界函数到MLP适配器，控制权重动态，使梯度差异方法能够可靠收敛。

Result: 在TOFU、TDEC和MUSE基准测试中，该方法在不同规模和架构的LLM（125M到8B参数）中显著提升了遗忘效果，同时保持了保留性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM中的遗忘问题提供了一个理论支持且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy
and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A
widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent
on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data
whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy
loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading
to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide
a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how
ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP
layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient
Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based
fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple
modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient
difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE
benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our
method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving
retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable
framework for unlearning in LLMs.

Motivation: 高维数据通常由低维流形生成，但现有自编码器设计难以同时保留全局和局部几何结构。

Method: 提出MAE，采用非对称架构，编码器应用全局距离约束，解码器应用局部几何约束。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，MAE在合成流形和真实数据集上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAE通过非对称设计有效解决了自编码器中几何结构保留的挑战。

Abstract: Autoencoders have emerged as powerful models for visualization and
dimensionality reduction based on the fundamental assumption that
high-dimensional data is generated from a low-dimensional manifold. A critical
challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data
in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either
global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often
encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods
frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale
relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which
introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales
of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the
encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical
analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the
distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive
experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate
that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation
metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法需要模型参数或产生启发式分数，缺乏原则性阈值，限制了应用。

Method: RSP通过随机选择任务优化前缀，并评估其在目标模型上的可转移性，生成p值。

Result: 实验表明，RSP能准确区分相关和不相关模型，p值表现稳健。

Conclusion: RSP是首个原则性统计框架，适用于现代机器学习生态中的模型相关性检测。

Abstract: The growing prevalence of large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs) has heightened the need for reliable techniques to determine
whether a model has been fine-tuned from or is even identical to another.
Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or
produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their
applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a
hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a
statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model
for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target
model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To
mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to
filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and
VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models.
Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently
yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for
unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness
of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general
statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and
interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冻结步态（FoG）严重影响帕金森病患者的行动能力，现有检测系统需要大量患者特定数据且泛化能力不足。

Method: 结合自监督预训练和传感器上下文集成，通过轻量级CNN-LSTM活动分类器选择性激活基础模型。

Result: 在23名帕金森病患者的数据集上，FM-FoG的F1分数达到98.5%，电池续航提升72%。

Conclusion: FM-FoG可实现无需个体化训练、高效节能的医疗应用。

Abstract: Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's
disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence
and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where
walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing
or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection
systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack
generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23
PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen
patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on
a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72%
while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our
FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that
generalize across patients without individual training requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Wasserstein神经元在语言模型中的独特作用，尤其是其对语法行为的贡献。

Method: 通过靶向移除和干预实验，分析Wasserstein神经元对模型功能的影响。

Result: 负预激活空间对语法功能至关重要，移除这些神经元会显著削弱模型性能。

Conclusion: Wasserstein神经元的负分化机制是语言模型依赖语法功能的关键。

Abstract: A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein
neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite
constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal
collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating
similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding
smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative
pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are
driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic
tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region
is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal,
sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a
small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function
and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched
controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech
analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and
layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate
across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical
behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results
identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a
crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的离策略RL提供了新的理论支持和实践指导，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) is
attracting growing interest, driven by practical constraints in real-world
applications, the complexity of LLM-RL infrastructure, and the need for further
innovations of RL methodologies. While classic REINFORCE and its modern
variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded
as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in
this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without
assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native
off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for
adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and
actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths
about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and
reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and
Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss,
and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting
strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with
extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled
algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is

Motivation: 当前抑郁症诊断依赖主观评估且缺乏多模态信息整合能力，LLM虽有望提升诊断准确性，但面临可解释性和数据依赖等挑战。

Method: 开发MDD-Thinker框架，结合监督微调和强化学习，利用UK Biobank和公开数据集生成推理样本，评估其性能。

Result: MDD-Thinker在准确性和F1分数上显著优于传统方法和通用LLM，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: MDD-Thinker为抑郁症诊断提供了可靠且可扩展的解决方案，展示了推理增强LLM在心理健康领域的潜力。

Abstract: Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global
disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective
assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information.
Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy
through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability,
hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data.
  Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that
integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to
strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank
dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000
samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was
fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning
performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and
state-of-the-art LLM baselines.
  Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081,
significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well
as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest
improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and
34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance
compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency.
  Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework
for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By
integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and
efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric
diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide
clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader
applications in mental health care.

Motivation: 解决Adam优化器在LLM预训练中存在的谱条件差和低秩结构问题，同时保留其坐标自适应优势。

Method: 通过将更新投影到正交子空间并应用列归一化，结合全局谱归一化和坐标自适应。

Result: 在LLaMA和GPT-2系列上，Conda比AdamW快2~2.5倍，且表现更稳定。

Conclusion: Conda是一种高效且广泛适用于大规模LLM训练的优化器。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and
emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive
and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast
convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal
that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank
structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral
normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we
propose \textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges
the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal
subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the
projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and
maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral
pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive
experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently
outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on
the LLaMA series, \textbf{Conda achieves $2{\sim}2.5\times$ the convergence
speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further
ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These
results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable
optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on

Conclusion: 耦合SDEs是一种简单而强大的工具，适用于可控生成AI。

Abstract: Editing the content of an image with a pretrained text-to-image model remains
challenging. Existing methods often distort fine details or introduce
unintended artifacts. We propose using coupled stochastic differential
equations (coupled SDEs) to guide the sampling process of any pre-trained
generative model that can be sampled by solving an SDE, including diffusion and
rectified flow models. By driving both the source image and the edited image
with the same correlated noise, our approach steers new samples toward the
desired semantics while preserving visual similarity to the source. The method
works out-of-the-box-without retraining or auxiliary networks-and achieves high
prompt fidelity along with near-pixel-level consistency. These results position
coupled SDEs as a simple yet powerful tool for controlled generative AI.

Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) is critical for industrial

ML model lifecycle from the production environment. Our solution delivers the
analytical power of ML to domain experts through a lightweight, browser-based
interface, eliminating the need for local hardware upgrades and ensuring model

approach empowers experts with interactive control over model parameters,
fostering trust and facilitating seamless integration into existing workflows.
By mitigating the primary financial and operational risks, this framework
offers a scalable and accessible pathway to enhance production quality and
safety, thereby strengthening the competitive advantage of the manufacturing

Result: 建立了一个可访问、现实且公平的PU学习算法评估框架。

Conclusion: 该框架为未来PU学习算法的评估提供了更公平和现实的环境。

Abstract: Positive-unlabeled (PU) learning is a weakly supervised binary classification
problem, in which the goal is to learn a binary classifier from only positive
and unlabeled data, without access to negative data. In recent years, many PU
learning algorithms have been developed to improve model performance. However,
experimental settings are highly inconsistent, making it difficult to identify
which algorithm performs better. In this paper, we propose the first PU
learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our
implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the
realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many
PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for
model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where
no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically
investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the
problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e.,
the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols
are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant
difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of
unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet
effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across
families. We hope our framework will provide an accessible, realistic, and fair
environment for evaluating PU learning algorithms in the future.

Conclusion: LLMs在复杂战略推理任务中仍有不足，但微调模型展示了改进潜力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities.
However, a critical question remains: do these models possess genuine reasoning
skills particularly complex strategic reasoning or are they primarily excelling
at sophisticated pattern recognition within their training data? To address
this question, this paper presents a chess testbed, ChessArena, to evaluate the
strategic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Chess requires complex strategic
reasoning capabilities including long-term planning, strict rule comprehension,
and multi-turn conversation memorization. Specifically, ChessArena is a
competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different
play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard.
The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic
understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different
modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal
significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess
engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random
player that selects moves arbitrarily. We also present a strong baseline to the
testbed: our fine-tuned Qwen3-8B substantially improved performance,
approaching much larger state-of-the-art reasoning models.

Conclusion: GFM为图优化问题建立了预训练迁移的新范式，为将基础模型创新应用于OR领域打开了大门。

Abstract: The pretrain-transfer paradigm, which underpins the success of large language
models (LLMs), has demonstrated the immense power of creating foundation models
that learn generalizable representations from vast datasets. However, extending
this paradigm to Operations Research (OR) problems on graph structures remains
challenging due to the fundamental conflict between the statistical flexibility
of language and the strict combinatorial constraints of graphs. To bridge this
gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable
of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By
introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths
generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the
graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of
the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing
neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our
approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's
intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to
tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive
experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM
achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety
of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster
inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the
pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for
applying foundation model innovations to OR.

Motivation: ESP作弊难以检测，缺乏可靠标记数据，且作弊者行为多变，需要可控的模拟环境来研究。

Method: 使用强化学习建模作弊者和非作弊者，将作弊者与检测器的互动建模为对抗游戏，引入动态切换作弊行为的结构化模型。

Result: 实验显示框架成功模拟了作弊者行为，平衡了奖励优化和检测规避。

Conclusion: 该框架为研究自适应作弊行为和开发有效检测器提供了可控且可扩展的平台。

Abstract: Extra-Sensory Perception (ESP) cheats, which reveal hidden in-game
information such as enemy locations, are difficult to detect because their
effects are not directly observable in player behavior. The lack of observable
evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is
essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters
often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which
further complicates detection and detector development. To address these
challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP
cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and
non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of
observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we
formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an
adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect
realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that
dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on
detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully
simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward
optimization and detection evasion. This work provides a controllable and
extensible platform for studying adaptive cheating behaviors and developing
effective cheat detectors.

TL;DR: ELASTIQ是一种结合语言指令的EEG基础模型，通过语义任务指导和查询增强EEG表征学习，在多个任务上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG基础模型难以利用语言指令作为先验约束，限制了语义知识的整合能力。

Method: 提出ELASTIQ模型，包含联合谱-时重建模块（STR）和指令条件Q-Former（IQF），实现EEG与语言的对齐。

Result: 在20个数据集的14个上达到最优，首次揭示任务指令引导EEG嵌入的语义先验作用。

Conclusion: ELASTIQ通过语言对齐显著提升EEG表征的鲁棒性和可迁移性，代码和预训练权重将开源。

Abstract: Recent advances in electroencephalography (EEG) foundation models, which
capture transferable EEG representations, have greatly accelerated the
development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). However, existing approaches
still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for
EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic
knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address
this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language
Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates
task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned
EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In
the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction
(STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral
perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to
capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential
dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the
Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention
transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them
with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on
20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual
evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves
state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best
average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses
reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic
priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.
The code and pre-trained weights will be released.

Motivation: 分布式强化学习方法在异步计算和通信瓶颈下的理论研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了两种算法：Rennala NIGT（适用于同构环境）和Malenia NIGT（适用于异构环境），支持异步策略梯度聚合。

Result: 实验证明，两种算法在计算和通信效率上优于现有方法，且Malenia NIGT在异构环境下表现更优。

Conclusion: 新算法在分布式强化学习中实现了高效异步计算和通信，为复杂环境提供了理论保障。

Abstract: We study distributed reinforcement learning (RL) with policy gradient methods
under asynchronous and parallel computations and communications. While
non-distributed methods are well understood theoretically and have achieved
remarkable empirical success, their distributed counterparts remain less
explored, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous asynchronous
computations and communication bottlenecks. We introduce two new algorithms,
Rennala NIGT and Malenia NIGT, which implement asynchronous policy gradient
aggregation and achieve state-of-the-art efficiency. In the homogeneous
setting, Rennala NIGT provably improves the total computational and
communication complexity while supporting the AllReduce operation. In the
heterogeneous setting, Malenia NIGT simultaneously handles asynchronous
computations and heterogeneous environments with strictly better theoretical
guarantees. Our results are further corroborated by experiments, showing that
our methods significantly outperform prior approaches.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了基于通用微分方程（UDEs）的科学机器学习框架，用于预测土壤有机碳（SOC）动态，展示了其在无噪声和中等噪声条件下的潜力，但在高噪声环境下表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤有机碳（SOC）对土壤健康和全球气候韧性至关重要，但其预测因复杂的物理、化学和生物过程而困难。

Method: 使用通用微分方程（UDEs）结合机械物理和神经网络，通过合成数据集系统评估了六种实验情况。

Result: 在无噪声和中等噪声条件下，UDEs能准确重建SOC动态；但在高噪声环境下，模型出现过拟合或失效。

Conclusion: UDEs适用于可扩展且对噪声容忍的SOC预测，但需进一步改进以应对高噪声环境和实际部署需求。

Abstract: Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) is a foundation of soil health and global climate
resilience, yet its prediction remains difficult because of intricate physical,
chemical, and biological processes. In this study, we explore a Scientific
Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations
(UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend
mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural
networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using
synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases,
progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%)
multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the
potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise
settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal
profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5,
and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 =
0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic
measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear
evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy
but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise
at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture
depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of
standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs
are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing
toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic
modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.

TL;DR: SALT（Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training）是一种两阶段无正则化方法，通过冻结教师模型并训练学生模型预测掩码潜在空间，提高了视频表示学习的透明性、效率和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EMA更新教师模型带来的模型选择复杂性和师生架构耦合问题，提出更简单、高效的替代方案。

Method: 1. 训练目标编码器进行像素重建；2. 冻结教师模型，训练学生模型预测掩码潜在空间。

Result: SALT学生模型在冻结评估中优于V-JEPA 2编码器，计算效率更高，且对教师模型质量鲁棒。

Conclusion: SALT是视频表示学习中EMA自蒸馏的简单、可扩展且计算高效的替代方案。

Abstract: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable
off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space
with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents
representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples
teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show
that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with
a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze
it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This
leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT
(Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into
pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student),
increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the
ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically,
our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen
backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more
compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher
probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs
Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to
teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal
teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly
favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and
compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video
representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交梯度更新方法计算成本高（O(n^3)），且性能不如带动量的SGD。Muon虽改进效率（O(n^2)），但二次成本仍是瓶颈。

Method: 提出AuON，通过谱范数信任区域限制动量更新，结合双曲余弦RMS缩放和归一化，避免显式半正交化。还提出混合版本Hybrid-AuON。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，AuON及其混合版本性能与AdamW和Muon相当。

Conclusion: AuON在保持性能的同时显著降低计算成本，为优化问题提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in
optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as
SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and
underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is
applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon,
improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing
semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to
O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck.
  In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based
updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm
trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit
semi-orthogonalization.
  We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized
nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance
without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural
alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines
hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating
both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz
methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a
single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language
benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable
to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

Motivation: 现有相似性感知聚合方法仅适用于有干净数据的联邦学习系统，无法应对无干净数据的情况。

Method: H+通过随机选择参数向量的子段进行相似性检查，保留最相似的客户端向量进行聚合，参考向量可来自干净数据或现有鲁棒算法。

Result: H+在多种拜占庭攻击比例和类型下均表现出色，成为当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: H+不仅在有干净数据时优于现有方法，还扩展了无干净数据场景的适用性，计算复杂度低且鲁棒性强。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing
raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can
compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server.
Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate
such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on
similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data,
i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt
this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to
settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel
similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing
methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL
systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects
$r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to
the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment
against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for
aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust
algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data.
Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest
clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an
analytical time complexity of $\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of
clients and $Kr \ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a
state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness
improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and
multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios
and benchmark datasets.

Result: 在模拟基准和实际应用中，iMOOE表现出优异的分布内性能和零样本OOD泛化能力。

Conclusion: iMOOE通过捕捉PDE系统的不变性，显著提升了OOD预测的泛化能力。

Abstract: Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.

Abstract: In recent years, the generation of diverse game levels has gained increasing
interest, contributing to a richer and more engaging gaming experience. A
number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are
naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both
relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation
approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those
dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by
considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We
formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each
diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a
multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple
diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is
proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros.
demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional
diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a
range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics,
including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability
enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators
accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and
designers.

Method: 通过（i）在上下文未完全确定时应用水印，（ii）提升令牌作为上下文时的水印强度，同时保持检测器不变。

Result: 实验显示水印检测率>99%，对质量影响小，且与现有ARLM水印的鲁棒性相当。

Conclusion: 首次实现了可靠的DLM水印，解决了DLM水印化的关键挑战。

Abstract: We introduce the first watermark tailored for diffusion language models
(DLMs), an emergent LLM paradigm able to generate tokens in arbitrary order, in
contrast to standard autoregressive language models (ARLMs) which generate
tokens sequentially. While there has been much work in ARLM watermarking, a key
challenge when attempting to apply these schemes directly to the DLM setting is
that they rely on previously generated tokens, which are not always available
with DLM generation. In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying
the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are
yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark
strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while
keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with
minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM
watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.

Motivation: 尽管进化策略（ES）曾在小规模模型上表现与强化学习（RL）相当，但其在大规模模型上的可扩展性被低估，本文旨在探索ES在LLM微调中的潜力。

Method: 通过实验将ES应用于LLM的全参数微调，对比其与RL方法在样本效率、奖励稳定性、鲁棒性等方面的表现。

Result: ES在样本效率、长时程奖励容忍度、模型鲁棒性、奖励作弊倾向和性能稳定性等方面均优于RL方法。

Conclusion: ES为LLM微调提供了超越RL的新方向，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

Motivation: 时间序列异常检测需要更详细的解释，而LLM直接处理连续信号时面临挑战，缺乏上下文和表示对齐。

Method: AXIS框架通过三种提示（符号数字、上下文集成、任务先验）来增强LLM的输入，并结合新基准进行鲁棒评估。

Result: AXIS在解释质量和检测准确性上优于通用LLM、专用时间序列LLM和时间序列视觉语言模型。

Conclusion: AXIS为时间序列异常检测提供了高质量的解释和竞争性的检测性能。

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.

Conclusion: Muon是一种高效且稳健的优化器，特别适合与现代效率技术和大批量训练结合使用。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical study of the Muon
optimizer for training transformers only with a small to medium decoder (30M -
200M parameters), with an emphasis on its mathematical foundations, convergence
properties and synergistic interactions with modern architectural
optimizations. Building on recent work showing Muon's scalability, we provide
rigorous theoretical analysis including: (i)showing the convergence rate under
standard assumptions, (ii) spectral regularization properties that prevent
gradient explosion, (iii) connection to natural gradient descent on the Stiefel
manifold, and (iv) equivalence to steepest gradient descent under the spectral
norm. Crucially, we demonstrate that Muon expands the Pareto frontier in the
compute-time trade-off by maintaining superior data efficiency at large batch
sizes, a key finding of~\cite{essentialai2025muon} that we validate across our
model scales. Empirically, Muon reaches the target loss with 48-52\% of the
training calculated by AdamW while maintaining or improving the final
perplexity, consistent with larger-scale results. When combined with Multi-Head
Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), we observe multiplicative
efficiency gains: MLA+MoE+Muon achieves 68\% memory reduction and 3.2$\times$
inference speedup, while improving perplexity by 8-12\%. We provide detailed
procedures on 15 architectural and optimizer components, stability analyzes
across 100+ training runs, and practical implementation guidelines including
Newton-Schulz coefficients $(3.4445, -4.7750, 2.0315)$ optimized
by~\cite{su2024muonblog}. Our theoretical analysis and comprehensive
experiments establish Muon as a principled, robust alternative to AdamW that
particularly excels when combined with modern efficiency techniques and
large-batch training regimes.

Conclusion: ScatterAD通过量化散射现象和优化表示学习，显著提升了多元时间序列异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: One main challenge in time series anomaly detection for industrial IoT lies
in the complex spatio-temporal couplings within multivariate data. However,
traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal
dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and
limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this
work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous
samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples
are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as
scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample
representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance
spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model
representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD
incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering
and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared
error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive
fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and
topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that
maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological
views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative
representations. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that
ScatterAD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multivariate time series
anomaly detection. Code is available at this repository:

TL;DR: BiHDTrans结合了超维计算和Transformer，在边缘环境中高效处理多变量时间序列数据，显著提升了准确性和延迟性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备产生的多变量时间序列数据需要高效处理，但现有方法（如超维计算和Transformer）各有局限性。

Method: 提出BiHDTrans，将自注意力机制融入超维计算，结合两者的优势。

Result: BiHDTrans在准确性和延迟上优于现有方法，硬件加速后延迟更低。

Conclusion: BiHDTrans填补了Transformer表达能力与超维计算效率之间的差距，适用于低延迟、高精度的分类任务。

Abstract: The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于模态对齐的语义压缩方法，通过减少模态间隙实现高效的多模态嵌入压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态表示学习的高维嵌入存在存储和处理的可扩展性问题，需要在不损失语义信息的情况下进行压缩。

Method: 通过证明模态间隙与语义压缩的关系，提出了一种基于中心点的语义压缩方法，直接应用于预训练编码器。

Result: 在大规模多模态下游任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了显著的压缩而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: 模态对齐是实现语义压缩的关键，提出的方法在保持性能的同时显著减少了内存占用。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning produces high-dimensional embeddings that
align diverse modalities in a shared latent space. While this enables strong
generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of
storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve
semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings
while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across
modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the
modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different
modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the
gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but
expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore,
their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This
enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding
significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic
compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained
encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale
multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a
key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach
achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于训练大语言模型（LLM）的进化框架，通过分专家训练和进化操作减少模型大小并提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型训练中的内存占用高和计算效率低的问题。

Method: 将模型分为多个结构相同但参数不同的专家，每次训练一个专家，并通过进化操作（交叉、PSO、变异）优化权重。

Result: 最佳专家的准确率接近完整模型，训练吞吐量提升十倍以上。

Conclusion: 该框架显著减少了模型大小和训练资源需求，适合在PC和边缘设备上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents an evolutionary framework for the training of large
language models(LLM). The models are divided into several
experts(sub-networks), which have the same structure but different parameter
values. Only one expert is trained at each step. After the classical AdamW
optimization, some evolutionary operators(crossover, PSO, and mutation) act on
the tensor weights between the current expert and the best expert. So current
expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert
would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight
of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the
same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the
model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the
training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments
show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times! Our source code
is available. It's a pure c++/cu framework, which is suitable for easy
deployment on PCs and edge computing devices.

Motivation: 联邦学习在数据分布扰动下性能下降，且现有方法未充分考虑局部数据中的异常值影响。

Method: 引入基于不平衡Wasserstein距离的模糊集，结合KL惩罚，提出可分散训练的Lagrangian优化方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法在合成和真实数据集上有效。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在分布鲁棒性和异常值鲁棒性上表现优异。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without direct
data sharing, but its performance can degrade significantly in the presence of
data distribution perturbations. Distributionally robust optimization (DRO)
provides a principled framework for handling this by optimizing performance
against the worst-case distributions within a prescribed ambiguity set.
However, existing DRO-based FL methods often overlook the detrimental impact of
outliers in local datasets, which can disproportionately bias the learned
models. In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with
explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the
unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric
distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler
penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally
leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable
decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian
penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this
reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated
learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在大规模图像和表格数据集上验证了KREPES的高效性，并展示了其表示的可解释性。

Conclusion: KREPES为核方法在大规模表示学习中提供了可行的解决方案，同时具备可解释性优势。

Abstract: Kernel methods provide a theoretically grounded framework for non-linear and
non-parametric learning, with strong analytic foundations and statistical
guarantees. Yet, their scalability has long been limited by prohibitive time
and memory costs. While progress has been made in scaling kernel regression, no
framework exists for scalable kernel-based representation learning, restricting
their use in the era of foundation models where representations are learned
from massive unlabeled data. We introduce KREPES -- a unified, scalable
framework for kernel-based representation learning via Nystr\"om approximation.
KREPES accommodates a wide range of unsupervised and self-supervised losses,
and experiments on large image and tabular datasets demonstrate its efficiency.
Crucially, KREPES enables principled interpretability of the learned
representations, an immediate benefit over deep models, which we substantiate
through dedicated analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在通用排列对称性数据上缺乏原则性框架，FS-KAN填补了这一空白。

Method: 通过将参数共享方案推广到Kolmogorov-Arnold设置，构建FS-KAN层。

Result: FS-KAN在多种数据类型和对称群上表现出卓越的数据效率，同时保持KAN的可解释性。

Conclusion: FS-KAN是低数据场景下的优秀架构选择。

Abstract: Permutation equivariant neural networks employing parameter-sharing schemes
have emerged as powerful models for leveraging a wide range of data symmetries,
significantly enhancing the generalization and computational efficiency of the
resulting models. Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated
promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to
traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been
explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled
framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general
context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a
principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for
arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending
previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN
layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup
and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same
expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers,
allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from
parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data
types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency
compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain
cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making
them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.

Motivation: 解决持续学习中提示方法在任务特定和共享策略之间的性能与效率权衡问题。

Method: 采用稀疏MoE架构组织共享提示为多个专家，动态激活相关专家，并引入提示注意力评分和自适应噪声机制。

Result: 在多个持续学习基准测试中表现优于任务特定提示方法，同时显著减少参数和计算成本。

Conclusion: SMoPE有效平衡性能与效率，为持续学习提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning
(CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent
strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task,
which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes
memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely,
approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater
efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge
interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework
that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt
strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix
Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into
multiple "prompt experts" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input,
only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating
interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention
score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each
expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an
adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while
preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert
specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix
keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple
CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific
prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art
approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational
costs.

Motivation: 现有的后处理方法要么继承错误的置信度，要么仅调整预测，未能教导模型何时应表达不确定性。

Method: GUIDE通过校准阶段识别内部特征，构建噪声驱动的课程，无需重新训练或修改基础模型架构。

Result: GUIDE显著提高了分布外检测（约77%）和对抗攻击检测（约80%）的性能，同时保持分布内性能。

Conclusion: GUIDE通过主动引导不确定性，显著缩小了预测置信度与可靠性之间的差距，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification remains a major obstacle to the
deployment of deep learning models under distributional shift. Existing
post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced
confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be
uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model
approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns
how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a
calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven
curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE
requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual
intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring
broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids
distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution
detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving
in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively
guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and
reliability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型数量庞大但关系不透明，现有方法受限于任务特异性或固定模型集，需要一种通用且可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 通过数学定义LLM DNA作为功能行为的低维表示，提出了一种无需训练的通用提取流程。

Result: 在305个LLM上的实验表明，LLM DNA能揭示模型间关系，并在特定任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: LLM DNA不仅验证了已知关系，还构建了LLM的进化树，揭示了架构演变和时间趋势。

Abstract: The explosive growth of large language models (LLMs) has created a vast but
opaque landscape: millions of models exist, yet their evolutionary
relationships through fine-tuning, distillation, or adaptation are often
undocumented or unclear, complicating LLM management. Existing methods are
limited by task specificity, fixed model sets, or strict assumptions about
tokenizers or architectures. Inspired by biological DNA, we address these
limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional,
bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA
satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the
existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable,
training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA
aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or
competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons
uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct
the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with
shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal
progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.

Conclusion: TTT通过专门化提升性能，尤其在基础模型欠参数化时效果显著。

Abstract: Recent empirical studies have explored the idea of continuing to train a
model at test-time for a given task, known as test-time training (TTT), and
have found it to yield significant performance improvements. However, there is
limited understanding of why and when TTT is effective. Earlier explanations
mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to
out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the
growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution
questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain
globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization
after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task.
Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in
which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than
global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by
training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related
data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform
scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical
implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most
effective.

Result: 实验表明，物理归纳偏置能显著提升效率，同时保持或提高效能，减少碳足迹。

Conclusion: 模型效率和效能应共同成为机器学习开发的核心考量。

Abstract: Development of modern deep learning methods has been driven primarily by the
push for improving model efficacy (accuracy metrics). This sole focus on
efficacy has steered development of large-scale models that require massive
resources, and results in considerable carbon footprint across the model
life-cycle. In this work, we explore how physics inductive biases can offer
useful trade-offs between model efficacy and model efficiency (compute, energy,
and carbon). We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a
task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels
of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into
the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even
improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using
standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness
of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for
spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics
inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce
the carbon footprint of machine learning models. We argue that model
efficiency, along with model efficacy, should become a core consideration
driving machine learning model development and deployment.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LEAF表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LEAF通过专家选择和知识蒸馏有效减少了知识干扰，提升了少样本持续事件检测的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot Continual Event Detection (FCED) poses the dual challenges of
learning from limited data and mitigating catastrophic forgetting across
sequential tasks. Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due
to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge
interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation
strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To
address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based
framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts
architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection
mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling
expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve
generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive
learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level
semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on
the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that
transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive
experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在VGGSound和AudioCaps数据集上，MDG显著提升了感知质量和多模态对齐效果。

Conclusion: MDG证明了联合多模态引导在V2A生成中的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize realistic and semantically
aligned audio from silent videos, with potential applications in video editing,
Foley sound design, and assistive multimedia. Although the excellent results,
existing approaches either require costly joint training on large-scale paired
datasets or rely on pairwise similarities that may fail to capture global
multimodal coherence. In this work, we propose a novel training-free multimodal
guidance mechanism for V2A diffusion that leverages the volume spanned by the
modality embeddings to enforce unified alignment across video, audio, and text.
The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight,
plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio
diffusion model without retraining. Experiments on VGGSound and AudioCaps
demonstrate that our MDG consistently improves perceptual quality and
multimodal alignment compared to baselines, proving the effectiveness of a
joint multimodal guidance for V2A.

Result: SWAX在短上下文和长上下文任务中均显著优于常规窗口注意力方法。

Conclusion: 随机调整窗口大小的训练策略能有效平衡模型对短上下文和长上下文的需求，提升整体性能。

Abstract: Recent works show that hybrid architectures combining sliding window softmax
attention layers with linear recurrent neural network (RNN) layers outperform
both of these architectures taken separately. However, the impact of the window
length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain
under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture
consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers.
  A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not
improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention
encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by
relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval.
  The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for
short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately
larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically
changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer
context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes
significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and
long-context problems.

Motivation: 解决高雷诺数下涡激振动的实时控制问题，克服传统低雷诺数模拟的局限性及实际约束（如驱动延迟）。

Method: 采用DRL算法，通过状态反馈（位移和速度）学习旋转控制策略，并引入历史控制动作以优化高频驱动效果。

Result: 低频驱动策略实现80%振动抑制，高频驱动策略提升至95%以上。

Conclusion: DRL在真实实验中表现出强大的适应性和克服驱动延迟的能力，为主动流控制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV)
in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary
actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number
numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a
challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints
such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state
feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL
agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80%
vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While
this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance
achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is
attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning
algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a
high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex
shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate
the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to
overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.

Conclusion: OpenVLA隐含学习世界模型，且该能力随训练进展而增强，未来可通过稀疏自编码器进一步分析。

Abstract: Vision Language Action models (VLAs) trained with policy-based reinforcement
learning (RL) encode complex behaviors without explicitly modeling
environmental dynamics. However, it remains unclear whether VLAs implicitly
learn world models, a hallmark of model-based RL. We propose an experimental
methodology using embedding arithmetic on state representations to probe
whether OpenVLA, the current state of the art in VLAs, contains latent
knowledge of state transitions. Specifically, we measure the difference between
embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition
vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non
linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically
significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines
(embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as
opposed to the probes learning the state transitions). We investigate the
predictive ability of an earlier checkpoint of OpenVLA, and uncover hints that
the world model emerges as training progresses. Finally, we outline a pipeline
leveraging Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to analyze OpenVLA's world model.

*Yusuf Guven,Vincenzo Di Vito,Ferdinando Fioretto*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的框架，结合动态预测器和优化代理，用于高效解决PDE约束的优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PDE约束的优化问题在科学和工程领域广泛存在，但计算复杂度高，需要处理高维离散化和动态约束。

Method: 采用双网络设计，动态预测器（神经算子）近似PDE动态轨迹，优化代理近似最优决策。

Result: 在多个PDE优化任务中验证，计算速度提升四个数量级，解质量与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了PDE约束优化问题的计算效率，同时保持了高解质量。

Abstract: Partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization arises in many
scientific and engineering domains, such as energy systems, fluid dynamics and
material design. In these problems, the decision variables (e.g., control
inputs or design parameters) are tightly coupled with the PDE state variables,
and the feasible set is implicitly defined by the governing PDE constraints.
This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires
handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that
integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic
predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently
approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the
optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to
approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables
real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the
coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach
on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation,
heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution
quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct
Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of
magnitude improvement in computational speed.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定的比例调整先验与似然贡献，限制了性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出SAIP模块，动态调整每个时间步的比例，无需修改扩散模型主干。

Result: SAIP在多种图像恢复任务中显著提升重建质量。

Conclusion: SAIP是一种高效且通用的解决方案，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with diffusion models has shown promise in tasks
such as image restoration. A common approach is to formulate the problem in a
Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score
with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable,
estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these
methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood
contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies
across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization. To address
this issue, we propose SAIP, a plug-and-play module that adaptively refines the
scale at each timestep without retraining or altering the diffusion backbone.
SAIP integrates seamlessly into existing samplers and consistently improves
reconstruction quality across diverse image restoration tasks, including
challenging scenarios.

Motivation: 现有设备上AI架构在资源受限环境中存在参数需求大且泛化性差的问题，无法适应多领域任务。

Method: 提出CURA架构，通过模拟音频信号处理电路实现紧凑和轻量化的设计，适用于多种机器学习任务。

Conclusion: CURA是一种高效、通用的架构，适用于资源受限环境中的多领域任务。

Abstract: Existing on-device AI architectures for resource-constrained environments
face two critical limitations: they lack compactness, with parameter
requirements scaling proportionally to task complexity, and they exhibit poor
generalizability, performing effectively only on specific application domains
(e.g., models designed for regression tasks cannot adapt to natural language
processing (NLP) applications). In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture
inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and
lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple
domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches:
(1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task
complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression,
classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern
recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely
low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains.
For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer
parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated
consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision
dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to
90%). Lastly, it delivers superior forecasting accuracy for complex patterns,
achieving 1.6 times lower mean absolute error and 2.1 times lower mean squared
error than competing models.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估分类模型时，需要综合考虑决策阈值的影响，而DCA和成本曲线是两种常用方法，但它们的联系和差异尚不明确。

Method: 通过理论分析和比较DCA与Brier曲线的数学关系，探讨它们的异同点。

Result: 结果表明，DCA和Brier曲线在假设模型分数校准且分类阈值设定一致时等价，但Brier曲线适用范围更广。

Conclusion: 结论是Brier曲线更具通用性，且其曲线下面积即为Brier分数，建议在DCA中使用上包络决策曲线作为比较基准。

Abstract: Classification models typically predict a score and use a decision threshold
to produce a classification. Appropriate model evaluation should carefully
consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative
value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which
affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and
cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility
and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision
thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related,
and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are
closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both
curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the
classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and
negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net
benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always
choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds,
differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit
cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider
range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the
Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be
included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful
comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be
achieved through recalibration alone.

Conclusion: OrthAlign通过数学方法解决多目标冲突，为LLM对齐提供了稳定且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing
multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at
the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing
objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses
on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to
mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of
resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present
OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging
orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level
conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically
decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that
optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically
non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical
guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal
subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit
linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable
convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that:
I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from
34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless,
and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of
13.96%.

Conclusion: RO-HNN成功将哈密顿神经网络的应用范围扩展到高维物理系统。

Abstract: By embedding physical intuition, network architectures enforce fundamental
properties, such as energy conservation laws, leading to plausible predictions.
Yet, scaling these models to intrinsically high-dimensional systems remains a
significant challenge. This paper introduces Geometric Reduced-order
Hamiltonian Neural Network (RO-HNN), a novel physics-inspired neural network
that combines the conservation laws of Hamiltonian mechanics with the
scalability of model order reduction. RO-HNN is built on two core components: a
novel geometrically-constrained symplectic autoencoder that learns a
low-dimensional, structure-preserving symplectic submanifold, and a geometric
Hamiltonian neural network that models the dynamics on the submanifold. Our
experiments demonstrate that RO-HNN provides physically-consistent, stable, and
generalizable predictions of complex high-dimensional dynamics, thereby
effectively extending the scope of Hamiltonian neural networks to
high-dimensional physical systems.

Motivation: 大语言模型在组合推理任务中表现不佳，尤其是两跳推理任务，作者希望通过简单的方法解决这一问题。

Method: 引入Identity Bridge机制，监督模型在零跳身份任务上的表现，并通过理论分析和实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: Identity Bridge通过隐式核范数正则化优化模型潜在几何结构，提升组合推理能力，并为大规模模型的推理能力改进提供了启示。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances, large language models often fail at
compositional reasoning tasks, a phenomenon exemplified by the ``curse of
two-hop reasoning''. This paper introduces the Identity Bridge, a simple yet
powerful mechanism that resolves this compositionality gap by supervising the
model on a zero-hop identity task. We demonstrate empirically that this
addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop
reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon,
we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving
that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this
alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during
optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across
tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to
enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment
effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our
investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop
reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for
enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物序列（如mRNA）具有层次结构，而默认的欧几里得几何可能不匹配这种结构。双曲几何更适合层次数据，但尚未应用于mRNA语言建模。

Method: HyperHELM采用混合设计，在欧几里得骨干网络上添加双曲层，以对齐mRNA与氨基酸关系的生物层次结构。

Result: 在10个任务中的9个上优于欧几里得基线模型，平均提升10%，并在长序列和低GC含量序列的分布外泛化中表现优异。抗体区域注释准确率比层次感知欧几里得模型高3%。

Conclusion: 双曲几何是mRNA序列层次语言建模的有效归纳偏置。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly applied to biological sequences like
proteins and mRNA, yet their default Euclidean geometry may mismatch the
hierarchical structures inherent to biological data. While hyperbolic geometry
provides a better alternative for accommodating hierarchical data, it has yet
to find a way into language modeling for mRNA sequences. In this work, we
introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution
generalization to long and low-GC content sequences; for antibody region
annotation, it surpasses hierarchy-aware Euclidean models by 3% in annotation
accuracy. Our results highlight hyperbolic geometry as an effective inductive
bias for hierarchical language modeling of mRNA sequences.

Result: T-POP在实验中表现优于基线方法，数据效率高且随用户交互持续改进。

Conclusion: T-POP为LLM实时个性化提供了高效、数据友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalizing large language models (LLMs) to individual user preferences is
a critical step beyond generating generically helpful responses. However,
current personalization methods are ill-suited for new users, as they typically
require either slow, resource-intensive fine-tuning or a substantial amount of
pre-existing user data, creating a significant cold-start problem. To address
this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by
learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text
generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference
Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment
with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the
decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that
captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently
queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and
exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient
personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing
consistent improvement with more user interactions.

Result: 实验表明，FedPOB和FedPOB-Pref显著优于基线方法，且性能随协作代理增加而提升。

Conclusion: 联邦提示优化框架有效解决了实际应用中的三大挑战，并通过协作学习实现了性能提升。

Abstract: The performance of large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the
input prompt, making prompt optimization a critical task. However, real-world
application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of
powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query
costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple
users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel
framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on
multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this
problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2)
practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with
theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first
propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a
federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by
sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to
the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with
Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated
dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and
FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their
performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the
collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) reward models exhibit
systematic failures on longtail distributions, leading to reward hacking and
misalignment. We propose a mechanistic interpretability framework that
identifies specialized neural circuits responsible for rare-event processing in
reward models. Drawing from recent advances showing distributed specialization
for rare tokens in language models\citep{liu2025no, liu2025emergent}, we
hypothesize that reward models also develop functionally distinct circuits for
longtail scenarios. Our theoretical framework establishes formal connections
between circuit specialization, reward generalization bounds, and longtail
performance. We introduce \textbf{Circuit-Aware Reward Training (CART)}, which
uses circuit analysis to guide data augmentation, regularization, and ensemble
strategies. This approach provides both theoretical insights into reward model
failures and practical interventions for improving longtail robustness.

Conclusion: Q-Net具有空间和时间可转移性，适合集成到动态的基于排队的交通控制系统中。

Abstract: Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in
traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where
vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a
data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that
performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated.
Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i)
vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated
floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and
provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often
differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net
addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented
Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without
requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We
build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality
from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments.
Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with
internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main
roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms
baseline methods by over 60\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately
tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays.
Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling
deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar.
Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its
potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.

Result: 实验表明，catnat在图形结构学习、变分自编码器和强化学习中提高了学习效率，并提升了测试性能。

Conclusion: catnat是softmax的更好替代方案，易于实现且兼容现有训练稳定技术。

Abstract: Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques
and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\textit{softmax}$ function.

Abstract: Multimodal learning plays a pivotal role in advancing artificial intelligence
systems by incorporating information from multiple modalities to build a more
comprehensive representation. Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art
models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful
development of a fully multimodal model. Such methods may not provide
indicators that all the involved modalities are effectively aligned. As a
result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of
the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide
additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we
present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed
similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space
spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of
three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion
layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses
replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of
multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales.
Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text
retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves
state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of
cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.

TL;DR: RPEX是一种新颖的离线到在线强化学习方法，通过IPW减轻数据污染导致的策略重尾问题，提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实环境中离线数据和在线交互常受噪声或恶意污染，影响O2O RL性能，现有方法未充分解决数据污染的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出RPEX方法，结合IPW调整在线探索策略，缓解重尾行为。

Result: 在D4RL数据集上，RPEX在多种数据污染场景中表现最优。

Conclusion: RPEX简单有效，显著提升了O2O RL在数据污染下的性能。

Abstract: Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online
interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has
emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both
offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often
noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O
RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline
policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data
corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still
unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed
behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of
online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability
Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate
heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed
$\textbf{RPEX}$: $\textbf{R}$obust $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{EX}$pansion.
Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves
SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios. Code is

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于预训练的通用推理模型FIM-PP，用于多类型事件序列建模，无需针对每个目标系统单独训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需为每个目标系统训练专用模型，效率低且不灵活。

Method: 利用摊销推理和上下文学习，预训练深度神经网络从事件序列中推断条件强度函数。

Result: FIM-PP在多个基准数据集上达到了专用模型的预测性能，且无需额外训练。

Conclusion: FIM-PP展示了预训练模型在事件序列建模中的潜力，可快速适应新系统。

Abstract: Modeling event sequences of multiple event types with marked temporal point
processes (MTPPs) provides a principled way to uncover governing dynamical
rules and predict future events. Current neural network approaches to MTPP
inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system.
We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and
in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context,
the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined
by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic
dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once
pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can
estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be
rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized
approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction
across common benchmark datasets.
  Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online

TL;DR: CHARM将幻觉检测转化为图学习任务，通过图神经网络（GNN）处理标记的图结构，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）常生成错误或未经支持的内容（幻觉），现有检测方法依赖启发式或简单模型，缺乏统一信号。

Method: 将信号统一表示为属性图（节点为标记，边为注意力流），应用GNN进行图学习任务。

Result: CHARM在多个基准测试中优于其他方法，并展示出跨数据集零样本迁移潜力。

Conclusion: 图结构和计算痕迹的结合对幻觉检测至关重要，CHARM表现出色且具泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content,
known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or
simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or
attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed
graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry
features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts
hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying
GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes
prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently
outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results
shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the
benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits
promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成模型MSM Emulators，通过Markov State Model (MSM)学习离散状态间的转移，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分子动力学模拟计算成本高，现有生成模型因学习固定滞后转移密度而效果不佳。

Method: 引入MSM Emulators，具体实现为Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM)，通过MSM学习状态转移。

Result: MarS-FM比传统模拟快两个数量级，且在多种结构指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSM Emulators在效率和准确性上均有显著优势，适用于复杂蛋白质系统。

Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing
methods, often by a substantial margin.

Motivation: 现有模仿学习基准在训练和评估之间缺乏足够变化，难以评估泛化能力。

Method: 设计Labyrinth环境，控制结构、起点、目标和任务复杂度，支持离散、完全可观测的状态空间和已知最优动作。

Result: Labyrinth支持可验证的不同训练、评估和测试设置，提供可解释性和细粒度评估。

Conclusion: Labyrinth通过可控、可复现的实验，推动了模仿学习中泛化能力的评估，并为开发更鲁棒的智能体提供了工具。

Abstract: Imitation learning benchmarks often lack sufficient variation between
training and evaluation, limiting meaningful generalisation assessment. We
introduce Labyrinth, a benchmarking environment designed to test generalisation
with precise control over structure, start and goal positions, and task
complexity. It enables verifiably distinct training, evaluation, and test
settings. Labyrinth provides a discrete, fully observable state space and known
optimal actions, supporting interpretability and fine-grained evaluation. Its
flexible setup allows targeted testing of generalisation factors and includes
variants like partial observability, key-and-door tasks, and ice-floor hazards.
By enabling controlled, reproducible experiments, Labyrinth advances the
evaluation of generalisation in imitation learning and provides a valuable tool
for developing more robust agents.

*Felix Strnad,Jonathan Schmidt,Fabian Mockert,Philipp Hennig,Nicole Ludwig*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究分析了德国未来几十年因可再生能源依赖天气导致的Dunkelflaute事件（低风能和太阳能发电期）对电力生产的影响，发现其频率和持续时间在气候情景下保持稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 欧洲电网转向可再生能源，但天气依赖性可能导致电网不稳定，尤其是Dunkelflaute事件可能引发电力短缺。

Method: 采用生成式深度学习框架降尺度CMIP6气候模拟数据，并与历史数据（ERA5）对比，评估未来Dunkelflaute事件的发生情况。

Result: 在SSP2-4.5和SSP5-8.5排放情景下，Dunkelflaute事件的频率和持续时间与历史时期相比基本不变。

Conclusion: 在考虑的气候情景下，Dunkelflaute事件的风险预计将保持稳定，电网规划需关注这一稳定性。

Abstract: The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the
historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios,
the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.

Result: 实验验证了Fidel-TS的有效性，揭示了先前基准的偏差和设计缺陷，并证明文本信息的因果相关性是多模态预测性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: Fidel-TS为时间序列预测提供了高质量的评估基准，强调了因果严谨性在多模态预测中的重要性。

Abstract: The evaluation of time series forecasting models is hindered by a critical
lack of high-quality benchmarks, leading to a potential illusion of progress.
Existing datasets suffer from issues ranging from pre-training data
contamination in the age of LLMs to the causal and description leakage
prevalent in early multimodal designs. To address this, we formalize the core
principles of high-fidelity benchmarking, focusing on data sourcing integrity,
strict causal soundness, and structural clarity. We introduce Fidel-TS, a new
large-scale benchmark built from the ground up on these principles by sourcing
data from live APIs. Our extensive experiments validate this approach by
exposing the critical biases and design limitations of prior benchmarks.
Furthermore, we conclusively demonstrate that the causal relevance of textual
information is the key factor in unlocking genuine performance gains in
multimodal forecasting.

TL;DR: DSAT-HD是一种结合混合分解和双流自适应Transformer的时间序列预测方法，解决了现有方法在捕捉多尺度特征和复杂季节性趋势分解上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉不同时间尺度的多样化特征，且传统季节性分解方法需要预定义周期，无法处理复杂季节性。

Method: 1) 混合分解机制结合EMA和傅里叶分解；2) 多尺度自适应路径和稀疏分配器；3) 双流残差学习框架。

Result: 在九个数据集上表现优于现有方法，部分数据集达到SOTA，且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: DSAT-HD通过创新设计有效提升了时间序列预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.

Result: 当物理先验信息对齐时，学习速率显著提升，且不受数据依赖性的样本量缩减影响。

Conclusion: 物理先验信息的对齐可以显著提升学习速率，为依赖数据的机器学习提供理论支持。

Abstract: A major challenge in physics-informed machine learning is to understand how
the incorporation of prior domain knowledge affects learning rates when data
are dependent. Focusing on empirical risk minimization with physics-informed
regularization, we derive complexity-dependent bounds on the excess risk in
probability and in expectation. We prove that, when the physical prior
information is aligned, the learning rate improves from the (slow) Sobolev
minimax rate to the (fast) optimal i.i.d. one without any sample-size deflation
due to data dependence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统世界模型在处理视觉任务时未能解耦动态对象和静态背景的问题，导致计算效率低下。

Method: 引入动态调制机制，利用帧间差分掩码提取动态特征，并将其整合到RSSM中。

Result: 在Atari 100k、DeepMind Visual Control Suite和Crafter基准测试中表现优异，刷新记录。

Conclusion: DyMoDreamer通过动态调制机制显著提升了MBRL的性能和样本效率。

Abstract: A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is
released at https://github.com/Ultraman-Tiga1/DyMoDreamer.

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.

Method: 研究使用了逻辑回归、随机森林和梯度提升（XGBoost）等机器学习模型，分析了流媒体流行度、音频信号属性和人类听歌行为的概率指标。

Result: 流行度是最强预测因素，其他如乐器感、情感、时长和语言性也有显著贡献。所有模型准确率均超过90%，随机森林表现最佳（90.4%准确率）。

Conclusion: 研究表明流行度是预测歌曲进入Billboard Hot 100的主要因素，机器学习模型在此任务中表现出色，为音乐产业提供了有价值的分析工具。

Abstract: The advent of digital streaming platforms have recently revolutionized the
landscape of music industry, with the ensuing digitalization providing
structured data collections that open new research avenues for investigating
popularity dynamics and mainstream success. The present work explored which
determinants hold the strongest predictive influence for a track's inclusion in
the Billboard Hot 100 charts, including streaming popularity, measurable audio
signal attributes, and probabilistic indicators of human listening. The
analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of
Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from
instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness. Logistic Regression
achieved 90.0% accuracy, with very high recall for charting singles (0.986) but
lower recall for non-charting ones (0.813), yielding balanced F1-scores around
0.90. Random Forest slightly improved performance to 90.4% accuracy,
maintaining near-perfect precision for non-charting singles (0.990) and high
recall for charting ones (0.992), with F1-scores up to 0.91. Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) reached 90.3% accuracy, delivering a more balanced trade-off by
improving recall for non-charting singles (0.837) while sustaining high recall
for charting ones (0.969), resulting in F1-scores comparable to the other
models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于自注意力的PDE求解器因局部性导致全局耦合不足，引发误差累积和漂移。

Method: 采用频谱分支捕获全局低频信息，图像分支处理局部细节，通过带权融合避免训练不稳定。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes基准测试中，相对L1误差降低7%-54%，参数减少15%，吞吐量高于scOT。

Conclusion: DRIFT-Net设计稳定有效，显著提升了PDE求解的精度和效率。

Abstract: Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve
wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers.
In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale
windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \textsc{Poseidon} serving as
a representative example.
  However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral
coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window
shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and
drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose
\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral
branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing
global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses
on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform
controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the
spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the
width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The
fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image
branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details
across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net
achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under
identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the
relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\%--54\%, the parameter count decreases
by about 15\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies
and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of
this design. The code is available at

Motivation: 在土壤分析任务中，人类专家需要根据模型的置信度调整决策，因此可靠的不确定性量化对提高协作效率和专家干预的针对性至关重要。

Method: 采用共形预测框架校准SoilNet模型的不确定性，并设计了一个模拟的人类参与标注流程（HIL），在模型不确定性高时使用有限的专家标注预算。

Result: 实验表明，共形化后的SoilNet在回归任务中标注效率更高，分类任务中性能相当，且标注预算相同。

Conclusion: 共形预测能有效提升SoilNet的不确定性校准，从而优化人机协作和专家资源的使用。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential in human-machine collaboration, as
human agents tend to adjust their decisions based on the confidence of the
machine counterpart. Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable
more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible
usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well
established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models,
offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and
classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to
$\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles.
We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a
limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is
available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that
conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks
and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same
annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart. All code

Abstract: Neural scaling laws underlie many of the recent advances in deep learning,
yet their theoretical understanding remains largely confined to linear models.
In this work, we present a systematic analysis of scaling laws for quadratic
and diagonal neural networks in the feature learning regime. Leveraging
connections with matrix compressed sensing and LASSO, we derive a detailed
phase diagram for the scaling exponents of the excess risk as a function of
sample complexity and weight decay. This analysis uncovers crossovers between
distinct scaling regimes and plateau behaviors, mirroring phenomena widely
reported in the empirical neural scaling literature. Furthermore, we establish
a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained
network weights, which we characterize in detail. As a consequence, we provide
a theoretical validation of recent empirical observations connecting the
emergence of power-law tails in the weight spectrum with network generalization

Abstract: Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning,
enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form.
Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during
training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation
theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \emph{adaptive
canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends
both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive
canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the
input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove
that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that
admit universal approximation properties.
  We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis
ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational
symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular
and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our
adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to
equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and
equivariant architectures.

Result: PLMs更倾向于编码局部残基关系，结构最忠实编码通常出现在接近最后一层的位置。

Conclusion: 在接近最后一层的PLMs上训练折叠模型可能提高折叠性能。

Abstract: While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of
research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform
sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such
representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to
propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding
how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in
which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is
still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of
sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root
velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally
lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations
can be compared with each other.
  We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that
the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a
non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different
sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context
lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find
that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between
residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most
structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last
layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these
layers might lead to improved folding performance.

TL;DR: LLMs通过监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）在序列决策中优化探索策略，但可能过早放弃探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何通过SFT和RL改进LLMs在序列决策中的探索能力及其泛化性。

Method: 使用SFT和RL训练LLMs，包括定制奖励信号（如后悔形状奖励和算法奖励）。

Result: 训练后的LLMs表现优于预训练模型，接近UCB和Thompson Sampling，并能泛化到更长的时间跨度和不同任务。

Conclusion: SFT和RL各有优劣，需定制奖励设计和评估以促进稳健的探索行为。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) hold promise to become autonomous agents,
they often explore suboptimally in sequential decision-making. Recent work has
sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or
reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit
task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration
strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by
training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored
reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance,
and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents
outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper
Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x
longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that
gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT
agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models,
prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB
learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our
findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate
tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust
exploratory behavior.

Conclusion: 序列方法在引入软约束后性能与结构方法相当，质疑了抗体贝叶斯优化中结构信息的必要性。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody
therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However,
finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly
structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the
property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior
works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody
Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to
incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare
them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody
properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of
a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the
optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of
structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for
stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating
the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap
is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in
sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods,
raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for
antibodies.

Motivation: 现有Flow Matching方法隐含的直线化目标与最小化物理加速度相关，OAT-FM旨在优化这一过程。

Method: OAT-FM在样本和速度乘积空间中优化加速度传输，设计高效算法实现低复杂度。

Result: OAT-FM在多种生成任务中一致提升模型性能，避免数据分布漂移和大量噪声数据需求。

Conclusion: OAT-FM为Flow Matching提供新范式，通过两阶段训练显著提升生成模型效果。

Abstract: As a powerful technique in generative modeling, Flow Matching (FM) aims to
learn velocity fields from noise to data, which is often explained and
implemented as solving Optimal Transport (OT) problems. In this study, we
bridge FM and the recent theory of Optimal Acceleration Transport (OAT),
developing an improved FM method called OAT-FM and exploring its benefits in
both theory and practice. In particular, we demonstrate that the straightening
objective hidden in existing OT-based FM methods is mathematically equivalent
to minimizing the physical action associated with acceleration defined by OAT.
Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the
acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose
objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow
straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low
complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative
model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been
relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm
eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large
number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in
various generative tasks. Code is available at:

Motivation: 深度强化学习训练成本高且需要大量调参，迁移学习可复用已有知识，但现有方法中神经网络内部表示的高相关性限制了线性函数逼近的效果。

Method: 在深度Q学习中引入正则化项以减少状态特征表示的正相关性，从而提升线性函数逼近在迁移学习中的表现。

Conclusion: 通过减少特征表示的正相关性，该方法显著提升了线性函数逼近在迁移学习中的效果，为降低训练成本提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated success in solving complex
sequential decision-making problems by integrating neural networks with the RL
framework. However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as
the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs.
Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these
challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for
new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from
scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage
the internal representations learned by the neural network during training.
Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as
refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the
input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used
as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on
new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL
models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used
with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a
novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce
positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging
these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear
function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation
studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the
efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby
reducing computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有推理算法（如链式思考和多分支推理）增加了令牌使用和延迟，但现有方法往往牺牲准确性以减少令牌使用。

Method: DUCHESS使用轻量级线性探测模型预测分支正确性，并通过分支编排策略动态管理分支。

Result: 在三个推理基准测试中，DUCHESS显著减少令牌使用（42-63%）和延迟（57-85%），同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: DUCHESS通过智能分支管理和任务优先级调度，在降低成本和延迟的同时不牺牲准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on inference-time reasoning
algorithms such as chain-of-thought and multi-branch reasoning to improve
accuracy on complex tasks. These methods, however, substantially increase token
usage and per-request latency. Prior work has largely focused on reducing token
usage, often at the expense of accuracy, while overlooking other latency
factors. We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and
latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration
guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over
LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration
policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When
handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing
easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt.
Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently
improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at
matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS
reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with
First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under
difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.

Result: 实验表明OAR显著优于恒定正则化方法。

Conclusion: OAR是首个利用重叠权重正则化的方法，显著提升低重叠区域的CATE估计。

Abstract: The conditional average treatment effect (CATE) is widely used in
personalized medicine to inform therapeutic decisions. However,
state-of-the-art methods for CATE estimation (so-called meta-learners) often
perform poorly in the presence of low overlap. In this work, we introduce a new
approach to tackle this issue and improve the performance of existing
meta-learners in the low-overlap regions. Specifically, we introduce
Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models
proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is
higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is
the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of
the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing
CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and
non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions
of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and
thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic
experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation
in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.

Conclusion: 自回归模型在小数据集上更高效，离散扩散模型需足够资源和计算才具竞争力。

Abstract: Data scarcity drives the need for more sample-efficient large language
models. In this work, we use the double descent phenomenon to holistically
compare the sample efficiency of discrete diffusion and autoregressive models.
We show that discrete diffusion models require larger capacity and more
training epochs to escape their underparameterized regime and reach the
interpolation threshold. In the strongly overparameterized regime, both models
exhibit similar behavior, with neither exhibiting a pronounced second descent
in test loss across a large range of model sizes. Overall, our results indicate
that autoregressive models are more sample-efficient on small-scale datasets,
while discrete diffusion models only become competitive when given sufficient
capacity and compute.

Motivation: 改进现有RLVR方法在数学推理中的训练不稳定和多样性问题。

Method: 提出ROVER算法，利用固定随机策略的Q函数恢复最优动作，避免复杂的策略迭代。

Result: ROVER在质量和多样性上显著提升（pass@1 +8.2，pass@256 +16.8，多样性+17.6%）。

Conclusion: ROVER通过简化方法有效提升LLM数学推理能力，优于复杂现有方法。

Abstract: RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current
methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO,
which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating
the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While
effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse,
requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard
RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov
Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured
dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying
structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL
algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated
techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this
insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from
the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the
generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce
Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this
principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a
minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax
over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout
training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across
multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates
superior performance in both \textbf{quality} (\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1,
\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \textbf{diversity} (\textbf{+17.6\%}), despite
its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.

Result: 理论保证统一多种核函数，实验显示稳定性和样本效率提升。

Conclusion: 研究为PPO提供了更坚实的理论基础，并验证了RKHS方法在实践中的有效性。

Abstract: We revisit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) from a function-space
perspective. Our analysis decouples policy evaluation and improvement in a
reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS): (i) A kernelized temporal-difference
(TD) critic performs efficient RKHS-gradient updates using only one-step
state-action transition samples; (ii) a KL-regularized, natural-gradient policy
step exponentiates the evaluated action-value, recovering a PPO/TRPO-style
proximal update in continuous state-action spaces. We provide non-asymptotic,
instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying
tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes,
and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal
$k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the
theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common
control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains
favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline. Altogether, our results place PPO
on a firmer theoretical footing beyond finite-dimensional assumptions and
clarify when RKHS-proximal updates with kernel-TD critics yield global policy
improvement with practical efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究巩固了基于分数的MIA理论，并指出需要进一步理解VAE的反演问题，而不仅仅是扩散过程的反演。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against diffusion models have emerged as
a pressing privacy concern, as these models may inadvertently reveal whether a
given sample was part of their training set. We present a theoretical and
empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors
that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser
output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples,
such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals
membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query
attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing
multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across
variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent
Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due
to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We
further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters
($\beta$ in $\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM
training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based
MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better
understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion
process

Abstract: Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant
threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires
increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also
reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger;
however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its
predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To
address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that
jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance
short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our
best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected
Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both
predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of
the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision
support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting
low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire
danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast
horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with
time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic
uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty
types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary
insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their
joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach
significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger
forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.

Abstract: The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models "thinking out loud" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to "think while speaking," which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional "thoughts". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.

database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了令牌在变压器模型中的多尺度动态行为，为理解模型内部机制提供了理论支持。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of tokens through the depth of
encoder-only transformer models at inference time by modeling them as a system
of particles interacting in a mean-field way and studying the corresponding
dynamics. More specifically, we consider this problem in the moderate
interaction regime, where the number $N$ of tokens is large and the inverse
temperature parameter $\beta$ of the model scales together with $N$. In this
regime, the dynamics of the system displays a multiscale behavior: a fast
phase, where the token empirical measure collapses on a low-dimensional space,
an intermediate phase, where the measure further collapses into clusters, and a
slow one, where such clusters sequentially merge into a single one. We provide
a rigorous characterization of the limiting dynamics in each of these phases
and prove convergence in the above mentioned limit, exemplifying our results
with some simulations.

Result: 提出了基于轨迹不变性的调优规则，并改进了现有的缩放定律。

Conclusion: 研究为高效超参数调优提供了新原则，并启发了未来关于缩放定律的研究。

Abstract: As hyperparameter tuning becomes increasingly costly at scale, efficient
tuning methods are essential. Yet principles for guiding hyperparameter tuning
remain limited. In this work, we seek to establish such principles by
considering a broad range of hyperparameters, including batch size, learning
rate, and weight decay. We identify a phenomenon we call trajectory invariance,
where pre-training loss curves, gradient noise, and gradient norm exhibit
invariance--closely overlapping--with respect to a quantity that combines
learning rate and weight decay. This phenomenon effectively reduces the
original two-dimensional hyperparameter space to one dimension, yielding an
efficient tuning rule: follow the salient direction revealed by trajectory
invariance. Furthermore, we refine previous scaling laws and challenge several
existing viewpoints. Overall, our work proposes new principles for efficient
tuning and inspires future research on scaling laws.

*Shuchen Xue,Chongjian Ge,Shilong Zhang,Yichen Li,Zhi-Ming Ma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AWM的新方法，通过统一预训练和强化学习目标，降低了方差并加速了收敛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法（如DDPO）与扩散模型的预训练目标不一致，导致方差增加和收敛速度慢。

Method: 提出Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)，使用与预训练相同的目标函数，并通过优势加权样本。

Result: AWM在多个基准测试中实现了高达24倍的加速，且不降低生成质量。

Conclusion: AWM统一了预训练和RL目标，减少了方差并提升了性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a central paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), where pre-training and RL post-training share the
same log-likelihood formulation. In contrast, recent RL approaches for
diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO),
optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow
matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is
an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases
variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce
\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for
diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a
lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect,
AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones
while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies
pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with
policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This
simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and
PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO
(which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX,
without compromising generation quality. Code is available at

Motivation: 数据驱动模型在科学领域（如天气预报）中应用广泛，但在分布外（OOD）数据上可能失效，亟需可靠的检测方法。

Result: 在多个科学数据集（如PDE、卫星图像等）上，该方法能有效预测误差。

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可验证的‘信任证书’提供了基础，有助于评估AI预测的可信度。

Abstract: Data-driven models are increasingly adopted in critical scientific fields
like weather forecasting and fluid dynamics. These methods can fail on
out-of-distribution (OOD) data, but detecting such failures in regression tasks
is an open challenge. We propose a new OOD detection method based on estimating
joint likelihoods using a score-based diffusion model. This approach considers
not just the input but also the regression model's prediction, providing a
task-aware reliability score. Across numerous scientific datasets, including
PDE datasets, satellite imagery and brain tumor segmentation, we show that this
likelihood strongly correlates with prediction error. Our work provides a
foundational step towards building a verifiable 'certificate of trust', thereby
offering a practical tool for assessing the trustworthiness of AI-based
scientific predictions. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLM训练中的一致性现象，展示了损失曲线在最优超参数下可以归一化为通用轨迹，并提出了两种应用场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM训练中的一致性现象是否适用于实际扩展方案，以及如何利用这一现象优化训练过程。

Method: 通过实验验证损失曲线在不同规模模型中的归一化现象，并分析超参数设置对归一化的影响。

Result: 发现损失曲线在最优超参数下可以归一化为通用轨迹，并提出了两种应用：训练病理诊断和超参数调优中的早期停止。

Conclusion: 归一化现象是计算高效训练的标志，可用于开发高效LLM，如论文中提到的Celerity模型家族。

Abstract: Effective LLM training relies on *consistency*, meaning that key quantities
-- such as final losses and optimal hyperparameters -- scale predictably across
model sizes. Qiu et al. (2025) recently showed that this consistency extends
beyond scalars: whole training loss curves can *collapse* onto a universal
trajectory after a simple normalization. What remains unclear is whether this
phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*,
where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled
jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely
when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget,
in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a
signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at
scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of
training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables
early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a
competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse
as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.

Abstract: We introduce ORPO-Distill, a general-purpose method for cross-architecture
LLM distillation that formulates the problem as a preference optimization task.
Unlike standard CoT distillation, the approach transfers knowledge through
diverse reasoning traces. It employs an Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization
objective that contrasts teacher and student traces for more effective

outputs, outperforming both off- and on-policy alternatives. Experiments on

Method: 结合实验测量探针与合成对象进行无监督训练，强调探针学习。

Result: 模型在跨光束线实验中表现优异，重建质量与实验数据训练相当。

Conclusion: 该方法支持动态实验条件下的实时反馈模型训练。

Abstract: X-ray ptychography is a data-intensive imaging technique expected to become
ubiquitous at next-generation light sources delivering many-fold increases in
coherent flux. The need for real-time feedback under accelerated acquisition
rates motivates surrogate reconstruction models like deep neural networks,
which offer orders-of-magnitude speedup over conventional methods. However,
existing deep learning approaches lack robustness across diverse experimental
conditions. We propose an unsupervised training workflow emphasizing probe
learning by combining experimentally-measured probes with synthetic,
procedurally generated objects. This probe-centric approach enables a single
physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across
multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe
generalization. We find probe learning is equally important as in-distribution
learning; models trained using this synthetic workflow achieve reconstruction
fidelity comparable to those trained exclusively on experimental data, even
when changing the type of synthetic training object. The proposed approach
enables training of experiment-steering models that provide real-time feedback
under dynamic experimental conditions.

TL;DR: SIREN通过选择性熵正则化解决了RLVR中的熵崩溃和过早收敛问题，提升了大型推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化方法在大型推理模型中因动作空间大和轨迹长导致全局熵爆炸，无法有效探索。

Method: 提出SIREN方法，通过两步熵掩码机制（top-p掩码和峰值熵掩码）限制探索范围，并采用自锚定正则化稳定训练。

Result: 在五个数学基准测试中，SIREN表现优于现有方法，如AIME24/25上提升6.6 maj@k，同时保持响应多样性和适当熵水平。

Conclusion: SIREN有效缓解了RLVR中常见的过早收敛问题，提升了模型训练的稳定性和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise
in enhancing the reasoning abilities of large reasoning models (LRMs). However,
it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence.
Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in
the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of
LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space
and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion
as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To
address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method
that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN
achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a
top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed
into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical
benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous
entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on
AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes
greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which
helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training. This effectively
mitigates the premature convergence problem common in RLVR for LRM.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个学习理论框架（Online Learning in the Replay Setting），用于研究机器学习系统在自我标注数据中可能强化错误的问题。通过引入Extended Threshold dimension（ExThD），证明了它是该模型中学习能力的精确度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器学习系统在自我标注数据中可能形成“回声室效应”的问题，即系统可能不断强化自身的错误。

Method: 提出了一个在线学习框架，其中学习者每轮输出一个假设，对手可以选择揭示真实标签或回放早期标签。通过引入ExThD维度，设计了闭包型学习算法。

Result: 证明了ExThD是该模型中学习能力的精确度量，闭包型学习算法最多犯ExThD次错误。对于随机对手，类似结果适用于所有交集闭包类。

Conclusion: 回放设置比经典错误界限设置更难学习，某些类在ExThD下可能无限大。此外，仅当类几乎交集闭包时，才能实现适当学习。

Abstract: As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they
risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We
model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online
Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis
$\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\ast(x_t)$ or
a replayed label $\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is
counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the
SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors.
  We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$,
and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model.
A closure-based learner makes at most $\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ mistakes
against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For
stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed
class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound
setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper
separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is
(almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers
$\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the
$\mathrm{ExThD}(\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight
analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for
closure-type algorithms.

Motivation: 传统神经网络压缩方法需要昂贵的微调或搜索过程，难以在普通硬件上实现。

Method: 提出激活感知因子分解框架和预算秩分配器，支持灵活控制压缩目标。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上验证了有效性，例如ResNeXt-101的FLOPs减少45%，精度仅下降1%。

Conclusion: BALF在无需微调的情况下实现了高效的模型压缩。

Abstract: Neural network compression techniques typically require expensive fine-tuning
or search procedures, rendering them impractical on commodity hardware.
Inspired by recent LLM compression research, we present a general
activation-aware factorization framework that can be applied to a broad range
of layers. Moreover, we introduce a scalable budgeted rank allocator that
allows flexible control over compression targets (e.g., retaining 50% of
parameters) with no overhead. Together, these components form BALF, an
efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate
its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on
CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it
achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF
reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1
accuracy drop.

Motivation: 探索注意力机制在稀疏标记分类中的表现，特别是在检测微弱信号时的能力。

Method: 使用稀疏标记分类模型，比较单层注意力分类器和线性分类器的表现，并通过理论分析和高维训练研究。

Conclusion: 注意力机制通过自适应标记选择，显著优于非自适应线性基线，展示了其在处理稀疏特征时的优势。

Abstract: When and how can an attention mechanism learn to selectively attend to
informative tokens, thereby enabling detection of weak, rare, and sparsely
located features? We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token
classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a
randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In
the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention
classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal
strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear
classifiers require $\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to
learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime,
where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that
just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention
classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing
an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further
derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of
the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the
largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby
explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear
baselines.

Motivation: 生成模型在合成复杂数据分布的高保真样本时，常违反物理定律或任务规范的硬约束，现有方法（如重复投影）会扭曲学习分布或增加算法复杂度。

Method: 提出Chance-constrained Flow Matching (CCFM)，将随机优化融入采样过程，确保硬约束的同时避免分布失真。

Result: CCFM在复杂物理系统和分子对接问题中表现优于现有方法，提供更高的可行性和保真度。

Conclusion: CCFM是一种高效且理论等效的约束生成方法，解决了现有技术的局限性。

Abstract: Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex
data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from
physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project
intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can
distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold.
Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean
samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and
accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by
proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching
(CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process,
enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining
high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in
the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating
directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to
projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a
sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show
that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in
modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations
and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.

Conclusion: 研究为现代电网中可靠电压预测的模型假设提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Voltage prediction in distribution grids is a critical yet difficult task for
maintaining power system stability. Machine learning approaches, particularly
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer significant speedups but suffer from poor
generalization when trained on limited or incomplete data. In this work, we
systematically investigate the role of inductive biases in improving a model's
ability to reliably learn power flow. Specifically, we evaluate three
physics-informed strategies: (i) power-flow-constrained loss functions, (ii)
complex-valued neural networks, and (iii) residual-based task reformulation.
Using the ENGAGE dataset, which spans multiple low- and medium-voltage grid
configurations, we conduct controlled experiments to isolate the effect of each
inductive bias and assess both standard predictive performance and
out-of-distribution generalization. Our study provides practical insights into
which model assumptions most effectively guide learning for reliable and
efficient voltage prediction in modern distribution networks.

Result: 在大规模文本到图像模型中，GLASS Flows消除了随机演化与效率之间的权衡，结合Feynman-Kac Steering提升了性能。

Conclusion: GLASS Flows是一种简单、即插即用的解决方案，显著提升了流和扩散模型在推理时的性能。

Abstract: The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved
at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a
major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a
common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many
algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is
significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To
remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that
simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov
transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be
retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the
efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale
text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between
stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS
Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making
it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion
models.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with stochastic optimal control offers a promising
framework for diffusion fine-tuning, where a pre-trained diffusion model is
optimized to generate paths that lead to a reward-tilted distribution. While
these approaches enable optimization without access to explicit samples from
the optimal distribution, they require training on rollouts under the current
fine-tuned model, making them susceptible to reinforcing sub-optimal
trajectories that yield poor rewards. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion
(TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion
trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware
fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under
a stochastic optimal control objective. We validate our framework on single-
and multi-objective fine-tuning of biological sequence diffusion models,
highlighting the overall effectiveness of TR2-D2 for reliable reward-guided
fine-tuning in discrete sequence generation.

Abstract: Sample efficiency is a central property of effective deep reinforcement
learning algorithms. Recent work has improved this through added complexity,
such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex
algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance. We
take a more principled approach by focusing on the optimization landscape of
the critic network. Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the
critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common
architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that
a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and
a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of
magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds
gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning
rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights,
we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic
algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware
principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55
proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using
significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.

Abstract: We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved
Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models
(LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies
have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them
often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this
trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates
between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically
adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase
cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable
decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens
and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length
limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon
settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the
model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily
pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency
trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves
performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three
iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other
methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically
oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically
balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal
"sweet spot" between the two. Our models are publicly available.
