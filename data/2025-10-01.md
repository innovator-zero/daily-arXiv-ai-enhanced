### [1] [LUMA: Low-Dimension Unified Motion Alignment with Dual-Path Anchoring for Text-to-Motion Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25304)
*Haozhe Jia,Wenshuo Chen,Yuqi Lin,Yang Yang,Lei Wang,Mang Ning,Bowen Tian,Songning Lai,Nanqian Jia,Yifan Chen,Yutao Yue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LUMA是一种基于双路径锚定的文本到运动扩散模型，通过增强语义对齐和减少运动伪影，实现了高性能和高效率的运动生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于U-Net的扩散模型在文本到运动生成任务中存在语义不对齐和运动伪影问题，深层网络的梯度衰减是主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出LUMA模型，结合轻量级MoCLIP模型（提供时间域语义监督）和低频DCT组件（提供频域对齐信号），通过时间调制机制自适应融合。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上达到SOTA性能（FID分别为0.035和0.123），收敛速度提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: LUMA通过双路径锚定机制有效解决了语义对齐和梯度衰减问题，为高保真文本到运动生成提供了高效可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: While current diffusion-based models, typically built on U-Net architectures,
have shown promising results on the text-to-motion generation task, they still
suffer from semantic misalignment and kinematic artifacts. Through analysis, we
identify severe gradient attenuation in the deep layers of the network as a key
bottleneck, leading to insufficient learning of high-level features. To address
this issue, we propose \textbf{LUMA} (\textit{\textbf{L}ow-dimension
\textbf{U}nified \textbf{M}otion \textbf{A}lignment}), a text-to-motion
diffusion model that incorporates dual-path anchoring to enhance semantic
alignment. The first path incorporates a lightweight MoCLIP model trained via
contrastive learning without relying on external data, offering semantic
supervision in the temporal domain. The second path introduces complementary
alignment signals in the frequency domain, extracted from low-frequency DCT
components known for their rich semantic content. These two anchors are
adaptively fused through a temporal modulation mechanism, allowing the model to
progressively transition from coarse alignment to fine-grained semantic
refinement throughout the denoising process. Experimental results on HumanML3D
and KIT-ML demonstrate that LUMA achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
FID scores of 0.035 and 0.123, respectively. Furthermore, LUMA accelerates
convergence by 1.4$\times$ compared to the baseline, making it an efficient and
scalable solution for high-fidelity text-to-motion generation.

### [2] [VisualOverload: Probing Visual Understanding of VLMs in Really Dense Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25339)
*Paul Gavrikov,Wei Lin,M. Jehanzeb Mirza,Soumya Jahagirdar,Muhammad Huzaifa,Sivan Doveh,Serena Yeung-Levy,James Glass,Hilde Kuehne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisualOverload是一个新的VQA基准测试，挑战现有视觉语言模型在密集场景中的表现，发现其性能被高估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证当前视觉语言模型在密集场景中的实际能力，揭示其局限性。

Method: 构建包含2,720个问题的数据集，基于高分辨率公共领域绘画，手动标注六类任务。

Result: 最佳模型仅达到19.6%的准确率（最难测试集），整体69.5%，显示模型在细节推理上的不足。

Conclusion: VisualOverload揭示了当前视觉模型的重大缺陷，为改进提供了关键资源。

Abstract: Is basic visual understanding really solved in state-of-the-art VLMs? We
present VisualOverload, a slightly different visual question answering (VQA)
benchmark comprising 2,720 question-answer pairs, with privately held
ground-truth responses. Unlike prior VQA datasets that typically focus on near
global image understanding, VisualOverload challenges models to perform simple,
knowledge-free vision tasks in densely populated (or, overloaded) scenes. Our
dataset consists of high-resolution scans of public-domain paintings that are
populated with multiple figures, actions, and unfolding subplots set against
elaborately detailed backdrops. We manually annotated these images with
questions across six task categories to probe for a thorough understanding of
the scene. We hypothesize that current benchmarks overestimate the performance
of VLMs, and encoding and reasoning over details is still a challenging task
for them, especially if they are confronted with densely populated scenes.
Indeed, we observe that even the best model (o3) out of 37 tested models only
achieves 19.6% accuracy on our hardest test split and overall 69.5% accuracy on
all questions. Beyond a thorough evaluation, we complement our benchmark with
an error analysis that reveals multiple failure modes, including a lack of
counting skills, failure in OCR, and striking logical inconsistencies under
complex tasks. Altogether, VisualOverload exposes a critical gap in current
vision models and offers a crucial resource for the community to develop better
models.

### [3] [Editing Physiological Signals in Videos Using Latent Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25348)
*Tianwen Zhou,Akshay Paruchuri,Josef Spjut,Kaan Akşit*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种学习框架，用于编辑视频中的生理信号（如心率）同时保持视觉保真度，以解决隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于摄像头的心率估计可能泄露敏感健康信息，引发隐私担忧。

Method: 使用预训练的3D VAE和文本编码器，结合AdaLN和FiLM技术，实现生理信号的精确调制。

Result: 在视觉质量（PSNR 38.96 dB，SSIM 0.98）和心率调制误差（MAE 10.00 bpm，MAPE 10.09%）上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法可用于匿名化生物信号或合成具有目标生命体征的真实视频。

Abstract: Camera-based physiological signal estimation provides a non-contact and
convenient means to monitor Heart Rate (HR). However, the presence of vital
signals in facial videos raises significant privacy concerns, as they can
reveal sensitive personal information related to the health and emotional
states of an individual. To address this, we propose a learned framework that
edits physiological signals in videos while preserving visual fidelity. First,
we encode an input video into a latent space via a pretrained 3D Variational
Autoencoder (3D VAE), while a target HR prompt is embedded through a frozen
text encoder. We fuse them using a set of trainable spatio-temporal layers with
Adaptive Layer Normalizations (AdaLN) to capture the strong temporal coherence
of remote Photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals. We apply Feature-wise Linear
Modulation (FiLM) in the decoder with a fine-tuned output layer to avoid the
degradation of physiological signals during reconstruction, enabling accurate
physiological modulation in the reconstructed video. Empirical results show
that our method preserves visual quality with an average PSNR of 38.96 dB and
SSIM of 0.98 on selected datasets, while achieving an average HR modulation
error of 10.00 bpm MAE and 10.09% MAPE using a state-of-the-art rPPG estimator.
Our design's controllable HR editing is useful for applications such as
anonymizing biometric signals in real videos or synthesizing realistic videos
with desired vital signs.

### [4] [SpinBench: Perspective and Rotation as a Lens on Spatial Reasoning in VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25390)
*Yuyou Zhang,Radu Corcodel,Chiori Hori,Anoop Cherian,Ding Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpinBench是一个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）空间推理能力的诊断基准，揭示了模型在视角转换中的系统性弱点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计SpinBench是为了评估VLMs在空间推理中的核心挑战——视角转换能力，包括多认知能力的综合测试。

Method: 通过细粒度诊断类别（如平移、旋转、对象相对姿态和视角变化）逐步构建任务，从简单单对象任务到复杂多对象视角转换。

Result: 评估37个先进VLMs，发现其存在强烈的自我中心偏差、旋转理解差、对称和句法重构不一致等问题。人类准确率高达91.2%，且任务难度与VLM准确率相关。

Conclusion: SpinBench为VLMs的空间推理能力提供了关键见解，并凸显了其在物理空间推理中的主要不足。

Abstract: We present SpinBench, a cognitively grounded diagnostic benchmark for
evaluating spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs). SpinBench is
designed around the core challenge of spatial reasoning: perspective taking,
the ability to reason about how scenes and object relations change under
viewpoint transformation. Since perspective taking requires multiple cognitive
capabilities, such as recognizing objects across views, relative positions
grounding, and mentally simulating transformations, SpinBench introduces a set
of fine-grained diagnostic categories. Our categories target translation,
rotation, object relative pose, and viewpoint change, and are progressively
structured so that single-object simpler tasks scaffold toward the most
demanding multi-object perspective-taking setting. We evaluate 37
state-of-the-art VLMs, both proprietary and open source. Results reveal
systematic weaknesses: strong egocentric bias, poor rotational understanding,
and inconsistencies under symmetrical and syntactic reformulations. Scaling
analysis shows both smooth improvements and emergent capabilities. While human
subjects achieve high accuracy (91.2\%), task difficulty as measured by human
response time shows strong correlation with VLM accuracy, indicating that
SpinBench captures spatial reasoning challenges shared across humans and VLMs.
We believe SpinBench provides critical insights into spatial reasoning in VLMs
and highlights key gaps in their ability to reason about physical space. Our

### [5] [A Deep Learning Approach for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of InSAR Ground Deformation in Eastern Ireland](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25393)
*Wendong Yao,Binhua Huang,Soumyabrata Dev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态时空Transformer（MM-STT）框架，通过融合动态位移数据和静态物理先验，显著提升了高分辨率地面沉降预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如ConvLSTM）难以建模长程依赖关系，且局限于单模态数据范式，限制了预测性能。

Method: 设计了多模态时空Transformer（MM-STT），采用联合时空注意力机制统一处理多模态特征。

Result: 在EGMS数据集上，MM-STT将长程预测的RMSE降低了一个数量级，超越了STGCN和STAEformer等SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 对于此类问题，架构的多模态深度融合能力是实现突破性性能的关键。

Abstract: Forecasting high-resolution land subsidence is a critical yet challenging
task due to its complex, non-linear dynamics. While standard architectures like
ConvLSTM often fail to model long-range dependencies, we argue that a more
fundamental limitation of prior work lies in the uni-modal data paradigm. To
address this, we propose the Multi-Modal Spatio-Temporal Transformer (MM-STT),
a novel framework that fuses dynamic displacement data with static physical
priors. Its core innovation is a joint spatio-temporal attention mechanism that
processes all multi-modal features in a unified manner. On the public EGMS
dataset, MM-STT establishes a new state-of-the-art, reducing the long-range
forecast RMSE by an order of magnitude compared to all baselines, including
SOTA methods like STGCN and STAEformer. Our results demonstrate that for this
class of problems, an architecture's inherent capacity for deep multi-modal
fusion is paramount for achieving transformative performance.

### [6] [DepthLM: Metric Depth From Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25413)
*Zhipeng Cai,Ching-Feng Yeh,Hu Xu,Zhuang Liu,Gregory Meyer,Xinjie Lei,Changsheng Zhao,Shang-Wen Li,Vikas Chandra,Yangyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs通过文本交互处理视觉任务，但在3D理解上表现不佳。DepthLM方法通过视觉提示和增强，使VLMs在深度估计任务上达到专家级精度，无需复杂架构或损失函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在3D理解任务（如深度估计）上表现不足，而纯视觉模型虽准确但需特定架构。研究旨在探索VLMs是否能在不改动架构或损失函数的情况下达到专家级精度。

Method: 采用基于文本的监督微调和稀疏标签，结合视觉提示和相机参数增强，解决像素参考和跨数据集相机模糊问题。

Result: DepthLM方法使VLMs在深度估计任务上超越先进VLMs 2倍以上，首次与纯视觉模型媲美，且避免过平滑问题。

Conclusion: DepthLM的简洁性使单一VLM可覆盖多种3D任务，为VLMs在3D理解领域的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) can flexibly address various vision tasks
through text interactions. Although successful in semantic understanding,
state-of-the-art VLMs including GPT-5 still struggle in understanding 3D from
2D inputs. On the other hand, expert pure vision models achieve super-human
accuracy in metric depth estimation, a key 3D understanding task. However, they
require task-specific architectures and losses. Such difference motivates us to
ask: Can VLMs reach expert-level accuracy without architecture or loss change?
We take per-pixel metric depth estimation as the representative task and show
that the answer is yes! Surprisingly, comprehensive analysis shows that
text-based supervised-finetuning with sparse labels is sufficient for VLMs to
unlock strong 3D understanding, no dense prediction head or complex
regression/regularization loss is needed. The bottleneck for VLMs lies actually
in pixel reference and cross-dataset camera ambiguity, which we address through
visual prompting and intrinsic-conditioned augmentation. With much smaller
models, our method DepthLM surpasses the accuracy of most advanced VLMs by over
2x, making VLMs for the first time comparable with pure vision models.
Interestingly, without explicit enforcement during training, VLMs trained with
DepthLM naturally avoids over-smoothing, having much fewer flying points at
boundary regions than pure vision models. The simplicity of DepthLM also
enables a single VLM to cover various 3D tasks beyond metric depth. Our code
and model will be released at the link below.

### [7] [Bayesian Transformer for Pan-Arctic Sea Ice Concentration Mapping and Uncertainty Estimation using Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2 Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25437)
*Mabel Heffring,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯Transformer的新方法，用于高分辨率北极海冰浓度（SIC）制图和不确定性量化，结合了多种数据源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北极海冰高分辨率制图及其不确定性量化对海冰监测至关重要，但面临特征细微、模型不确定性和数据异质性等挑战。

Method: 设计了具有全局和局部模块的高分辨率Transformer模型，并扩展为贝叶斯版本以量化不确定性，同时融合了Sentinel-1、RCM和AMSR2数据。

Result: 在2021年9月的北极数据集上测试，模型能生成高分辨率SIC图和鲁棒的不确定性图，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了海冰制图中的关键挑战，为北极海冰监测提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Although high-resolution mapping of Pan-Arctic sea ice with reliable
corresponding uncertainty is essential for operational sea ice concentration
(SIC) charting, it is a difficult task due to some key challenges, e.g., the
subtle nature of ice signature features, model uncertainty, and data
heterogeneity. This letter presents a novel Bayesian Transformer approach for
Pan-Arctic SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification using Sentinel-1,
RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM), and Advanced Microwave Scanning
Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) data. First, to improve feature extraction, we design a
novel high-resolution Transformer model with both global and local modules that
can better discern the subtle differences in sea ice patterns. Second, to
improve uncertainty quantification, we design a Bayesian extension of the
proposed Transformer model, treating its parameters as random variables to more
effectively capture uncertainties. Third, to address data heterogeneity, we
fuse three different data types (Sentinel-1, RCM, and AMSR2) at decision-level
to improve both SIC mapping and uncertainty quantification. The proposed
approach is tested on Pan-Arctic datasets from September 2021, and the results
demonstrate that the proposed model can achieve both high-resolution SIC maps
and robust uncertainty maps compared to other uncertainty quantification
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过整合路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器，结合卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略，提出了一种可扩展、成本效益高的车辆检测和定位框架，显著提高了轨迹一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险路段（如施工区）中基础设施感知和实时轨迹生成面临的视角失真、复杂几何、遮挡和成本问题。

Method: 使用路边摄像头和LiDAR传感器，结合卡尔曼滤波的后期融合策略，开发车辆检测和定位框架。

Result: 仿真中融合算法将纵向误差减少高达70%，横向精度保持在1至3米内；现场验证显示融合轨迹与实际车辆路径高度匹配。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波传感器融合能可靠补偿单个传感器的局限性，为复杂交通环境中的主动安全措施提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Infrastructure-based sensing and real-time trajectory generation show promise
for improving safety in high-risk roadway segments such as work zones, yet
practical deployments are hindered by perspective distortion, complex geometry,
occlusions, and costs. This study tackles these barriers by integrating
roadside camera and LiDAR sensors into a cosimulation environment to develop a
scalable, cost-effective vehicle detection and localization framework, and
employing a Kalman Filter-based late fusion strategy to enhance trajectory
consistency and accuracy. In simulation, the fusion algorithm reduced
longitudinal error by up to 70 percent compared to individual sensors while
preserving lateral accuracy within 1 to 3 meters. Field validation in an active
work zone, using LiDAR, a radar-camera rig, and RTK-GPS as ground truth,
demonstrated that the fused trajectories closely match real vehicle paths, even
when single-sensor data are intermittent or degraded. These results confirm
that KF based sensor fusion can reliably compensate for individual sensor
limitations, providing precise and robust vehicle tracking capabilities. Our
approach thus offers a practical pathway to deploy infrastructure-enabled
multi-sensor systems for proactive safety measures in complex traffic
environments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新范式'先看后推理'，通过增强多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对伪造痕迹的感知能力，提升AI生成图像检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在检测AI生成图像时表现不佳，主要原因是视觉编码器对低层次信号不敏感，且微调数据与预训练分布不匹配。

Method: 提出Forensic-Chat助手和ExplainFake-Bench基准，通过增强模型对伪造痕迹的感知能力，实现可泛化、可解释的检测。

Result: 实验表明该方法在泛化性和解释性上表现优越。

Conclusion: '先看后推理'范式能有效提升MLLMs在图像伪造检测中的性能，同时保持对话能力。

Abstract: Detecting AI-generated images with multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
has gained increasing attention, due to their rich world knowledge,
common-sense reasoning, and potential for explainability. However, naively
applying those MLLMs for detection often leads to suboptimal performance. We
argue that the root of this failure lies in a fundamental mismatch: MLLMs are
asked to reason about fakes before they can truly see them. First, they do not
really see: existing MLLMs' vision encoders are primarily optimized for
semantic-oriented recognition rather than the perception of low-level signals,
leaving them insensitive to subtle forgery traces. Without access to reliable
perceptual evidence, the model grounds its judgment on incomplete and limited
visual observations. Second, existing finetuning data for detection typically
uses narrow, instruction-style formats, which diverge sharply from the diverse,
heterogeneous distributions seen in pretraining. In the absence of meaningful
visual cues, the model therefore exploits these linguistic shortcuts, resulting
in catastrophic forgetting of pretrained knowledge (even the basic dialogue
capabilities). In response, we advocate for a new paradigm: seeing before
reasoning. We propose that MLLMs should first be trained to perceive
artifacts-strengthening their artifact-aware visual perception-so that
subsequent reasoning is grounded in actual observations. We therefore propose
Forensic-Chat, a generalizable, explainable, and still-conversational (for
multi-round dialogue) assistant for fake image detection. We also propose
ExplainFake-Bench, a benchmark tailored for the evaluation of the MLLM's
explainability for image forensics from five key aspects. Extensive experiments
show its superiority of generalization and genuinely reliable explainability.

### [10] [DeepFake Detection in Dyadic Video Calls using Point of Gaze Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25503)
*Odin Kohler,Rahul Vijaykumar,Masudul H. Imtiaz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用视线追踪技术实时检测视频会议中深度伪造攻击的方法，准确率达82%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造技术被恶意用于实时视频会议钓鱼攻击，传统方法难以检测。

Method: 基于对话中视线模式的解释性特征构建模型，利用恶意演员的视线信息。

Result: 在自建数据集上达到82%的准确率。

Conclusion: 首次利用视线追踪技术检测深度伪造，为实时检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: With recent advancements in deepfake technology, it is now possible to
generate convincing deepfakes in real-time. Unfortunately, malicious actors
have started to use this new technology to perform real-time phishing attacks
during video meetings. The nature of a video call allows access to what the
deepfake is ``seeing,'' that is, the screen displayed to the malicious actor.
Using this with the estimated gaze from the malicious actors streamed video
enables us to estimate where the deepfake is looking on screen, the point of
gaze. Because the point of gaze during conversations is not random and is
instead used as a subtle nonverbal communicator, it can be used to detect
deepfakes, which are not capable of mimicking this subtle nonverbal
communication. This paper proposes a real-time deepfake detection method
adapted to this genre of attack, utilizing previously unavailable biometric
information. We built our model based on explainable features selected after
careful review of research on gaze patterns during dyadic conversations. We
then test our model on a novel dataset of our creation, achieving an accuracy
of 82\%. This is the first reported method to utilize point-of-gaze tracking
for deepfake detection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于边缘域的新型模板匹配算法，用于在硬件受限条件下实现鲁棒的6自由度物体姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决火星样本返回任务中机器人臂在低间隙条件下对多个物体进行精确定位的需求。

Method: 结合自定义渲染器和针对边缘域设计的新模板匹配度量，仅需低精度、无纹理3D模型输入。

Result: 在合成数据集、地球物理测试床和火星实地图像中均优于现有技术，计算和内存效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用硬件上的低成本、可靠定位提供了新可能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of vision-based 6-DoF object pose estimation in the
context of the notional Mars Sample Return campaign, in which a robotic arm
would need to localize multiple objects of interest for low-clearance pickup
and insertion, under severely constrained hardware. We propose a novel
localization algorithm leveraging a custom renderer together with a new
template matching metric tailored to the edge domain to achieve robust pose
estimation using only low-fidelity, textureless 3D models as inputs. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic datasets as well as from physical testbeds on Earth
and in situ Mars imagery shows that our method consistently beats the state of
the art in compute and memory-constrained localization, both in terms of
robustness and accuracy, in turn enabling new possibilities for cheap and
reliable localization on general-purpose hardware.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLM-RG结合视觉语言模型和大语言模型，通过符号推理解决户外驾驶场景中的指代问题，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外驾驶场景中，由于场景多变、视觉相似物体多和动态元素复杂，自然语言指代（如“右边的黑色汽车”）的解析具有挑战性。

Method: LLM-RG结合视觉语言模型提取细粒度属性和大语言模型进行符号推理，通过生成视觉描述符和空间元数据，输入LLM进行链式推理以确定指代对象的边界框。

Result: 在Talk2Car基准测试中，LLM-RG显著优于基于LLM和VLM的基线方法，且3D空间线索进一步提升了性能。

Conclusion: LLM-RG展示了视觉语言模型和大语言模型在零样本情况下的互补优势，适用于户外指代任务。

Abstract: Referential grounding in outdoor driving scenes is challenging due to large
scene variability, many visually similar objects, and dynamic elements that
complicate resolving natural-language references (e.g., "the black car on the
right"). We propose LLM-RG, a hybrid pipeline that combines off-the-shelf
vision-language models for fine-grained attribute extraction with large
language models for symbolic reasoning. LLM-RG processes an image and a
free-form referring expression by using an LLM to extract relevant object types
and attributes, detecting candidate regions, generating rich visual descriptors
with a VLM, and then combining these descriptors with spatial metadata into
natural-language prompts that are input to an LLM for chain-of-thought
reasoning to identify the referent's bounding box. Evaluated on the Talk2Car
benchmark, LLM-RG yields substantial gains over both LLM and VLM-based
baselines. Additionally, our ablations show that adding 3D spatial cues further
improves grounding. Our results demonstrate the complementary strengths of VLMs
and LLMs, applied in a zero-shot manner, for robust outdoor referential
grounding.

### [13] [VISOR++: Universal Visual Inputs based Steering for Large Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25533)
*Ravikumar Balakrishnan,Mansi Phute*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR++通过优化的视觉输入实现多VLM的行为控制，无需运行时模型访问。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有行为控制方法存在局限性，如系统提示易被用户指令覆盖，激活向量需侵入式访问模型内部。VISOR++旨在通过视觉输入实现通用行为控制。

Method: 生成通用视觉输入（VISOR++图像），诱导目标激活模式，适用于多VLM。

Result: VISOR++图像在开放模型（如LLaVA-1.5-7B）上表现接近激活向量，且对未见模型（包括闭源模型）有效，同时保持其他任务性能。

Conclusion: VISOR++提供了一种无需模型访问的通用行为控制方法，适用于多种VLM。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) are deployed across safety-critical
applications, understanding and controlling their behavioral patterns has
become increasingly important. Existing behavioral control methods face
significant limitations: system prompting approaches could easily be overridden
by user instructions, while applying activation-based steering vectors requires
invasive runtime access to model internals, precluding deployment with
API-based services and closed-source models. Finding steering methods that
transfer across multiple VLMs is still an open area of research. To this end,
we introduce universal visual input based steering for output redirection
(VISOR++), to achieve behavioral control through optimized visual inputs alone.
We demonstrate that a single VISOR++ image can be generated for an ensemble of
VLMs to emulate each of their steering vectors. By crafting universal visual
inputs that induce target activation patterns, VISOR++ eliminates the need for
runtime model access while remaining deployment-agnostic. This means that when
an underlying model supports multimodal capability, model behaviors can be
steered by inserting an image input replacing runtime steering vector based
interventions. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the VISOR++ images on
open-access models such as LLaVA-1.5-7B and IDEFICS2-8B along three alignment
directions: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. Both the model-specific
steering images and the jointly optimized images achieve performance parity
closely following that of steering vectors for both positive and negative
steering tasks. We also show the promise of VISOR++ images in achieving
directional behavioral shifts for unseen models including both open-access and
closed-access ones. Furthermore, VISOR++ images are able to preserve 99.9%
performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU evaluation tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision-Zero是一个无需人工标注的自学习框架，通过视觉游戏提升视觉语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有强化学习方法依赖人工标注数据的高成本问题，推动视觉语言模型的实用化。

Method: 提出Vision-Zero框架，包含战略自玩、任意图像生成游戏和迭代自玩策略优化。

Result: 在多项任务中达到最先进性能，超越依赖标注的方法。

Conclusion: Vision-Zero展示了自学习框架在提升模型推理能力方面的潜力，且无需人工标注。

Abstract: Although reinforcement learning (RL) can effectively enhance the reasoning
capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs), current methods remain heavily
dependent on labor-intensive datasets that require extensive manual
construction and verification, leading to extremely high training costs and
consequently constraining the practical deployment of VLMs. To address this
challenge, we propose Vision-Zero, a domain-agnostic framework enabling VLM
self-improvement through competitive visual games generated from arbitrary
image pairs. Specifically, Vision-Zero encompasses three main attributes: (1)
Strategic Self-Play Framework: Vision-Zero trains VLMs in "Who Is the
Spy"-style games, where the models engage in strategic reasoning and actions
across multiple roles. Through interactive gameplay, models autonomously
generate their training data without human annotation. (2) Gameplay from
Arbitrary Images: Unlike existing gamified frameworks, Vision-Zero can generate
games from arbitrary images, thereby enhancing the model's reasoning ability
across diverse domains and showing strong generalization to different tasks. We
demonstrate this versatility using three distinct types of image datasets:
CLEVR-based synthetic scenes, charts, and real-world images. (3) Sustainable
Performance Gain: We introduce Iterative Self-Play Policy Optimization
(Iterative-SPO), a novel training algorithm that alternates between Self-Play
and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), mitigating the
performance plateau often seen in self-play-only training and achieving
sustained long-term improvements. Despite using label-free data, Vision-Zero

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉络膜痣可能恶变为黑色素瘤，早期诊断至关重要，但现有AI方法因数据质量差和标注不一致而受限。

Method: 结合数学/聚类模型与U-Net的混合方法，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖。

Result: 在1024*1024眼底图像上达到Dice系数89.7%和IoU 80.01%，优于Attention U-Net。

Abstract: Choroidal nevi are common benign pigmented lesions in the eye, with a small
risk of transforming into melanoma. Early detection is critical to improving
survival rates, but misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can lead to poor
outcomes. Despite advancements in AI-based image analysis, diagnosing choroidal
nevi in colour fundus images remains challenging, particularly for clinicians
without specialized expertise. Existing datasets often suffer from low
resolution and inconsistent labelling, limiting the effectiveness of
segmentation models. This paper addresses the challenge of achieving precise
segmentation of fundus lesions, a critical step toward developing robust
diagnostic tools. While deep learning models like U-Net have demonstrated
effectiveness, their accuracy heavily depends on the quality and quantity of
annotated data. Previous mathematical/clustering segmentation methods, though
accurate, required extensive human input, making them impractical for medical
applications. This paper proposes a novel approach that combines
mathematical/clustering segmentation models with insights from U-Net,
leveraging the strengths of both methods. This hybrid model improves accuracy,
reduces the need for large-scale training data, and achieves significant
performance gains on high-resolution fundus images. The proposed model achieves
a Dice coefficient of 89.7% and an IoU of 80.01% on 1024*1024 fundus images,
outperforming the Attention U-Net model, which achieved 51.3% and 34.2%,
respectively. It also demonstrated better generalizability on external
datasets. This work forms a part of a broader effort to develop a decision
support system for choroidal nevus diagnosis, with potential applications in
automated lesion annotation to enhance the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and
monitoring.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive
cross-domain capabilities, yet their proficiency in specialized scientific
fields like marine biology remains underexplored. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs and reveal significant
limitations in their ability to perform fine-grained recognition of fish
species, with the best open-source models achieving less than 10\% accuracy.
This task is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems under anthropogenic
pressure. To address this gap and investigate whether these failures stem from
a lack of domain knowledge, we introduce FishNet++, a large-scale, multimodal
benchmark. FishNet++ significantly extends existing resources with 35,133
textual descriptions for multimodal learning, 706,426 key-point annotations for
morphological studies, and 119,399 bounding boxes for detection. By providing
this comprehensive suite of annotations, our work facilitates the development

aquatic science.

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上达到SOTA性能，下游任务（如目标检测和语义分割）表现优秀且高效。

Conclusion: AttentionViG在性能和效率上均优于现有视觉图神经网络架构。

Abstract: Vision Graph Neural Networks (ViGs) have demonstrated promising performance
in image recognition tasks against Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and
Vision Transformers (ViTs). An essential part of the ViG framework is the
node-neighbor feature aggregation method. Although various graph convolution
methods, such as Max-Relative, EdgeConv, GIN, and GraphSAGE, have been
explored, a versatile aggregation method that effectively captures complex
node-neighbor relationships without requiring architecture-specific refinements
is needed. To address this gap, we propose a cross-attention-based aggregation
method in which the query projections come from the node, while the key
projections come from its neighbors. Additionally, we introduce a novel
architecture called AttentionViG that uses the proposed cross-attention
aggregation scheme to conduct non-local message passing. We evaluated the image
recognition performance of AttentionViG on the ImageNet-1K benchmark, where it
achieved SOTA performance. Additionally, we assessed its transferability to
downstream tasks, including object detection and instance segmentation on MS
COCO 2017, as well as semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed method not only achieves strong performance, but also
maintains efficiency, delivering competitive accuracy with comparable FLOPs to
prior vision GNN architectures.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分析中标注数据稀缺问题，研究广义少样本分类场景。

Conclusion: 广义少样本分类在医学图像分析中可行，迁移学习方法表现更优，高效模型架构可平衡性能与资源需求。

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data presents a major challenge for
applying deep learning methods to medical image analysis. Few-shot learning
methods aim to recognize new classes from only a small number of labeled
examples. These methods are typically studied under the standard few-shot
learning setting, where all classes in a task are new. However, medical
applications such as pathology classification from chest X-rays often require
learning new classes while simultaneously leveraging knowledge of previously
known ones, a scenario more closely aligned with generalized few-shot
classification. Despite its practical relevance, few-shot learning has been
scarcely studied in this context. In this work, we present MetaChest, a
large-scale dataset of 479,215 chest X-rays collected from four public
databases. MetaChest includes a meta-set partition specifically designed for
standard few-shot classification, as well as an algorithm for generating
multi-label episodes. We conduct extensive experiments evaluating both a
standard transfer learning approach and an extension of ProtoNet across a wide
range of few-shot multi-label classification tasks. Our results demonstrate
that increasing the number of classes per episode and the number of training
examples per class improves classification performance. Notably, the transfer
learning approach consistently outperforms the ProtoNet extension, despite not
being tailored for few-shot learning. We also show that higher-resolution
images improve accuracy at the cost of additional computation, while efficient
model architectures achieve comparable performance to larger models with
significantly reduced resource requirements.

Motivation: 现有医学图像分割模型通常针对单一任务或模态，与临床实践中专家整合多种知识的需求不符。

Method: K-Prism通过双提示表示（1-D稀疏提示和2-D密集提示）和MoE解码器，动态整合语义先验、上下文知识和交互反馈。

Result: 在18个公共数据集上的实验表明，K-Prism在语义、上下文和交互分割任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: K-Prism通过统一框架有效整合多种知识范式，为医学图像分割提供了灵活且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet
existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge
sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This
fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts
seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training,
exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through
real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation
framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating
three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from
annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot
reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs
like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge
sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts
defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating
$\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching
between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural
modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse
modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that
K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and
interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 人类感知具有主动聚焦特性，需要局部高分辨率重建以支持细节检查，而现有方法要么计算成本高，要么需要密集观测和长时间优化。

Method: 提出GaussianLens框架，利用初始3DGS和多视图图像的多模态信息，设计像素引导的密集化机制。

Result: 实验表明该方法在局部细节重建上表现优异，支持高达1024×1024分辨率图像。

Conclusion: GaussianLens有效平衡了全局低成本和局部高细节需求，为按需高分辨率重建提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We perceive our surroundings with an active focus, paying more attention to
regions of interest, such as the shelf labels in a grocery store. When it comes
to scene reconstruction, this human perception trait calls for spatially
varying degrees of detail ready for closer inspection in critical regions,
preferably reconstructed on demand. While recent works in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) achieve fast, generalizable reconstruction from sparse views, their
uniform resolution output leads to high computational costs unscalable to
high-resolution training. As a result, they cannot leverage available images at
their original high resolution to reconstruct details. Per-scene optimization
methods reconstruct finer details with adaptive density control, yet require
dense observations and lengthy offline optimization. To bridge the gap between
the prohibitive cost of high-resolution holistic reconstructions and the user
needs for localized fine details, we propose the problem of localized
high-resolution reconstruction via on-demand Gaussian densification. Given a
low-resolution 3DGS reconstruction, the goal is to learn a generalizable
network that densifies the initial 3DGS to capture fine details in a
user-specified local region of interest (RoI), based on sparse high-resolution
observations of the RoI. This formulation avoids the high cost and redundancy
of uniformly high-resolution reconstructions and fully leverages
high-resolution captures in critical regions. We propose GaussianLens, a
feed-forward densification framework that fuses multi-modal information from
the initial 3DGS and multi-view images. We further design a pixel-guided
densification mechanism that effectively captures details under large
resolution increases. Experiments demonstrate our method's superior performance
in local fine detail reconstruction and strong scalability to images of up to
$1024\times1024$ resolution.

Abstract: Vision-threatening eye diseases pose a major global health burden, with
timely diagnosis limited by workforce shortages and restricted access to
specialized care. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise
for medical image interpretation, advancing MLLMs for ophthalmology is hindered
by the lack of comprehensive benchmark datasets suitable for evaluating
generative models. We present a large-scale multimodal ophthalmology benchmark
comprising 32,633 instances with multi-granular annotations across 12 common
ophthalmic conditions and 5 imaging modalities. The dataset integrates imaging,
anatomical structures, demographics, and free-text annotations, supporting
anatomical structure recognition, disease screening, disease staging, and
demographic prediction for bias evaluation. This work extends our preliminary
LMOD benchmark with three major enhancements: (1) nearly 50% dataset expansion
with substantial enlargement of color fundus photography; (2) broadened task
coverage including binary disease diagnosis, multi-class diagnosis, severity
classification with international grading standards, and demographic
prediction; and (3) systematic evaluation of 24 state-of-the-art MLLMs. Our
evaluations reveal both promise and limitations. Top-performing models achieved
~58% accuracy in disease screening under zero-shot settings, and performance
remained suboptimal for challenging tasks like disease staging. We will
publicly release the dataset, curation pipeline, and leaderboard to potentially
advance ophthalmic AI applications and reduce the global burden of
vision-threatening diseases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预定义的锚框，限制了灵活性。AFGeo旨在消除这种依赖，并通过建模点击点位置和跨视角关联，提升定位的鲁棒性。

Method: AFGeo直接预测每个像素到真实框的四个方向偏移，结合高斯位置编码（GPE）和跨视角物体关联模块（CVOAM）。

Result: AFGeo在基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，且模型轻量化、计算高效。

Conclusion: AFGeo通过无锚框设计和创新的模块集成，显著提升了跨视角物体地理定位的准确性和效率。

Abstract: Most existing cross-view object geo-localization approaches adopt
anchor-based paradigm. Although effective, such methods are inherently
constrained by predefined anchors. To eliminate this dependency, we first
propose an anchor-free formulation for cross-view object geo-localization,
termed AFGeo. AFGeo directly predicts the four directional offsets (left,
right, top, bottom) to the ground-truth box for each pixel, thereby localizing
the object without any predefined anchors. To obtain a more robust spatial
prior, AFGeo incorporates Gaussian Position Encoding (GPE) to model the click
point in the query image, mitigating the uncertainty of object position that
challenges object localization in cross-view scenarios. In addition, AFGeo
incorporates a Cross-view Object Association Module (CVOAM) that relates the
same object and its surrounding context across viewpoints, enabling reliable
localization under large cross-view appearance gaps. By adopting an anchor-free
localization paradigm that integrates GPE and CVOAM with minimal parameter
overhead, our model is both lightweight and computationally efficient,
achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets.

Motivation: 现有跨模态检索模型（如CLIP）在处理融合图像-文本模态的检索任务时性能下降，且传统方法需要精心设计数据集且泛化能力有限。

Result: 实验表明，GCL在多个基准（如M-BEIR、MMEB、CoVR）上显著提升了现有多模态检索模型的性能。

Conclusion: GCL是一种高效且无需额外数据标注的多模态检索性能提升方法。

Abstract: Despite their consistent performance improvements, cross-modal retrieval
models (e.g., CLIP) show degraded performances with retrieving keys composed of
fused image-text modality (e.g., Wikipedia pages with both images and text). To
address this critical challenge, multimodal retrieval has been recently
explored to develop a unified single retrieval model capable of retrieving keys
across diverse modality combinations. A common approach involves constructing
new composed sets of image-text triplets (e.g., retrieving a pair of image and
text given a query image). However, such an approach requires careful curation
to ensure the dataset quality and fails to generalize to unseen modality
combinations. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes Generalized
Contrastive Learning (GCL), a novel loss formulation that improves multimodal
retrieval performance without the burdensome need for new dataset curation.
Specifically, GCL operates by enforcing contrastive learning across all
modalities within a mini-batch, utilizing existing image-caption paired
datasets to learn a unified representation space. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of GCL by showing consistent performance improvements on
off-the-shelf multimodal retrieval models (e.g., VISTA, CLIP, and TinyCLIP)
using the M-BEIR, MMEB, and CoVR benchmarks.

Conclusion: 合成图像是可靠、低成本的训练数据源，可用于训练神经网络。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) traditionally require large amounts of
data to train models with good performance. However, data collection is an
expensive process, both in time and resources. Generated synthetic images are a
good alternative, with video games producing realistic 3D models. This paper
aims to determine whether images extracted from a video game can be effectively
used to train a CNN to detect real-life truck axles. Three different databases
were created, with real-life and synthetic trucks, to provide training and
testing examples for three different You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures.
Results were evaluated based on four metrics: recall, precision, F1-score, and
mean Average Precision (mAP). To evaluate the statistical significance of the
results, the Mann-Whitney U test was also applied to the resulting mAP of all
models. Synthetic images from trucks extracted from a video game proved to be a
reliable source of training data, contributing to the performance of all
networks. The highest mAP score reached 99\%. Results indicate that synthetic
images can be used to train neural networks, providing a reliable, low-cost
data source for extracting knowledge.

Motivation: 现有遥感图像描述研究缺乏对象级细粒度解释，限制了语义和结构信息的充分利用。

Method: 构建DE-Dataset数据集，提出DE-Benchmark评估套件，设计DescribeEarth模型（结合尺度自适应焦点策略和领域引导融合模块）。

Result: DescribeEarth模型在DE-Benchmark上优于现有通用MLLMs，尤其在对象特征和环境属性描述上表现突出。

Conclusion: Geo-DLC任务和DescribeEarth模型为遥感图像细粒度描述提供了有效解决方案，数据与模型已开源。

Abstract: Automated textual description of remote sensing images is crucial for
unlocking their full potential in diverse applications, from environmental
monitoring to urban planning and disaster management. However, existing studies
in remote sensing image captioning primarily focus on the image level, lacking
object-level fine-grained interpretation, which prevents the full utilization
and transformation of the rich semantic and structural information contained in
remote sensing images. To address this limitation, we propose Geo-DLC, a novel
task of object-level fine-grained image captioning for remote sensing. To
support this task, we construct DE-Dataset, a large-scale dataset contains 25
categories and 261,806 annotated instances with detailed descriptions of object
attributes, relationships, and contexts. Furthermore, we introduce
DE-Benchmark, a LLM-assisted question-answering based evaluation suite designed
to systematically measure model capabilities on the Geo-DLC task. We also
present DescribeEarth, a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) architecture
explicitly designed for Geo-DLC, which integrates a scale-adaptive focal
strategy and a domain-guided fusion module leveraging remote sensing
vision-language model features to encode high-resolution details and remote
sensing category priors while maintaining global context. Our DescribeEarth
model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art general MLLMs on DE-Benchmark,
demonstrating superior factual accuracy, descriptive richness, and grammatical
soundness, particularly in capturing intrinsic object features and surrounding
environmental attributes across simple, complex, and even out-of-distribution
remote sensing scenarios. All data, code and weights are released at

Result: YOLOv9+ConSinGAN准确率达91.3%，检测时间146ms，并集成到AOI系统中。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可推广至其他工业组件。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a YOLO-based deep learning (DL) model for automatic
defect detection to solve the time-consuming and labor-intensive tasks in
industrial manufacturing. In our experiments, the images of metal sheets are
used as the dataset for training the YOLO model to detect the defects on the
surfaces and in the holes of metal sheets. However, the lack of metal sheet
images significantly degrades the performance of detection accuracy. To address
this issue, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a considerable amount of data.
Four versions of the YOLO model (i.e., YOLOv3, v4, v7, and v9) are combined
with the ConSinGAN for data augmentation. The proposed YOLOv9 model with
ConSinGAN outperforms the other YOLO models with an accuracy of 91.3%, and a
detection time of 146 ms. The proposed YOLOv9 model is integrated into
manufacturing hardware and a supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA)
system to establish a practical automated optical inspection (AOI) system.
Additionally, the proposed automated defect detection is easily applied to
other components in industrial manufacturing.

Motivation: 解决AI生成图像检测和来源模型识别中的结构多样性和数据稀缺问题。

Method: 提出OmniDFA框架，结合开放集少样本源识别技术，并构建OmniFake数据集。

Result: OmniDFA在开放集识别和检测任务中表现出色，达到最先进的泛化性能。

Conclusion: OmniDFA为AI生成图像检测和来源识别提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: AI-generated image (AIGI) detection and source model attribution remain
central challenges in combating deepfake abuses, primarily due to the
structural diversity of generative models. Current detection methods are prone
to overfitting specific forgery traits, whereas source attribution offers a
robust alternative through fine-grained feature discrimination. However,
synthetic image attribution remains constrained by the scarcity of large-scale,
well-categorized synthetic datasets, limiting its practicality and
compatibility with detection systems. In this work, we propose a new paradigm
for image attribution called open-set, few-shot source identification. This
paradigm is designed to reliably identify unseen generators using only limited
samples, making it highly suitable for real-world application. To this end, we
introduce OmniDFA (Omni Detector and Few-shot Attributor), a novel framework
for AIGI that not only assesses the authenticity of images, but also determines
the synthesis origins in a few-shot manner. To facilitate this work, we
construct OmniFake, a large class-aware synthetic image dataset that curates
$1.17$ M images from $45$ distinct generative models, substantially enriching
the foundational resources for research on both AIGI detection and attribution.
Experiments demonstrate that OmniDFA exhibits excellent capability in open-set
attribution and achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance on AIGI
detection. Our dataset and code will be made available.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单的启发式方法构建多模态思维链，注意力图不可靠，选择策略被动且无目的，触发机制随意，无法有效捕捉模型的认知需求。

Method: AIMCoT包含三个组件：上下文增强的注意力图生成（CAG）、主动视觉探测（AVP）和动态注意力转移触发（DAT），分别解决注意力图不可靠、被动选择和触发机制问题。

Abstract: Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has emerged as a powerful technique for
enhancing the vision-language reasoning with interleaved information. However,
existing methods often rely on simplistic heuristics for constructing
interleaved CoT, typically depending on attention maps, which our empirical
analysis reveals can be unreliable. What's more, the shortcomings of their
passive and purposeless selection strategies and their arbitrary triggering
mechanisms in capturing the model's cognitive need for information are further
amplified. In this paper, we propose \textbf{AIMCoT}, an \textbf{A}ctive
\textbf{I}nformation-driven \textbf{M}ulti-modal
\textbf{C}hain-\textbf{o}f-\textbf{T}hought framework that addresses these
fundamental limitations. AIMCoT introduces three synergistic components: (1)
\textbf{Context-enhanced Attention-map Generation (CAG)}, which mitigates the
text-vision granularity imbalance, thereby producing more reliable attention
maps as a foundation. (2) \textbf{Active Visual Probing (AVP)}, which replaces
passive selection with a proactive, goal-oriented strategy grounded in
information theory to select image regions that help answer the questions
maximally. (3) \textbf{Dynamic Attention-shifting Trigger (DAT)}, which
intelligently determines the optimal moments to insert visual information by
monitoring the model's text-to-vision attention shifts. Extensive experiments
on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that AIMCoT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across different settings. By actively
foraging for information and dynamically structuring its reasoning process,
AIMCoT represents a critical step towards more robust, effective, and
human-like multimodal reasoning. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但会记忆训练数据，引发隐私和版权问题。本文通过分析潜在空间动态，揭示了记忆机制的核心是早期去噪过程中的过度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型记忆训练数据的原因和机制，以解决隐私和版权问题。

Method: 分析扩散和去噪过程，研究潜在空间动态，探讨记忆现象。

Result: 记忆由早期去噪中的过度估计驱动，导致多样性减少、去噪轨迹崩溃，并加速向记忆图像的收敛。

Conclusion: 早期过度估计是扩散模型中记忆现象的核心机制。

Abstract: Despite their success in image generation, diffusion models can memorize
training data, raising serious privacy and copyright concerns. Although prior
work has sought to characterize, detect, and mitigate memorization, the
fundamental question of why and how it occurs remains unresolved. In this
paper, we revisit the diffusion and denoising process and analyze latent space
dynamics to address the question: "How do diffusion models memorize?" We show
that memorization is driven by the overestimation of training samples during
early denoising, which reduces diversity, collapses denoising trajectories, and
accelerates convergence toward the memorized image. Specifically: (i)
memorization cannot be explained by overfitting alone, as training loss is
larger under memorization due to classifier-free guidance amplifying
predictions and inducing overestimation; (ii) memorized prompts inject training
images into noise predictions, forcing latent trajectories to converge and
steering denoising toward their paired samples; and (iii) a decomposition of
intermediate latents reveals how initial randomness is quickly suppressed and
replaced by memorized content, with deviations from the theoretical denoising
schedule correlating almost perfectly with memorization severity. Together,
these results identify early overestimation as the central underlying mechanism
of memorization in diffusion models.

*Yuan Gao,Sangwook Kim,Jianzhong You,Chris McIntosh*

TL;DR: ProbMED是一种多模态医学视觉语言预训练模型，通过概率对比学习改进多模态嵌入，优于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有医学视觉语言预训练模型未能直接处理多对多模态映射的问题。

Method: 使用概率对比学习，结合InfoNCE损失和Hellinger距离，统一四种模态的嵌入空间。

Result: 在13个医学数据集上表现优于现有模型，提升了跨模态检索和分类能力。

Conclusion: ProbMED在多模态医学决策中表现出色，改进了模态间的绑定和预测能力。

Abstract: Medical decision-making requires integrating diverse medical information,
from imaging to clinical narratives. These medical modalities are often
acquired in a many-to-many manner. However, current medical vision-language
pretraining models (Med-VLPMs) fail to directly account for this many-to-many
mapping in their model training and embeddings. To address this, we present
Probabilistic Modality-Enhanced Diagnosis (ProbMED), a multimodal Med-VLPM that
employs probabilistic contrastive learning to model distributions over
embeddings rather than deterministic estimates. ProbMED aligns four distinct
modalities--chest X-rays, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, and clinical
text--into a unified probabilistic embedding space. We use InfoNCE loss with
Hellinger distance to integrate inter-modality distributions. We introduce a
probabilistic synthetic sampling loss that captures modality-specific mean and
variance to improve intra-modality binding. Extensive experiments across 13
medical datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms current Med-VLPMs in
cross-modality retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification. We also
demonstrate the robust integration of multiple modalities for prognostication,
showing improved intra- and inter-medical modality binding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖简单的成对比较，无法捕捉多模态偏好的复杂性，导致优化偏差和幻觉问题。

Method: 利用CLIP空间嵌入和稀疏自编码器揭示语义偏差，基于重建难度、语义偏差和多样性选择负样本，采用Plackett-Luce目标和重要性采样策略。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，MISP-DPO显著优于现有方法，验证了多负样本采样的有效性。

Conclusion: MISP-DPO通过语义感知的多负样本采样，为多模态偏好学习提供了更广泛和更有信息的监督。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been extended from
text-only models to vision-language models. However, existing methods rely on
oversimplified pairwise comparisons, generating a single negative image via
basic perturbations or similarity-based retrieval, which fail to capture the
complex nature of multimodal preferences, inducing optimization bias and
hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose MISP-DPO, the first framework
to incorporate multiple, semantically diverse negative images in multimodal DPO
via the Plackett-Luce model. Our method embeds prompts and candidate images in
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) space and applies a sparse
autoencoder to uncover semantic deviations into interpretable factors. Negative
samples are selected based on reconstruction difficulty, semantic deviation
from the positive, and mutual diversity, yielding broader and more informative
supervision. To handle multi-negative comparisons, we adopt a Plackett-Luce
objective and introduce an importance sampling strategy that improves training
efficiency. Experiments across five diverse benchmarks demonstrate that
MISP-DPO consistently improves multimodal alignment over prior methods,
validating the effectiveness of semantic-aware, multi-negative sampling in
preference-based learning.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA，如SPED上Recall@1为98.9%，且仅用4096维全局描述符在SPED上实现100% Recall@10。

Conclusion: SAGE通过动态空间-视觉交互和高效训练策略，显著提升了视觉地点识别的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) requires robust retrieval of geotagged images
despite large appearance, viewpoint, and environmental variation. Prior methods
focus on descriptor fine-tuning or fixed sampling strategies yet neglect the
dynamic interplay between spatial context and visual similarity during
training. We present SAGE (Spatial-visual Adaptive Graph Exploration), a
unified training pipeline that enhances granular spatial-visual discrimination
by jointly improving local feature aggregation, organize samples during
training, and hard sample mining. We introduce a lightweight Soft Probing
module that learns residual weights from training data for patch descriptors
before bilinear aggregation, boosting distinctive local cues. During training
we reconstruct an online geo-visual graph that fuses geographic proximity and
current visual similarity so that candidate neighborhoods reflect the evolving
embedding landscape. To concentrate learning on the most informative place
neighborhoods, we seed clusters from high-affinity anchors and iteratively
expand them with a greedy weighted clique expansion sampler. Implemented with a
frozen DINOv2 backbone and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, SAGE achieves SOTA
across eight benchmarks. It attains 98.9%, 95.8%, 94.5%, and 96.0% Recall@1 on
SPED, Pitts30k-test, MSLS-val, and Nordland, respectively. Notably, our method
obtains 100% Recall@10 on SPED only using 4096D global descriptors. Code and

Motivation: 现有方法在处理精确属性控制和身份保持方面存在不足，尤其是在地标条件偏离源图像时。

Method: 提出LaTo方法，包括地标标记器、位置映射编码和地标预测器，利用视觉语言模型推断目标地标。

Result: LaTo在身份保持和语义一致性上分别优于现有方法7.8%和4.6%。

Conclusion: LaTo通过结构化方法显著提升了面部编辑的精确性和身份保持能力。

Abstract: Recent multimodal models for instruction-based face editing enable semantic
manipulation but still struggle with precise attribute control and identity
preservation. Structural facial representations such as landmarks are effective
for intermediate supervision, yet most existing methods treat them as rigid
geometric constraints, which can degrade identity when conditional landmarks
deviate significantly from the source (e.g., large expression or pose changes,
inaccurate landmark estimates). To address these limitations, we propose LaTo,
a landmark-tokenized diffusion transformer for fine-grained,
identity-preserving face editing. Our key innovations include: (1) a landmark
tokenizer that directly quantizes raw landmark coordinates into discrete facial
tokens, obviating the need for dense pixel-wise correspondence; (2) a
location-mapping positional encoding that integrates facial and image tokens
for unified processing, enabling flexible yet decoupled geometry-appearance
interactions with high efficiency and strong identity preservation; and (3) a
landmark predictor that leverages vision-language models to infer target
landmarks from instructions and source images, whose structured
chain-of-thought improves estimation accuracy and interactive control. To
mitigate data scarcity, we curate HFL-150K, to our knowledge the largest
benchmark for this task, containing over 150K real face pairs with fine-grained
instructions. Extensive experiments show that LaTo outperforms state-of-the-art
methods by 7.8% in identity preservation and 4.6% in semantic consistency. Code
and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Abstract: Video Object Segmentation (VOS) aims to track and segment specific objects
across entire video sequences, yet it remains highly challenging under complex
real-world scenarios. The MOSEv1 and LVOS dataset, adopted in the MOSEv1
challenge on LSVOS 2025, which is specifically designed to enhance the
robustness of VOS models in complex real-world scenarios, including long-term

remaining components are fine-tuned to preserve strong feature extraction
ability and improve segmentation accuracy. In the inference stage, we introduce
a pixel-check strategy that progressively refines predictions by exploiting
complementary strengths of multiple models, thereby yielding robust final
masks. As a result, our method achieves a J&F score of 86.37% on the test set,
ranking 1st in the MOSEv1 Challenge at LSVOS 2025. These results highlight the
effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges of VOS task in

Motivation: 现有方法在从2D观察中恢复3D人体姿态时存在模糊性，且概率方法在准确性和样本多样性之间存在权衡。

Method: 使用SO(3)扩散模型生成3D旋转参数的分布，结合条件丢弃和基于Transformer的分层结构学习。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效预测准确的姿态概率分布。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在生成多样且准确的3D姿态分布方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We tackle the problem of Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image,
formulating it as an image-conditioned human pose and shape generation. While
recovering 3D human pose from 2D observations is inherently ambiguous, most
existing approaches have regressed a single deterministic output. Probabilistic
methods attempt to address this by generating multiple plausible outputs to
model the ambiguity. However, these methods often exhibit a trade-off between
accuracy and sample diversity, and their single predictions are not competitive
with state-of-the-art deterministic models. To overcome these limitations, we
propose a novel approach that models well-aligned distribution to 2D
observations. In particular, we introduce $SO(3)$ diffusion model, which
generates the distribution of pose parameters represented as 3D rotations
unconditional and conditional to image observations via conditioning dropout.
Our model learns the hierarchical structure of human body joints using the
transformer. Instead of using transformer as a denoising model, the
time-independent transformer extracts latent vectors for the joints and a small
MLP-based denoising model learns the per-joint distribution conditioned on the
latent vector. We experimentally demonstrate and analyze that our model
predicts accurate pose probability distribution effectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拖拽式图像编辑方法主要在2D像素平面上操作，缺乏3D几何线索，导致在旋转和透视变换等场景中编辑效果不佳。

Method: 提出GeoDrag方法，通过统一的位移场结合3D几何和2D空间先验，并引入冲突无关的分区策略，实现高保真和结构一致的编辑。

Result: 实验表明，GeoDrag在多种编辑场景中表现出更高的精确性、结构一致性和多点编辑可靠性。

Conclusion: GeoDrag通过几何引导和分区策略，显著提升了拖拽式图像编辑的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Interactive point-based image editing serves as a controllable editor,
enabling precise and flexible manipulation of image content. However, most
drag-based methods operate primarily on the 2D pixel plane with limited use of
3D cues. As a result, they often produce imprecise and inconsistent edits,
particularly in geometry-intensive scenarios such as rotations and perspective
transformations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
geometry-guided drag-based image editing method - GeoDrag, which addresses
three key challenges: 1) incorporating 3D geometric cues into pixel-level
editing, 2) mitigating discontinuities caused by geometry-only guidance, and 3)
resolving conflicts arising from multi-point dragging. Built upon a unified
displacement field that jointly encodes 3D geometry and 2D spatial priors,
GeoDrag enables coherent, high-fidelity, and structure-consistent editing in a
single forward pass. In addition, a conflict-free partitioning strategy is
introduced to isolate editing regions, effectively preventing interference and
ensuring consistency. Extensive experiments across various editing scenarios
validate the effectiveness of our method, showing superior precision,
structural consistency, and reliable multi-point editability. The code will be
available on https://github.com/xinyu-pu/GeoDrag .

Motivation: 现有基于体积的室内场景重建方法依赖多视角几何约束，导致重建质量受视图密度影响大，在重叠和未观测区域表现差。

Method: 提出IPDRecon框架，包含像素级置信编码器（PCE）、仿射补偿模块（ACM）和图像平面空间解码器（IPSD），从单视角解码3D结构信息。

Result: 在ScanNetV2上，IPDRecon在视图减少40%时重建质量几乎不变，变异系数仅0.24%，性能保留率99.7%。

Conclusion: 利用单视角空间信息为实际应用中视图受限场景提供了鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Volume-based indoor scene reconstruction methods demonstrate significant
research value due to their superior generalization capability and real-time
deployment potential. However, existing methods rely on multi-view pixel
back-projection ray intersections as weak geometric constraints to determine
spatial positions, causing reconstruction quality to depend heavily on input
view density with poor performance in overlapping regions and unobserved areas.
To address these issues, the key lies in reducing dependency on inter-view
geometric constraints while exploiting rich spatial information within
individual views. We propose IPDRecon, an image-plane decoding framework
comprising three core components: Pixel-level Confidence Encoder (PCE), Affine
Compensation Module (ACM), and Image-Plane Spatial Decoder (IPSD). These
modules collaboratively decode 3D structural information encoded in 2D images
through physical imaging processes, effectively preserving spatial geometric
features including edges, hollow structures, and complex textures while
significantly enhancing view-invariant reconstruction. Experiments on ScanNetV2
confirm that IPDRecon achieves superior reconstruction stability, maintaining
nearly identical quality when view count reduces by 40%. The method achieves a
coefficient of variation of only 0.24%, performance retention rate of 99.7%,
and maximum performance drop of merely 0.42%. This demonstrates that exploiting
intra-view spatial information provides a robust solution for view-limited
scenarios in practical applications.

Abstract: We evaluate multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for topic-aligned

assess all seven modality combinations (T, A, V, TA, TV, AV, TAV) across five
topics: main recommendation, sentiment analysis, video purpose, visual
analysis, and financial entity recognition. Video alone performs strongly on
four of five topics, underscoring its value for capturing visual context and
effective cues such as emotions, gestures, and body language. Selective pairs
such as TV or AV often surpass TAV, implying that too many modalities may
introduce noise. These results establish the first baselines for financial

employs a three-stage training strategy: domain-specialized pretraining,

Motivation: 虚拟试穿需要精确对齐试穿区域的服装，同时保留非试穿区域的身份和背景。现有方法在处理非试穿区域时容易产生边界伪影和语义漂移。

Method: 将VITON重新表述为线性逆问题，采用轨迹对齐的求解器逐步增强测量一致性，并结合残差先验初始化和测量引导采样。

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和SHHQ-1.0数据集上，ART-VITON有效保留了身份和背景，消除了边界伪影，提升了视觉保真度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ART-VITON通过测量引导的扩散框架，显著改善了虚拟试穿的效果，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual try-on (VITON) aims to generate realistic images of a person wearing
a target garment, requiring precise garment alignment in try-on regions and
faithful preservation of identity and background in non-try-on regions. While
latent diffusion models (LDMs) have advanced alignment and detail synthesis,
preserving non-try-on regions remains challenging. A common post-hoc strategy
directly replaces these regions with original content, but abrupt transitions
often produce boundary artifacts. To overcome this, we reformulate VITON as a
linear inverse problem and adopt trajectory-aligned solvers that progressively
enforce measurement consistency, reducing abrupt changes in non-try-on regions.
However, existing solvers still suffer from semantic drift during generation,
leading to artifacts. We propose ART-VITON, a measurement-guided diffusion
framework that ensures measurement adherence while maintaining artifact-free
synthesis. Our method integrates residual prior-based initialization to
mitigate training-inference mismatch and artifact-free measurement-guided
sampling that combines data consistency, frequency-level correction, and
periodic standard denoising. Experiments on VITON-HD, DressCode, and SHHQ-1.0
demonstrate that ART-VITON effectively preserves identity and background,
eliminates boundary artifacts, and consistently improves visual fidelity and
robustness over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: TPO在多个基准测试中表现优于原始方法，提升了人类偏好评分和文本-图像对齐效果。

Conclusion: TPO是一种高效且可扩展的文本到图像对齐方法，无需依赖昂贵的标注数据。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models have led to
remarkable success in generating high-quality images from textual prompts.
However, ensuring accurate alignment between the text and the generated image
remains a significant challenge for state-of-the-art diffusion models. To
address this, existing studies employ reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) to align T2I outputs with human preferences. These methods,
however, either rely directly on paired image preference data or require a
learned reward function, both of which depend heavily on costly, high-quality
human annotations and thus face scalability limitations. In this work, we
introduce Text Preference Optimization (TPO), a framework that enables
"free-lunch" alignment of T2I models, achieving alignment without the need for
paired image preference data. TPO works by training the model to prefer matched
prompts over mismatched prompts, which are constructed by perturbing original
captions using a large language model. Our framework is general and compatible
with existing preference-based algorithms. We extend both DPO and KTO to our
setting, resulting in TDPO and TKTO. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
across multiple benchmarks show that our methods consistently outperform their
original counterparts, delivering better human preference scores and improved
text-to-image alignment. Our Open-source code is available at

verbal short videos, sourced from classic silent films and online resources,
and reflecting real-world scenarios where humor can be appreciated purely
through visual cues. Each video clip is paired with rich annotations, including
captions, descriptions, and explanations, supporting evaluation tasks like
caption matching and humor explanation. To broaden its applicability, we
further construct an open-ended video QA task, making it readily integrable
into existing video understanding benchmarks. We evaluate a diverse set of
MLLMs, from specialized Video-LLMs to versatile OmniLLMs that can process
audio, covering both open-source and proprietary domains. The experimental
results expose the difficulties MLLMs face in comprehending humor from visual
cues alone. For example, all models exhibit a marked performance drop on
caption matching when moving from text-based to video-based evaluation (without
audio). Our findings also demonstrate that incorporating audio helps with video
humor understanding, highlighting the informativeness of sound and the promise
of integrating richer modalities for complex video understanding tasks.

TL;DR: PCPO框架通过比例信用分配解决了T2I模型训练中的不稳定问题，显著提升了收敛速度和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在T2I模型训练中存在不稳定性和高方差问题，影响收敛速度和图像质量。

Method: 提出PCPO框架，通过稳定目标重构和时间步重新加权实现比例信用分配。

Result: PCPO显著加速收敛并提升图像质量，优于现有基线方法如DanceGRPO。

Conclusion: PCPO通过解决信用分配问题，有效提升了T2I模型的训练稳定性和生成质量。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image
(T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by
training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and
compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this
instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical
structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional
feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit
Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit
assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled
reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process,
leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality.
The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a
common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms
existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the
state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的噪声图反演技术ENM Inversion，用于文本引导的图像编辑，解决了现有方法在编辑灵活性和目标文本提示对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有噪声图反演方法在图像编辑中难以同时满足内容保留和目标文本提示的编辑灵活性。

Method: 提出ENM Inversion技术，通过搜索最优噪声图并引入可编辑噪声优化，确保内容保留和编辑灵活性。

Result: 实验表明ENM Inversion在图像和视频编辑任务中优于现有方法，实现了更好的内容保留和编辑保真度。

Conclusion: ENM Inversion是一种高效且灵活的噪声图反演方法，适用于多种编辑任务，并能扩展到视频编辑。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating
high-quality and diverse images. Building on these advancements, diffusion
models have also demonstrated exceptional performance in text-guided image
editing. A key strategy for effective image editing involves inverting the
source image into editable noise maps associated with the target image.
However, previous inversion methods face challenges in adhering closely to the
target text prompt. The limitation arises because inverted noise maps, while
enabling faithful reconstruction of the source image, restrict the flexibility
needed for desired edits. To overcome this issue, we propose Editable Noise Map
Inversion (ENM Inversion), a novel inversion technique that searches for
optimal noise maps to ensure both content preservation and editability. We
analyze the properties of noise maps for enhanced editability. Based on this
analysis, our method introduces an editable noise refinement that aligns with
the desired edits by minimizing the difference between the reconstructed and
edited noise maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ENM Inversion
outperforms existing approaches across a wide range of image editing tasks in
both preservation and edit fidelity with target prompts. Our approach can also
be easily applied to video editing, enabling temporal consistency and content
manipulation across frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvoQuality是一种无需人工标注的自监督框架，通过自一致性原则提升视觉语言模型在图像质量评估中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的人工标注数据，而自监督方法在感知领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用自一致性生成伪标签，通过GRPO迭代优化模型。

Result: 在7个IQA基准测试中，零样本性能提升31.8%，且优于5个监督模型。

Conclusion: EvoQuality展示了自监督方法在感知任务中的潜力，性能媲美甚至超越监督模型。

Abstract: Improving vision-language models (VLMs) in the post-training stage typically
relies on supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, methods that
necessitate costly, human-annotated data. While self-supervised techniques such
as self-consistency have proven effective for enhancing reasoning capabilities,
their application to perceptual domains such as image quality assessment (IQA)
remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce EvoQuality, a novel
framework that enables a VLM to autonomously refine its quality perception
capabilities without any ground-truth labels. EvoQuality adapts the principle
of self-consistency to the ranking-based nature of IQA. It generates
pseudo-labels by performing pairwise majority voting on the VLM's own outputs
to establish a consensus on relative quality. These pseudo-rankings are then
formulated into a fidelity reward that guides the model's iterative evolution
through group relative policy optimization (GRPO). By iteratively leveraging
its own predictions, EvoQuality progressively refines the VLM's perceptual
capability. Extensive experiments show that EvoQuality boosts the base VLM's
zero-shot performance by 31.8\% on PLCC across diverse IQA benchmarks.
Remarkably, despite being entirely self-supervised, EvoQuality achieves
performance that is competitive with, or even surpasses, state-of-the-art
supervised VLM-based IQA models, outperforming these models on 5 out of 7 IQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: EchoingECG是一种概率学生-教师模型，利用ECG嵌入和ECHO监督改进ECG预测心脏功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG成本低且易获取，但传统依赖复杂ECHO的心脏评估资源消耗大。研究旨在通过ECG预测ECHO结果，提高可及性。

Method: 结合PCME++概率对比框架和ECHO-CLIP视觉语言预训练模型，将ECHO知识蒸馏到ECG表示中。

Result: 在零样本、少样本和微调设置中，EchoingECG优于现有ECG模型，且方差估计提升了模型性能理解。

Conclusion: EchoingECG通过概率方法提升了ECG预测心脏功能的准确性，并识别了ECG中的不确定性区域。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) is a widely used tool for assessing cardiac function
due to its low cost and accessibility. Emergent research shows that ECGs can
help make predictions on key outcomes traditionally derived from more complex
modalities such as echocardiograms (ECHO), enabling the use of ECGs as a more
accessible method to predict broader measurements of cardiac function. ECHO, in
particular, are of great importance because they require considerable hospital
resources while playing a key role in clinical cardiac assessment. To aid this
use case, we introduce EchoingECG, a probabilistic student-teacher model that
leverages uncertainty-aware ECG embeddings and ECHO supervision to improve
ECG-based cardiac function prediction. Our approach integrates Probabilistic
Cross-Modal Embeddings (PCME++), a probabilistic contrastive framework, with
ECHO-CLIP, a vision-language pre-trained model trained on ECHO-text pairs, to
distill ECHO knowledge into ECG representations. Through experiments and
external validation, we showed that EchoingECG outperforms state-of-the-art
foundation ECG models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tune settings for ECHO
predictions based on ECG. We also highlighted that variance estimation (enabled
through our method) enhanced our understanding of model performance by
identifying underlying regions of uncertainty within ECGs. The code is

TL;DR: PIO 基准测试通过精确视觉定位系统评估 VLMs 的具身推理能力，发现通用模型在视觉定位中表现不如开源模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要通过选择题评估 VLMs 的具身推理能力，缺乏对精确视觉定位的系统性评估。

Method: 提出 PIO 基准测试，分三阶段（S1: 目标定位，S2: 任务驱动指向，S3: 视觉轨迹预测）评估 VLMs。

Result: 实验发现通用模型（如 GPT-4o）在视觉定位中表现较差，而某些开源模型（如 MoLMO）在 S1 和 S2 表现良好，但在 S3 中表现不佳。

Conclusion: PIO 基准测试揭示了 VLMs 在具身推理中的局限性，尤其是视觉轨迹规划方面的挑战。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive world knowledge
across a wide range of tasks, making them promising candidates for embodied
reasoning applications. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate the
embodied reasoning ability of VLMs through multiple-choice questions based on
image annotations -- for example, selecting which trajectory better describes
an event in the image. In this work, we introduce the Point-It-Out (PIO)
benchmark, a novel benchmark designed to systematically assess the embodied
reasoning abilities of VLMs through precise visual grounding. We propose a
hierarchical evaluation protocol spanning three stages (S1: referred-object
localization, S2: task-driven pointing, and S3: visual trace prediction), with
data collected from critical domains for embodied intelligence, including
indoor, kitchen, driving, and robotic manipulation scenarios. Extensive
experiments with over ten state-of-the-art VLMs reveal several interesting
findings. For example, strong general-purpose models such as GPT-4o, while
excelling on many benchmarks (e.g., language, perception, and reasoning),
underperform compared to some open-source models in precise visual grounding;
models such as MoLMO perform well in S1 and S2 but struggle in S3, where
requires grounding combined with visual trace planning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态相似性图适应（DSGA）模块，结合LoRA，用于在极端数据限制下优化SAM模型，实现农业环境中小密集物体的精确分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业计算机视觉任务中，基础模型的参数高效微调（PEFT）因数据有限和复杂田间条件而具有挑战性。

Method: 通过动态相似性图构建和自适应局部特征聚合，DSGA仅需4.00M可训练参数（原SAM的4.26%），并与LoRA结合形成互补优化框架。

Result: 在鹰嘴豆荚数据集上，DSGA+LoRA在多项指标上表现优异，结构度量提升17.31%，自适应F度量提升62.36%。

Conclusion: 该方法在农业自动监测中具有实用价值，实现了高精度的豆荚计数（R-squared为0.8987）。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models for agricultural
computer vision tasks remains challenging due to limited training data and
complex field conditions. This study introduces a Dynamic Similarity-based
Graph Adaptation (DSGA) module to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) under
extreme data constraints for precise foreground and instance segmentation of
small dense objects in complex agricultural environments. Through dynamic
similarity graph construction with a learnable polynomial decay-initialized
weight ranking mechanism and adaptive local feature aggregation, DSGA
establishes robust spatial and dynamic similarity representation with only
4.00M trainable parameters, which is 4.26% of the original SAM. Integrating
this graph-based feature adaptation with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) creates a
complementary optimization framework that effectively captures both local and
global dependencies in image embeddings while preserving model stability and
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on a challenging chickpea pod
dataset demonstrated that DSGA with LoRA achieved superior performance across
multiple metrics evaluated under 2, 4, 8 and 10 shots, with progressive
performance gains as shot count increased. Quantitative metrics showed a 17.31%
improvement in Structure-measure and a 62.36% gain in adaptive F-measure
compared to the baseline SAM fine-tuning. Comprehensive ablation studies and
visualization analyses through Grad-CAM and t-SNE validated the framework's
effectiveness in feature discrimination. The proposed adaptation demonstrated
practical utility for automated agricultural monitoring applications, achieving
accurate pod-counting with an adjusted R-squared of 0.8987 for images with 10
to 120 pods under challenging field conditions.

Conclusion: Logo-VGR通过领域特定多模态推理解决了传统方法的过拟合问题，显著提升了开放世界标志识别的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been
primarily evaluated on general-purpose benchmarks, while their applications in
domain-specific scenarios, such as intelligent product moderation, remain
underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce an open-world logo recognition
benchmark, a core challenge in product moderation. Unlike traditional logo
recognition methods that rely on memorizing representations of tens of
thousands of brands-an impractical approach in real-world settings-our proposed
method, Logo-VGR, enables generalization to large-scale brand recognition with
supervision from only a small subset of brands. Specifically, we reformulate
logo recognition as a comparison-based task, requiring the model to match
product images with candidate logos rather than directly generating brand
labels. We further observe that existing models tend to overfit by memorizing
brand distributions instead of learning robust multimodal reasoning, which
results in poor performance on unseen brands. To overcome this limitation,
Logo-VGR introduces a new paradigm of domain-specific multimodal reasoning:
Logo Perception Grounding injects domain knowledge, and Logo-Guided Visual
Grounded Reasoning enhances the model's reasoning capability. Experimental
results show that Logo-VGR outperforms strong baselines by nearly 10 points in
OOD settings, demonstrating superior generalization.

Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal distribution of species is a cornerstone of
ecology and conservation. By pairing species observations with geographic and
environmental predictors, researchers can model the relationship between an
environment and the species which may be found there. To advance the state-
of-the-art in this area with deep learning models and remote sensing data, we
organized an open machine learning challenge called GeoLifeCLEF 2023. The
training dataset comprised 5 million plant species observations (single
positive label per sample) distributed across Europe and covering most of its
flora, high-resolution rasters: remote sensing imagery, land cover, elevation,
in addition to coarse-resolution data: climate, soil and human footprint
variables. In this multi-label classification task, we evaluated models ability
to predict the species composition in 22 thousand small plots based on
standardized surveys. This paper presents an overview of the competition,
synthesizes the approaches used by the participating teams, and analyzes the
main results. In particular, we highlight the biases faced by the methods
fitted to single positive labels when it comes to the multi-label evaluation,
and the new and effective learning strategy combining single and multi-label
data in training.

Conclusion: VELA解决了长描述评估的局限性，为未来研究提供了新基准。

Abstract: In this study, we focus on the automatic evaluation of long and detailed
image captions generated by multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Most
existing automatic evaluation metrics for image captioning are primarily
designed for short captions and are not suitable for evaluating long captions.
Moreover, recent LLM-as-a-Judge approaches suffer from slow inference due to
their reliance on autoregressive inference and early fusion of visual
information. To address these limitations, we propose VELA, an automatic
evaluation metric for long captions developed within a novel
LLM-Hybrid-as-a-Judge framework. Furthermore, we propose LongCap-Arena, a
benchmark specifically designed for evaluating metrics for long captions. This
benchmark comprises 7,805 images, the corresponding human-provided long
reference captions and long candidate captions, and 32,246 human judgments from
three distinct perspectives: Descriptiveness, Relevance, and Fluency. We
demonstrated that VELA outperformed existing metrics and achieved superhuman
performance on LongCap-Arena.

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励引导图像编辑提供了高效且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion and flow-matching models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in high-fidelity image synthesis. A prominent line of
research involves reward-guided guidance, which steers the generation process
during inference to align with specific objectives. However, leveraging this
reward-guided approach to the task of image editing, which requires preserving
the semantic content of the source image while enhancing a target reward, is
largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for
training-free, reward-guided image editing. We formulate the editing process as
a trajectory optimal control problem where the reverse process of a diffusion
model is treated as a controllable trajectory originating from the source
image, and the adjoint states are iteratively updated to steer the editing
process. Through extensive experiments across distinct editing tasks, we
demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing
inversion-based training-free guidance baselines, achieving a superior balance
between reward maximization and fidelity to the source image without reward
hacking.

Result: VAPO-Thinker-7B模型显著提升视觉信息依赖，并在多个基准测试中达到新最优。

Conclusion: VAPO方法有效解决视觉遗忘问题，为多模态推理提供新方向。

Abstract: Reasoning has emerged as a pivotal capability in Large Language Models
(LLMs). Through Reinforcement Learning (RL), typically Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), these models are able to solve complex tasks such as
mathematics and code generation. Building on these advances, recent research
has sought to extend reasoning to Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yielding
promising results across diverse visual tasks. Despite this progress, our study
uncovers the dual nature of multimodal reasoning: while it substantially
enhances logical inference and facilitates performance on challenging problems,
it may gradually impair perceptual grounding, leading to recognition failures
on otherwise basic visual questions. Through further analysis, we attribute
this phenomenon to visual forgetting, wherein prolonged reasoning causes the
model to increasingly disregard visual input. To address this, we propose
Vision-Anchored Policy Optimization (VAPO), a simple yet effective method that
explicitly steers the reasoning process toward visually grounded trajectories.
Our result model, VAPO-Thinker-7B, significantly strengthens the model's
reliance on visual information and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a
wide range of established benchmarks. Project page:

Conclusion: 新数据集和基准测试有助于深入分析和评估SLAM方法，支持不同难度级别的测试。

Abstract: Precise 6-DoF simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) from onboard
sensors is critical for wearable devices capturing egocentric data, which
exhibits specific challenges, such as a wider diversity of motions and
viewpoints, prevalent dynamic visual content, or long sessions affected by
time-varying sensor calibration. While recent progress on SLAM has been swift,
academic research is still driven by benchmarks that do not reflect these
challenges or do not offer sufficiently accurate ground truth poses. In this
paper, we introduce a new dataset and benchmark for visual-inertial SLAM with
egocentric, multi-modal data. We record hours and kilometers of trajectories
through a city center with glasses-like devices equipped with various sensors.
We leverage surveying tools to obtain control points as indirect pose
annotations that are metric, centimeter-accurate, and available at city scale.
This makes it possible to evaluate extreme trajectories that involve walking at
night or traveling in a vehicle. We show that state-of-the-art systems
developed by academia are not robust to these challenges and we identify
components that are responsible for this. In addition, we design tracks with
different levels of difficulty to ease in-depth analysis and evaluation of less
mature approaches. The dataset and benchmark are available at

Abstract: Multimodal symbolic logical reasoning, which aims to deduce new facts from
multimodal input via formal logic, is critical in high-stakes applications such
as autonomous driving and medical diagnosis, as its rigorous, deterministic
reasoning helps prevent serious consequences. To evaluate such capabilities of
current state-of-the-art vision language models (VLMs), we introduce the first
benchmark MuSLR for multimodal symbolic logical reasoning grounded in formal
logical rules. MuSLR comprises 1,093 instances across 7 domains, including 35
atomic symbolic logic and 976 logical combinations, with reasoning depths
ranging from 2 to 9. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art VLMs on MuSLR and find that
they all struggle with multimodal symbolic reasoning, with the best model,
GPT-4.1, achieving only 46.8%. Thus, we propose LogiCAM, a modular framework
that applies formal logical rules to multimodal inputs, boosting GPT-4.1's
Chain-of-Thought performance by 14.13%, and delivering even larger gains on
complex logics such as first-order logic. We also conduct a comprehensive error
analysis, showing that around 70% of failures stem from logical misalignment
between modalities, offering key insights to guide future improvements. All

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is increasingly relying on foundation models,
aiming for strong out-of-distribution generalization and rapid adaptation in
real-world deployments. Notably, past studies have primarily focused on textual
prompt tuning, leaving the intrinsic visual counterpart fragmented into
processing steps specific to each foundation model. We aim to address this
limitation by proposing a unified patch-focused framework, Patch-Exclusive
Anomaly Detection (PatchEAD), enabling training-free anomaly detection that is
compatible with diverse foundation models. The framework constructs visual
prompting techniques, including an alignment module and foreground masking. Our
experiments show superior few-shot and batch zero-shot performance compared to
prior work, despite the absence of textual features. Our study further examines
how backbone structure and pretrained characteristics affect patch-similarity
robustness, providing actionable guidance for selecting and configuring
foundation models for real-world visual inspection. These results confirm that
a well-unified patch-only framework can enable quick, calibration-light
deployment without the need for carefully engineered textual prompts.

Abstract: In recent years, the fusion of camera data with LiDAR measurements has
emerged as a powerful approach to enhance spatial understanding. This study
introduces a novel, hardware-agnostic methodology that generates colourised
point clouds from mechanical LiDAR using multiple camera inputs, providing
complete 360-degree coverage. The primary innovation lies in its robustness
under low-light conditions, achieved through the integration of a low-light
image enhancement module within the fusion pipeline. The system requires
initial calibration to determine intrinsic camera parameters, followed by
automatic computation of the geometric transformation between the LiDAR and
cameras, removing the need for specialised calibration targets and streamlining
the setup. The data processing framework uses colour correction to ensure
uniformity across camera feeds before fusion. The algorithm was tested using a
Velodyne Puck Hi-Res LiDAR and a four-camera configuration. The optimised
software achieved real-time performance and reliable colourisation even under
very low illumination, successfully recovering scene details that would
otherwise remain undetectable.

Result: 在三个癌症队列上的实验证实了MAPLE在少样本病理诊断任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: MAPLE通过整合多尺度视觉语义和实体级预测，显著提升了少样本WSI分类的性能。

Abstract: Prompt learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for adapting pre-trained
vision-language models (VLMs) to few-shot whole slide image (WSI)
classification by aligning visual features with textual representations,
thereby reducing annotation cost and enhancing model generalization.
Nevertheless, existing methods typically rely on slide-level prompts and fail
to capture the subtype-specific phenotypic variations of histological entities
(\emph{e.g.,} nuclei, glands) that are critical for cancer diagnosis. To
address this gap, we propose Multi-scale Attribute-enhanced Prompt Learning
(\textbf{MAPLE}), a hierarchical framework for few-shot WSI classification that
jointly integrates multi-scale visual semantics and performs prediction at both
the entity and slide levels. Specifically, we first leverage large language
models (LLMs) to generate entity-level prompts that can help identify
multi-scale histological entities and their phenotypic attributes, as well as
slide-level prompts to capture global visual descriptions. Then, an
entity-guided cross-attention module is proposed to generate entity-level
features, followed by aligning with their corresponding subtype-specific
attributes for fine-grained entity-level prediction. To enrich entity
representations, we further develop a cross-scale entity graph learning module
that can update these representations by capturing their semantic correlations
within and across scales. The refined representations are then aggregated into
a slide-level representation and aligned with the corresponding prompts for
slide-level prediction. Finally, we combine both entity-level and slide-level
outputs to produce the final prediction results. Results on three cancer
cohorts confirm the effectiveness of our approach in addressing few-shot
pathology diagnosis tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的视觉语言模型（VLMs）主要依赖文本推理，而“用图像思考”范式通过图像交互推理提供了更深入的理解和更忠实的结果。

Method: 提出DeepSketcher，包含31k条链式推理轨迹的数据集和直接在视觉嵌入空间生成“视觉思维”的模型。

Result: 在多模态推理基准测试中表现优异，验证了数据集和模型设计的有效性。

Conclusion: DeepSketcher为多模态推理提供了工具无关且更灵活的“用图像思考”方法，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The "thinking with images" paradigm represents a pivotal shift in the
reasoning of Vision Language Models (VLMs), moving from text-dominant
chain-of-thought to image-interactive reasoning. By invoking visual tools or
generating intermediate visual representations, VLMs can iteratively attend to
fine-grained regions, enabling deeper image understanding and more faithful
multimodal reasoning. As an emerging paradigm, however, it still leaves
substantial room for exploration in data construction accuracy, structural
design, and broader application scenarios, which offer rich opportunities for
advancing multimodal reasoning. To further advance this line of work, we
present DeepSketcher, a comprehensive suite comprising both an image-text
interleaved dataset and a self-contained model. The dataset contains 31k
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning trajectories with diverse tool calls and
resulting edited images, covering a wide range of data types and manipulation
instructions with high annotation accuracy. Building on this resource, we
design a model that performs interleaved image-text reasoning and natively
generates "visual thoughts" by operating directly in the visual embedding
space, rather than invoking external tools and repeatedly re-encoding generated
images. This design enables tool-free and more flexible "thinking with images".
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate strong
performance, validating both the utility of the dataset and the effectiveness
of the model design.

Abstract: We introduce mpLLM, a prompt-conditioned hierarchical mixture-of-experts
(MoE) architecture for visual question answering over multi-parametric 3D brain
MRI (mpMRI). mpLLM routes across modality-level and token-level projection
experts to fuse multiple interrelated 3D modalities, enabling efficient
training without image--report pretraining. To address limited image-text
paired supervision, mpLLM integrates a synthetic visual question answering
(VQA) protocol that generates medically relevant VQA from segmentation
annotations, and we collaborate with medical experts for clinical validation.
mpLLM outperforms strong medical VLM baselines by 5.3% on average across
multiple mpMRI datasets. Our study features three main contributions: (1) the
first clinically validated VQA dataset for 3D brain mpMRI, (2) a novel
multimodal LLM that handles multiple interrelated 3D modalities, and (3) strong
empirical results that demonstrate the medical utility of our methodology.
Ablations highlight the importance of modality-level and token-level experts

Result: LLaVAShield在多轮内容审核任务中表现优异，建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 论文为多模态多轮对话安全提供了系统定义和解决方案，支持未来研究。

Abstract: As Vision-Language Models (VLMs) move into interactive, multi-turn use, new
safety risks arise that single-turn or single-modality moderation misses. In
Multimodal Multi-Turn (MMT) dialogues, malicious intent can be spread across
turns and images, while context-sensitive replies may still advance harmful
content. To address this challenge, we present the first systematic definition
and study of MMT dialogue safety. Building on this formulation, we introduce
the Multimodal Multi-turn Dialogue Safety (MMDS) dataset. We further develop an
automated multimodal multi-turn red-teaming framework based on Monte Carlo Tree
Search (MCTS) to generate unsafe multimodal multi-turn dialogues for MMDS. MMDS
contains 4,484 annotated multimodal dialogue samples with fine-grained safety
ratings, policy dimension labels, and evidence-based rationales for both users
and assistants. Leveraging MMDS, we present LLaVAShield, a powerful tool that
jointly detects and assesses risk in user inputs and assistant responses.
Across comprehensive experiments, LLaVAShield consistently outperforms strong
baselines on MMT content moderation tasks and under dynamic policy
configurations, establishing new state-of-the-art results. We will publicly
release the dataset and model to support future research.

Motivation: 视觉语言模型在高层次场景理解上表现优异，但在需要精确定位的细粒度感知任务上表现不佳。

Method: 提出VLM-FO1框架，结合混合细粒度区域编码器（HFRE）和基于令牌的引用系统，将任务转化为特征检索。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，提升了对象定位和视觉区域推理能力。

Conclusion: VLM-FO1为构建感知感知的视觉语言模型提供了有效范式，弥合了高层次推理与细粒度视觉定位之间的差距。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at high-level scene understanding but
falter on fine-grained perception tasks requiring precise localization. This
failure stems from a fundamental mismatch, as generating exact numerical
coordinates is a challenging task for language-centric architectures. In this
paper, we introduce VLM-FO1, a novel framework that overcomes this limitation
by reframing object-centric perception from a brittle coordinate generation
problem into a robust feature retrieval task. Our method operates as a
plug-and-play module that integrates with any pre-trained VLM. It leverages a
Hybrid Fine-grained Region Encoder (HFRE), featuring a dual vision encoder, to
generate powerful region tokens rich in both semantic and spatial detail. A
token-based referencing system then enables the LLM to seamlessly reason about
and ground language in these specific visual regions. Experiments show that
VLM-FO1 achieves state-of-the-art performance across a diverse suite of
benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional capabilities in object grounding, region
generational understanding, and visual region reasoning. Crucially, our
two-stage training strategy ensures that these perception gains are achieved
without compromising the base model's general visual understanding
capabilities. VLM-FO1 establishes an effective and flexible paradigm for
building perception-aware VLMs, bridging the gap between high-level reasoning
and fine-grained visual grounding.

Motivation: 探究训练数据特性如何影响深度神经网络的对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 评估36种视觉模型在六种黑盒攻击下的表现，分析数据量和模型规模的影响。

Result: 数据量增加10倍，攻击成功率降低3.2%；模型规模增加10倍，攻击成功率降低13.4%。自监督模型在精选数据上表现更优。

Conclusion: 对抗鲁棒性不仅依赖规模，数据质量、架构和训练目标更为关键。

Abstract: Deep neural networks remain vulnerable to adversarial examples despite
advances in architectures and training paradigms. We investigate how training
data characteristics affect adversarial robustness across 36 state-of-the-art
vision models spanning supervised, self-supervised, and contrastive learning
approaches, trained on datasets from 1.2M to 22B images. Models were evaluated
under six black-box attack categories: random perturbations, two types of
geometric masks, COCO object manipulations, ImageNet-C corruptions, and
ImageNet-R style shifts. Robustness follows a logarithmic scaling law with both
data volume and model size: a tenfold increase in data reduces attack success
rate (ASR) on average by ~3.2%, whereas a tenfold increase in model size
reduces ASR on average by ~13.4%. Notably, some self-supervised models trained
on curated datasets, such as DINOv2, outperform others trained on much larger
but less curated datasets, challenging the assumption that scale alone drives
robustness. Adversarial fine-tuning of ResNet50s improves generalization across
structural variations but not across color distributions. Human evaluation
reveals persistent gaps between human and machine vision. These results show
that while scaling improves robustness, data quality, architecture, and
training objectives play a more decisive role than raw scale in achieving
broad-spectrum adversarial resilience.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法将模态和类别视为独立因素，导致解决方案碎片化和内存开销过大，且多类重建方法难以处理跨域大变化。

Method: 采用Mixture-of-Experts驱动的特征解压缩机制，结合“从通用到特定”范式，通过稀疏门控跨MoE动态选择专家路径。

Conclusion: UniMMAD通过统一框架解决了多模态和多类异常检测的挑战，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Existing anomaly detection (AD) methods often treat the modality and class as
independent factors. Although this paradigm has enriched the development of AD
research branches and produced many specialized models, it has also led to
fragmented solutions and excessive memory overhead. Moreover,
reconstruction-based multi-class approaches typically rely on shared decoding
paths, which struggle to handle large variations across domains, resulting in
distorted normality boundaries, domain interference, and high false alarm
rates. To address these limitations, we propose UniMMAD, a unified framework
for multi-modal and multi-class anomaly detection. At the core of UniMMAD is a
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven feature decompression mechanism, which enables
adaptive and disentangled reconstruction tailored to specific domains. This
process is guided by a ``general to specific'' paradigm. In the encoding stage,
multi-modal inputs of varying combinations are compressed into compact,
general-purpose features. The encoder incorporates a feature compression module
to suppress latent anomalies, encourage cross-modal interaction, and avoid
shortcut learning. In the decoding stage, the general features are decompressed
into modality-specific and class-specific forms via a sparsely-gated cross MoE,
which dynamically selects expert pathways based on input modality and class. To
further improve efficiency, we design a grouped dynamic filtering mechanism and
a MoE-in-MoE structure, reducing parameter usage by 75\% while maintaining
sparse activation and fast inference. UniMMAD achieves state-of-the-art
performance on 9 anomaly detection datasets, spanning 3 fields, 12 modalities,
and 66 classes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CO3方法，通过纠正采样策略改善多概念提示在文本到图像扩散模型中的保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多概念提示（如“猫和狗”）常导致图像中概念缺失或冲突，扩散模型可能过度强调训练中学习较强的单一概念。

Method: 引入纠正采样策略，避免联合提示行为与单一概念重叠过强的区域，引导模型朝向所有概念平衡共存的“纯”联合模式。

Result: 实验表明CO3在多概念提示中提高了概念覆盖、平衡和鲁棒性，减少了概念丢失或扭曲。

Conclusion: 轻量级纠正指导可显著缓解现代扩散系统中的语义对齐脆弱性。

Abstract: We propose to improve multi-concept prompt fidelity in text-to-image
diffusion models. We begin with common failure cases-prompts like "a cat and a
dog" that sometimes yields images where one concept is missing, faint, or
colliding awkwardly with another. We hypothesize that this happens when the
diffusion model drifts into mixed modes that over-emphasize a single concept it
learned strongly during training. Instead of re-training, we introduce a
corrective sampling strategy that steers away from regions where the joint
prompt behavior overlaps too strongly with any single concept in the prompt.
The goal is to steer towards "pure" joint modes where all concepts can coexist
with balanced visual presence. We further show that existing multi-concept
guidance schemes can operate in unstable weight regimes that amplify imbalance;
we characterize favorable regions and adapt sampling to remain within them. Our
approach, CO3, is plug-and-play, requires no model tuning, and complements
standard classifier-free guidance. Experiments on diverse multi-concept prompts
indicate improvements in concept coverage, balance and robustness, with fewer
dropped or distorted concepts compared to standard baselines and prior
compositional methods. Results suggest that lightweight corrective guidance can
substantially mitigate brittle semantic alignment behavior in modern diffusion
systems.

Method: 构建分层解剖图，通过文本提示递归重建解剖区域，结合区域级对比学习增强语义对齐。

Result: 在无需专家标注的情况下，SS-ACL在词汇准确性和临床效果上分别提升10%和25%，并在下游视觉任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SS-ACL为医学报告生成提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-grounded medical report generation aims to produce clinically accurate
descriptions of medical images, anchored in explicit visual evidence to improve
interpretability and facilitate integration into clinical workflows. However,
existing methods often rely on separately trained detection modules that
require extensive expert annotations, introducing high labeling costs and
limiting generalizability due to pathology distribution bias across datasets.
To address these challenges, we propose Self-Supervised Anatomical Consistency
Learning (SS-ACL) -- a novel and annotation-free framework that aligns
generated reports with corresponding anatomical regions using simple textual
prompts. SS-ACL constructs a hierarchical anatomical graph inspired by the
invariant top-down inclusion structure of human anatomy, organizing entities by
spatial location. It recursively reconstructs fine-grained anatomical regions
to enforce intra-sample spatial alignment, inherently guiding attention maps
toward visually relevant areas prompted by text. To further enhance
inter-sample semantic alignment for abnormality recognition, SS-ACL introduces
a region-level contrastive learning based on anatomical consistency. These
aligned embeddings serve as priors for report generation, enabling attention
maps to provide interpretable visual evidence. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SS-ACL, without relying on expert annotations, (i) generates
accurate and visually grounded reports -- outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by 10\% in lexical accuracy and 25\% in clinical efficacy, and (ii)
achieves competitive performance on various downstream visual tasks, surpassing
current leading visual foundation models by 8\% in zero-shot visual grounding.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化鲑鱼福利监测提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Computer Vision (CV)-based continuous, automated and precise salmon welfare
monitoring is a key step toward reduced salmon mortality and improved salmon
welfare in industrial aquaculture net pens. Available CV methods for
determining welfare indicators focus on single indicators and rely on object
detectors and trackers from other application areas to aid their welfare
indicator calculation algorithm. This comes with a high resource demand for
real-world applications, since each indicator must be calculated separately. In
addition, the methods are vulnerable to difficulties in underwater salmon
scenes, such as object occlusion, similar object appearance, and similar object
motion. To address these challenges, we propose a flexible tracking framework
that uses a pose estimation network to extract bounding boxes around salmon and
their corresponding body parts, and exploits information about the body parts,
through specialized modules, to tackle challenges specific to underwater salmon
scenes. Subsequently, the high-detail body part tracks are employed to
calculate welfare indicators. We construct two novel datasets assessing two
salmon tracking challenges: salmon ID transfers in crowded scenes and salmon ID
switches during turning. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art
pedestrian tracker, BoostTrack, for both salmon tracking challenges.
Additionally, we create a dataset for calculating salmon tail beat wavelength,
demonstrating that our body part tracking method is well-suited for automated
welfare monitoring based on tail beat analysis. Datasets and code are available

Conclusion: PinPoint3D显著提升了复杂3D环境中机器感知与交互的精确性。

Abstract: Fine-grained 3D part segmentation is crucial for enabling embodied AI systems
to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as interacting with specific
functional components of an object. However, existing interactive segmentation
methods are largely confined to coarse, instance-level targets, while
non-interactive approaches struggle with sparse, real-world scans and suffer
from a severe lack of annotated data. To address these limitations, we
introduce PinPoint3D, a novel interactive framework for fine-grained,
multi-granularity 3D segmentation, capable of generating precise part-level
masks from only a few user point clicks. A key component of our work is a new
3D data synthesis pipeline that we developed to create a large-scale,
scene-level dataset with dense part annotations, overcoming a critical
bottleneck that has hindered progress in this field. Through comprehensive
experiments and user studies, we demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average IoU of around 55.8% on
each object part under first-click settings and surpassing 71.3% IoU with only
a few additional clicks. Compared to current state-of-the-art baselines,
PinPoint3D yields up to a 16% improvement in IoU and precision, highlighting
its effectiveness on challenging, sparse point clouds with high efficiency. Our
work represents a significant step towards more nuanced and precise machine
perception and interaction in complex 3D environments.

Result: 实验表明RH-Partial2Global在多种视觉任务中优于Partial2Global。

Conclusion: RH-Partial2Global为视觉上下文学习提供了更可靠和全面的示例选择方法。

Abstract: Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a prominent approach for
adapting visual foundation models to novel tasks, by effectively exploiting
contextual information embedded in in-context examples, which can be formulated
as a global ranking problem of potential candidates. Current VICL methods, such
as Partial2Global and VPR, are grounded in the similarity-priority assumption
that images more visually similar to a query image serve as better in-context
examples. This foundational assumption, while intuitive, lacks sufficient
justification for its efficacy in selecting optimal in-context examples.
Furthermore, Partial2Global constructs its global ranking from a series of
randomly sampled pairwise preference predictions. Such a reliance on random
sampling can lead to incomplete coverage and redundant samplings of
comparisons, thus further adversely impacting the final global ranking. To
address these issues, this paper introduces an enhanced variant of
Partial2Global designed for reliable and holistic selection of in-context
examples in VICL. Our proposed method, dubbed RH-Partial2Global, leverages a
jackknife conformal prediction-guided strategy to construct reliable
alternative sets and a covering design-based sampling approach to ensure
comprehensive and uniform coverage of pairwise preferences. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RH-Partial2Global achieves excellent performance
and outperforms Partial2Global across diverse visual tasks.

Motivation: 传统注意力机制在长视频和高分辨率视频中计算复杂度高，限制了实时视频处理的应用。

Method: 提出VRWKV-Editor，结合RWKV变换器的双向加权键值递归机制，实现线性复杂度。

Result: 实验显示速度提升3.7倍，内存使用降低60%，且保持帧一致性和文本对齐性能。

Conclusion: VRWKV-Editor在长视频编辑中显著优于传统自注意力架构。

Abstract: In light of recent progress in video editing, deep learning models focusing
on both spatial and temporal dependencies have emerged as the primary method.
However, these models suffer from the quadratic computational complexity of
traditional attention mechanisms, making them difficult to adapt to
long-duration and high-resolution videos. This limitation restricts their
applicability in practical contexts such as real-time video processing. To
tackle this challenge, we introduce a method to reduce both time and space
complexity of these systems by proposing VRWKV-Editor, a novel video editing
model that integrates a linear spatio-temporal aggregation module into
video-based diffusion models. VRWKV-Editor leverages bidirectional weighted
key-value recurrence mechanism of the RWKV transformer to capture global
dependencies while preserving temporal coherence, achieving linear complexity
without sacrificing quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves up to 3.7x speedup and 60% lower memory usage compared
to state-of-the-art diffusion-based video editing methods, while maintaining
competitive performance in frame consistency and text alignment. Furthermore, a
comparative analysis we conducted on videos with different sequence lengths
confirms that the gap in editing speed between our approach and architectures
with self-attention becomes more significant with long videos.

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和Ego4D数据集上，WISH超越了所有基线方法，性能达到全监督方法的50%以上。

Conclusion: 自然语言叙述是一种有效的弱监督形式，能够显著减少对像素级标注的依赖。

Abstract: Pixel-level recognition of objects manipulated by the user from egocentric
images enables key applications spanning assistive technologies, industrial
safety, and activity monitoring. However, progress in this area is currently
hindered by the scarcity of annotated datasets, as existing approaches rely on
costly manual labels. In this paper, we propose to learn human-object
interaction detection leveraging narrations -- natural language descriptions of
the actions performed by the camera wearer which contain clues about
manipulated objects (e.g., "I am pouring vegetables from the chopping board to
the pan"). Narrations provide a form of weak supervision that is cheap to
acquire and readily available in state-of-the-art egocentric datasets. We
introduce Narration-Supervised in-Hand Object Segmentation (NS-iHOS), a novel
task where models have to learn to segment in-hand objects by learning from
natural-language narrations. Narrations are then not employed at inference
time. We showcase the potential of the task by proposing Weakly-Supervised
In-hand Object Segmentation from Human Narrations (WISH), an end-to-end model
distilling knowledge from narrations to learn plausible hand-object
associations and enable in-hand object segmentation without using narrations at
test time. We benchmark WISH against different baselines based on
open-vocabulary object detectors and vision-language models, showing the
superiority of its design. Experiments on EPIC-Kitchens and Ego4D show that
WISH surpasses all baselines, recovering more than 50% of the performance of
fully supervised methods, without employing fine-grained pixel-wise
annotations.

TL;DR: AgenticIQA是一个模块化框架，结合视觉语言模型与传统IQA工具，动态解决图像质量评估问题，显著提升评分准确性和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统IQA方法依赖固定模型，难以适应多样化失真和用户需求，且评分与解释分离。

Method: 通过分解IQA为四个子任务（失真检测、分析、工具选择和执行），由规划器、执行器和总结器协同完成。

Result: 在多个数据集上，AgenticIQA在评分准确性和解释对齐性上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: AgenticIQA通过动态规划和多任务协同，显著提升了IQA的适应性和解释能力。

Abstract: Image quality assessment (IQA) is inherently complex, as it reflects both the
quantification and interpretation of perceptual quality rooted in the human
visual system. Conventional approaches typically rely on fixed models to output
scalar scores, limiting their adaptability to diverse distortions,
user-specific queries, and interpretability needs. Furthermore, scoring and
interpretation are often treated as independent processes, despite their
interdependence: interpretation identifies perceptual degradations, while
scoring abstracts them into a compact metric. To address these limitations, we
propose AgenticIQA, a modular agentic framework that integrates vision-language
models (VLMs) with traditional IQA tools in a dynamic, query-aware manner.
AgenticIQA decomposes IQA into four subtasks -- distortion detection,
distortion analysis, tool selection, and tool execution -- coordinated by a
planner, executor, and summarizer. The planner formulates task-specific
strategies, the executor collects perceptual evidence via tool invocation, and
the summarizer integrates this evidence to produce accurate scores with
human-aligned explanations. To support training and evaluation, we introduce
AgenticIQA-200K, a large-scale instruction dataset tailored for IQA agents, and
AgenticIQA-Eval, the first benchmark for assessing the planning, execution, and
summarization capabilities of VLM-based IQA agents. Extensive experiments
across diverse IQA datasets demonstrate that AgenticIQA consistently surpasses
strong baselines in both scoring accuracy and explanatory alignment.

TL;DR: PFDepth提出了一种异构多视角深度估计的针孔-鱼眼框架，通过联合优化针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性，实现了高性能的深度估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用针孔和鱼眼图像的互补特性（如畸变、视场大小、远近场）进行联合优化，解决异构多视角深度估计问题。

Method: 采用统一架构处理异构相机组合，通过3D体积空间和异构空间融合模块处理特征，并引入3D高斯表示进行精细聚合。

Result: 在KITTI-360和RealHet数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PFDepth是首个系统性研究异构针孔-鱼眼深度估计的工作，具有技术新颖性和实用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first pinhole-fisheye framework for
heterogeneous multi-view depth estimation, PFDepth. Our key insight is to
exploit the complementary characteristics of pinhole and fisheye imagery
(undistorted vs. distorted, small vs. large FOV, far vs. near field) for joint
optimization. PFDepth employs a unified architecture capable of processing
arbitrary combinations of pinhole and fisheye cameras with varied intrinsics
and extrinsics. Within PFDepth, we first explicitly lift 2D features from each
heterogeneous view into a canonical 3D volumetric space. Then, a core module
termed Heterogeneous Spatial Fusion is designed to process and fuse
distortion-aware volumetric features across overlapping and non-overlapping
regions. Additionally, we subtly reformulate the conventional voxel fusion into
a novel 3D Gaussian representation, in which learnable latent Gaussian spheres
dynamically adapt to local image textures for finer 3D aggregation. Finally,
fused volume features are rendered into multi-view depth maps. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PFDepth sets a state-of-the-art
performance on KITTI-360 and RealHet datasets over current mainstream depth
networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of
heterogeneous pinhole-fisheye depth estimation, offering both technical novelty
and valuable empirical insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二阶PDE模型在抑制乘性噪声时容易在早期去噪阶段引入块状伪影，因此需要一种更高效的模型。

Method: 提出了一种四阶非线性PDE模型，结合了拉普拉斯和强度值引导的扩散过程（降噪）和波动部分（保留细节）。

Result: 在PSNR、MSSIM和SI指标上优于两种二阶各向异性扩散方法，且在彩色图像中保持了结构和颜色一致性。

Conclusion: 该模型在多种图像类型中均表现出优越的去噪性能，优于现有同类模型。

Abstract: Second-order PDE models have been widely used for suppressing multiplicative
noise, but they often introduce blocky artifacts in the early stages of
denoising. To resolve this, we propose a fourth-order nonlinear PDE model that
integrates diffusion and wave properties. The diffusion process, guided by both
the Laplacian and intensity values, reduces noise better than gradient-based
methods, while the wave part keeps fine details and textures. The effectiveness
of the proposed model is evaluated against two second-order anisotropic
diffusion approaches using the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Mean
Structural Similarity Index (MSSIM) for images with available ground truth. For
SAR images, where a noise-free reference is unavailable, the Speckle Index (SI)
is used to measure noise reduction. Additionally, we extend the proposed model
to study color images by applying the denoising process independently to each
channel, preserving both structure and color consistency. The same quantitative
metrics PSNR and MSSIM are used for performance evaluation, ensuring a fair
comparison across grayscale and color images. In all the cases, our computed
results produce better results compared to existing models in this genre.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SETR提出了一种两阶段检索方法，通过交集驱动策略和细粒度重排序，解决了CLIP-based方法在零样本组合图像检索中的问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP-based方法在零样本组合图像检索中存在特征融合不精确和全局相似性无法处理细粒度语义的问题。

Method: SETR采用两阶段方法：粗检索阶段通过交集驱动策略过滤无关信息；细粒度重排序阶段使用多模态LLM进行二元语义判断。

Result: 在CIRR、Fashion-IQ和CIRCO数据集上，SETR实现了新的SOTA性能，Recall@1提升高达15.15点。

Conclusion: 两阶段推理是零样本组合图像检索的通用范式，SETR展示了其鲁棒性和可移植性。

Abstract: Zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve a target image
given a reference image and a relative text, without relying on costly triplet
annotations. Existing CLIP-based methods face two core challenges: (1)
union-based feature fusion indiscriminately aggregates all visual cues,
carrying over irrelevant background details that dilute the intended
modification, and (2) global cosine similarity from CLIP embeddings lacks the
ability to resolve fine-grained semantic relations. To address these issues, we
propose SETR (Semantic-enhanced Two-Stage Retrieval). In the coarse retrieval
stage, SETR introduces an intersection-driven strategy that retains only the
overlapping semantics between the reference image and relative text, thereby
filtering out distractors inherent to union-based fusion and producing a
cleaner, high-precision candidate set. In the fine-grained re-ranking stage, we
adapt a pretrained multimodal LLM with Low-Rank Adaptation to conduct binary
semantic relevance judgments ("Yes/No"), which goes beyond CLIP's global
feature matching by explicitly verifying relational and attribute-level
consistency. Together, these two stages form a complementary pipeline: coarse
retrieval narrows the candidate pool with high recall, while re-ranking ensures
precise alignment with nuanced textual modifications. Experiments on CIRR,
Fashion-IQ, and CIRCO show that SETR achieves new state-of-the-art performance,
improving Recall@1 on CIRR by up to 15.15 points. Our results establish
two-stage reasoning as a general paradigm for robust and portable ZS-CIR.

TL;DR: GeoLink是一个多模态框架，通过整合OpenStreetMap（OSM）数据增强遥感（RS）基础模型（FMs），提升地理空间智能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感与OSM数据之间的模态差异问题，提升地理空间任务的性能。

Method: 利用OSM数据在预训练和下游任务阶段增强RS FM，包括多粒度学习信号和图像掩膜重建。

Result: 实验表明，OSM数据在预训练中提升了RS图像编码器性能，下游任务中融合RS和OSM数据增强了模型适应性。

Conclusion: 多模态协同在高级地理空间人工智能中具有潜力，空间相关性是关键因素。

Abstract: Integrating ground-level geospatial data with rich geographic context, like
OpenStreetMap (OSM), into remote sensing (RS) foundation models (FMs) is
essential for advancing geospatial intelligence and supporting a broad spectrum
of tasks. However, modality gap between RS and OSM data, including differences
in data structure, content, and spatial granularity, makes effective synergy
highly challenging, and most existing RS FMs focus on imagery alone. To this
end, this study presents GeoLink, a multimodal framework that leverages OSM
data to enhance RS FM during both the pretraining and downstream task stages.
Specifically, GeoLink enhances RS self-supervised pretraining using
multi-granularity learning signals derived from OSM data, guided by cross-modal
spatial correlations for information interaction and collaboration. It also
introduces image mask-reconstruction to enable sparse input for efficient
pretraining. For downstream tasks, GeoLink generates both unimodal and
multimodal fine-grained encodings to support a wide range of applications, from
common RS interpretation tasks like land cover classification to more
comprehensive geographic tasks like urban function zone mapping. Extensive
experiments show that incorporating OSM data during pretraining enhances the
performance of the RS image encoder, while fusing RS and OSM data in downstream
tasks improves the FM's adaptability to complex geographic scenarios. These
results underscore the potential of multimodal synergy in advancing high-level
geospatial artificial intelligence. Moreover, we find that spatial correlation
plays a crucial role in enabling effective multimodal geospatial data
integration. Code, checkpoints, and using examples are released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在全尺寸视频超分辨率中存在计算冗余和固定输出分辨率的问题，需要探索更高效的解决方案。

Method: 提出PatchVSR，结合双流适配器（局部和全局分支）和位置信息注入，实现分块级高保真细节生成。

Result: 实验证明PatchVSR能高效生成4K超分辨率视频，保持高保真和视觉一致性。

Conclusion: PatchVSR为视频超分辨率提供了灵活高效的解决方案，显著提升了生成质量和效率。

Abstract: Pre-trained video generation models hold great potential for generative video
super-resolution (VSR). However, adapting them for full-size VSR, as most
existing methods do, suffers from unnecessary intensive full-attention
computation and fixed output resolution. To overcome these limitations, we make
the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.
This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native
for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge, we propose an
innovative approach, called PatchVSR, which integrates a dual-stream adapter
for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches
to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features
from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused by incomplete
semantics of patches. Particularly, we also inject the patch's location
information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the
global video frame. Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize
high-fidelity, high-resolution details at the patch level. A tailor-made
multi-patch joint modulation is proposed to ensure visual consistency across
individually enhanced patches. Due to the flexibility of our patch-based
paradigm, we can achieve highly competitive 4K VSR based on a 512x512
resolution base model, with extremely high efficiency.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级框架CGP，通过因果引导的高斯扰动增强OOD泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习中OOD泛化问题，尤其是在生物医学图像领域，分布偏移常见且难以处理。

Method: 使用因果引导的Vision Transformer生成软因果掩码，指导输入图像的空间变化噪声注入。

Result: 在Camelyon17基准测试中表现优于现有OOD方法。

Conclusion: 因果扰动是提升模型泛化能力和可解释性的有效工具。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization remains a central challenge in
deploying deep learning models to real-world scenarios, particularly in domains
such as biomedical images, where distribution shifts are both subtle and
pervasive. While existing methods often pursue domain invariance through
complex generative models or adversarial training, these approaches may
overlook the underlying causal mechanisms of generalization.In this work, we
propose Causally-Guided Gaussian Perturbations (CGP)-a lightweight framework
that enhances OOD generalization by injecting spatially varying noise into
input images, guided by soft causal masks derived from Vision Transformers. By
applying stronger perturbations to background regions and weaker ones to
foreground areas, CGP encourages the model to rely on causally relevant
features rather than spurious correlations.Experimental results on the
challenging WILDS benchmark Camelyon17 demonstrate consistent performance gains
over state-of-the-art OOD baselines, highlighting the potential of causal
perturbation as a tool for reliable and interpretable generalization.

TL;DR: SeMoBridge通过语义模态桥直接解决CLIP在少样本分类中的模态内不对齐问题，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在少样本分类中因模态内不对齐（模态间隙和跨模态训练目标）导致性能受限。

Method: 提出SeMoBridge，将图像映射到文本模态，保持语义内容，支持多模态监督训练。

Result: SeMoBridge-T在低数据场景（1、2、4 shots）中表现优异，训练时间短。

Conclusion: SeMoBridge有效解决了CLIP的模态内不对齐问题，提升了少样本分类性能。

Abstract: While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks
by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot
classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment.
This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively
inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated,
making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt
to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive
per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge,
a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment.
Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic
content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is
closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision,
combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection.
Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a
fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods,
particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available

TL;DR: 扩展HAMMER模型以处理全局场景不一致性问题，提出轻量级分割引导评分（SGS）方法，显著提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HAMMER在多模态操纵检测中表现优异，但在全局场景不一致（如前景-背景不匹配）时表现不佳。

Method: 提出SGS方法，利用分割掩码分离前景和背景，结合视觉-语言模型提取嵌入并计算区域感知一致性分数。

Result: SGS显著提升了HAMMER在全局操纵检测中的鲁棒性，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 区域感知推理在多模态虚假信息检测中至关重要。

Abstract: We extend HAMMER, a state-of-the-art model for multimodal manipulation
detection, to handle global scene inconsistencies such as foreground-background
(FG-BG) mismatch. While HAMMER achieves strong performance on the DGM4 dataset,
it consistently fails when the main subject is contextually misplaced into an
implausible background. We diagnose this limitation as a combination of
label-space bias, local attention focus, and spurious text-foreground
alignment. To remedy this without retraining, we propose a lightweight
segmentation-guided scoring (SGS) pipeline. SGS uses person/face segmentation
masks to separate foreground and background regions, extracts embeddings with a
joint vision-language model, and computes region-aware coherence scores. These
scores are fused with HAMMER's original prediction to improve binary detection,
grounding, and token-level explanations. SGS is inference-only, incurs
negligible computational overhead, and significantly enhances robustness to
global manipulations. This work demonstrates the importance of region-aware
reasoning in multimodal disinformation detection. We release scripts for
segmentation and scoring at https://github.com/Gaganx0/HAMMER-sgs

Conclusion: DGM4+数据集填补了全局不一致性检测的空白，有助于提升多模态模型的评估能力。

Abstract: The rapid advances in generative models have significantly lowered the
barrier to producing convincing multimodal disinformation. Fabricated images
and manipulated captions increasingly co-occur to create persuasive false
narratives. While the Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation
(DGM4) dataset established a foundation for research in this area, it is
restricted to local manipulations such as face swaps, attribute edits, and
caption changes. This leaves a critical gap: global inconsistencies, such as
mismatched foregrounds and backgrounds, which are now prevalent in real-world
forgeries. To address this, we extend DGM4 with 5,000 high-quality samples that
introduce Foreground-Background (FG-BG) mismatches and their hybrids with text
manipulations. Using OpenAI's gpt-image-1 and carefully designed prompts, we
generate human-centric news-style images where authentic figures are placed
into absurd or impossible backdrops (e.g., a teacher calmly addressing students
on the surface of Mars). Captions are produced under three conditions: literal,
text attribute, and text split, yielding three new manipulation categories:
FG-BG, FG-BG+TA, and FG-BG+TS. Quality control pipelines enforce one-to-three
visible faces, perceptual hash deduplication, OCR-based text scrubbing, and
realistic headline length. By introducing global manipulations, our extension
complements existing datasets, creating a benchmark DGM4+ that tests detectors
on both local and global reasoning. This resource is intended to strengthen
evaluation of multimodal models such as HAMMER, which currently struggle with
FG-BG inconsistencies. We release our DGM4+ dataset and generation script at

Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present
symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical
example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A
common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data
augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable
algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the
notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of
simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities
between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used
can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this
methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations,
rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a
$2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the
constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is
interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve
to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide
range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link:

Conclusion: 基础模型、时序上下文和损失计算空间的选择对自监督学习的场景理解至关重要。

Abstract: Self-supervised models have recently achieved notable advancements,
particularly in the domain of semantic occupancy prediction. These models
utilize sophisticated loss computation strategies to compensate for the absence
of ground-truth labels. For instance, techniques such as novel view synthesis,
cross-view rendering, and depth estimation have been explored to address the
issue of semantic and depth ambiguity. However, such techniques typically incur
high computational costs and memory usage during the training stage, especially
in the case of novel view synthesis. To mitigate these issues, we propose 3D
pseudo-ground-truth labels generated by the foundation models Grounded-SAM and
Metric3Dv2, and harness temporal information for label densification. Our 3D
pseudo-labels can be easily integrated into existing models, which yields
substantial performance improvements, with mIoU increasing by 45\%, from 9.73
to 14.09, when implemented into the OccNeRF model. This stands in contrast to
earlier advancements in the field, which are often not readily transferable to
other architectures. Additionally, we propose a streamlined model, EasyOcc,
achieving 13.86 mIoU. This model conducts learning solely from our labels,
avoiding complex rendering strategies mentioned previously. Furthermore, our
method enables models to attain state-of-the-art performance when evaluated on
the full scene without applying the camera mask, with EasyOcc achieving 7.71
mIoU, outperforming the previous best model by 31\%. These findings highlight
the critical importance of foundation models, temporal context, and the choice
of loss computation space in self-supervised learning for comprehensive scene
understanding.

Abstract: Penalty kicks often decide championships, yet goalkeepers must anticipate the
kicker's intent from subtle biomechanical cues within a very short time window.
This study introduces a real-time, multi-modal deep learning framework to
predict the direction of a penalty kick (left, middle, or right) before ball
contact. The model uses a dual-branch architecture: a MobileNetV2-based CNN
extracts spatial features from RGB frames, while 2D keypoints are processed by
an LSTM network with attention mechanisms. Pose-derived keypoints further guide
visual focus toward task-relevant regions. A distance-based thresholding method
segments input sequences immediately before ball contact, ensuring consistent
input across diverse footage. A custom dataset of 755 penalty kick events was
created from real match videos, with frame-level annotations for object
detection, shooter keypoints, and final ball placement. The model achieved 89%
accuracy on a held-out test set, outperforming visual-only and pose-only
baselines by 14-22%. With an inference time of 22 milliseconds, the lightweight
and interpretable design makes it suitable for goalkeeper training, tactical

Conclusion: 展示了现代LRMs的高级空间推理能力，并开源代码以推动相关研究。

Abstract: Prompt-driven scene synthesis allows users to generate complete 3D
environments from textual descriptions. Current text-to-scene methods often
struggle with complex geometries and object transformations, and tend to show
weak adherence to complex instructions. We address these limitations by
introducing Reason-3D, a text-to-scene model powered by large reasoning models
(LRMs). Reason-3D integrates object retrieval using captions covering physical,
functional, and contextual attributes. Reason-3D then places the selected
objects based on implicit and explicit layout constraints, and refines their
positions with collision-aware spatial reasoning. Evaluated on instructions
ranging from simple to complex indoor configurations, Reason-3D significantly
outperforms previous methods in human-rated visual fidelity, adherence to
constraints, and asset retrieval quality. Beyond its contribution to the field
of text-to-scene generation, our work showcases the advanced spatial reasoning
abilities of modern LRMs. Additionally, we release the codebase to further the
research in object retrieval and placement with LRMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EVODiff通过信息论视角优化扩散模型的推理过程，显著提升生成质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现优异，但推理速度慢且存在训练与推理差异。现有梯度求解器缺乏信息传输效率的理论基础。

Method: 提出信息论视角，揭示去噪过程本质是降低条件熵，进而提出熵感知的方差优化方法EVODiff。

Result: EVODiff在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，如CIFAR-10上重建误差降低45.5%，ImageNet-256上减少25%计算成本。

Conclusion: EVODiff通过优化条件熵，系统性减少不确定性，为扩散模型推理提供了高效且理论支持的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) excel in image generation, but suffer from slow
inference and the training-inference discrepancies. Although gradient-based
solvers like DPM-Solver accelerate the denoising inference, they lack
theoretical foundations in information transmission efficiency. In this work,
we introduce an information-theoretic perspective on the inference processes of
DMs, revealing that successful denoising fundamentally reduces conditional
entropy in reverse transitions. This principle leads to our key insights into
the inference processes: (1) data prediction parameterization outperforms its
noise counterpart, and (2) optimizing conditional variance offers a
reference-free way to minimize both transition and reconstruction errors. Based
on these insights, we propose an entropy-aware variance optimized method for
the generative process of DMs, called EVODiff, which systematically reduces
uncertainty by optimizing conditional entropy during denoising. Extensive
experiments on DMs validate our insights and demonstrate that our method
significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA)
gradient-based solvers. For example, compared to the DPM-Solver++, EVODiff
reduces the reconstruction error by up to 45.5\% (FID improves from 5.10 to
2.78) at 10 function evaluations (NFE) on CIFAR-10, cuts the NFE cost by 25\%
(from 20 to 15 NFE) for high-quality samples on ImageNet-256, and improves
text-to-image generation while reducing artifacts. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EchoGen是一个基于VAR模型的前馈主题驱动生成框架，通过双路径注入策略实现高效、高质量的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在主题驱动生成中效率与零样本能力之间的权衡问题。

Method: 采用双路径注入策略，分离主题的高层语义和低层细节，通过语义编码器和内容编码器分别注入。

Result: 在保持高质量的同时显著降低采样延迟，性能与基于扩散的方法相当。

Conclusion: EchoGen为VAR模型在主题驱动生成中的应用提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Subject-driven generation is a critical task in creative AI; yet current
state-of-the-art methods present a stark trade-off. They either rely on
computationally expensive, per-subject fine-tuning, sacrificing efficiency and
zero-shot capability, or employ feed-forward architectures built on diffusion
models, which are inherently plagued by slow inference speeds. Visual
Auto-Regressive (VAR) models are renowned for their rapid sampling speeds and
strong generative quality, making them an ideal yet underexplored foundation
for resolving this tension. To bridge this gap, we introduce EchoGen, a
pioneering framework that empowers VAR models with subject-driven generation
capabilities. The core design of EchoGen is an effective dual-path injection
strategy that disentangles a subject's high-level semantic identity from its
low-level fine-grained details, enabling enhanced controllability and fidelity.
We employ a semantic encoder to extract the subject's abstract identity, which
is injected through decoupled cross-attention to guide the overall composition.
Concurrently, a content encoder captures intricate visual details, which are
integrated via a multi-modal attention mechanism to ensure high-fidelity
texture and structural preservation. To the best of our knowledge, EchoGen is
the first feed-forward subject-driven framework built upon VAR models. Both
quantitative and qualitative results substantiate our design, demonstrating
that EchoGen achieves subject fidelity and image quality comparable to
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods with significantly lower sampling
latency. Code and models will be released soon.

TL;DR: EntroPE是一种基于熵的动态分块编码框架，通过动态检测时间序列中的自然过渡点来优化分块策略，提升预测精度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分块的时间序列预测方法忽视了时间连贯性，导致依赖关系断裂和表示学习效果下降。

Method: 提出EntroPE框架，包含熵基动态分块器（EDP）和自适应分块编码器（APE），通过信息熵动态确定分块边界并捕获依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明EntroPE在长期预测任务中显著提升了准确性和效率。

Conclusion: 熵引导的动态分块为时间序列建模提供了新范式，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting,
with patch-based input strategies offering efficiency and improved long-horizon
modeling. Yet, existing approaches rely on temporally-agnostic patch
construction, where arbitrary starting positions and fixed lengths fracture
temporal coherence by splitting natural transitions across boundaries. This
naive segmentation often disrupts short-term dependencies and weakens
representation learning. In response, we propose EntroPE (Entropy-Guided
Dynamic Patch Encoder), a novel, temporally informed framework that dynamically
detects transition points via conditional entropy and dynamically places patch
boundaries. This preserves temporal structure while retaining the computational
benefits of patching. EntroPE consists of two key modules, namely an
Entropy-based Dynamic Patcher (EDP) that applies information-theoretic criteria
to locate natural temporal shifts and determine patch boundaries, and an
Adaptive Patch Encoder (APE) that employs pooling and cross-attention to
capture intra-patch dependencies and produce fixed-size latent representations.
These embeddings are then processed by a global transformer to model
inter-patch dynamics. Experiments across long-term forecasting benchmarks
demonstrate that EntroPE improves both accuracy and efficiency, establishing
entropy-guided dynamic patching as a promising new paradigm for time series
modeling. Code is available at: https://github.com/Sachithx/EntroPE.

Abstract: The performance of deep neural networks is strongly influenced by the quality
of their training data. However, mitigating dataset bias by manually curating
challenging edge cases remains a major bottleneck. To address this, we propose
an automated pipeline for text-guided edge-case synthesis. Our approach employs
a Large Language Model, fine-tuned via preference learning, to rephrase image
captions into diverse textual prompts that steer a Text-to-Image model toward
generating difficult visual scenarios. Evaluated on the FishEye8K object
detection benchmark, our method achieves superior robustness, surpassing both
naive augmentation and manually engineered prompts. This work establishes a
scalable framework that shifts data curation from manual effort to automated,
targeted synthesis, offering a promising direction for developing more reliable
and continuously improving AI systems. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在人类中心场景理解方面缺乏全面评估基准，尤其是缺乏对细粒度感知和高维因果推理能力的评估。

Method: 提出Human-MME基准，包含多样化的场景、渐进式评估维度和高质量标注，支持多人和多图像的相互理解。

Result: 在17个先进MLLMs上的实验揭示了其局限性，并指导未来研究。

Conclusion: Human-MME为MLLMs在人类中心场景理解中的评估提供了全面工具，推动了相关研究的进步。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
advances in visual understanding tasks. However, their capacity to comprehend
human-centric scenes has rarely been explored, primarily due to the absence of
comprehensive evaluation benchmarks that take into account both the
human-oriented granular level and higher-dimensional causal reasoning ability.
Such high-quality evaluation benchmarks face tough obstacles, given the
physical complexity of the human body and the difficulty of annotating granular
structures. In this paper, we propose Human-MME, a curated benchmark designed
to provide a more holistic evaluation of MLLMs in human-centric scene
understanding. Compared with other existing benchmarks, our work provides three
key features: 1. Diversity in human scene, spanning 4 primary visual domains
with 15 secondary domains and 43 sub-fields to ensure broad scenario coverage.
2. Progressive and diverse evaluation dimensions, evaluating the human-based
activities progressively from the human-oriented granular perception to the
higher-dimensional reasoning, consisting of eight dimensions with 19,945
real-world image question pairs and an evaluation suite. 3. High-quality
annotations with rich data paradigms, constructing the automated annotation
pipeline and human-annotation platform, supporting rigorous manual labeling to
facilitate precise and reliable model assessment. Our benchmark extends the
single-target understanding to the multi-person and multi-image mutual
understanding by constructing the choice, short-answer, grounding, ranking and
judgment question components, and complex questions of their combination. The
extensive experiments on 17 state-of-the-art MLLMs effectively expose the
limitations and guide future MLLMs research toward better human-centric image
understanding. All data and code are available at

Motivation: 自动驾驶中行人检测的安全性和可靠性至关重要，但公平性研究较少，本文填补了这一空白。

Method: 系统评估了五种行人检测模型和三种通用模型在ECP-DP数据集上的表现，使用EOD指标量化公平性，并通过Z-test验证统计显著性。

Result: 发现检测模型对平行腿、直肘和侧身姿态的行人存在偏见，下半身遮挡对检测率影响更大，Cascade R-CNN表现最优。

Conclusion: 这是首次在自动驾驶行人检测中全面评估姿态和遮挡对公平性的影响，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Pedestrian detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving (AD), where
ensuring safety and reliability is important. While many detection models aim
to reduce miss-rates and handle challenges such as occlusion and long-range
recognition, fairness remains an underexplored yet equally important concern.
In this work, we systematically investigate how variations in the pedestrian
pose--including leg status, elbow status, and body orientation--as well as
individual joint occlusions, affect detection performance. We evaluate five
pedestrian-specific detectors (F2DNet, MGAN, ALFNet, CSP, and Cascade R-CNN)
alongside three general-purpose models (YOLOv12 variants) on the EuroCity
Persons Dense Pose (ECP-DP) dataset. Fairness is quantified using the Equal
Opportunity Difference (EOD) metric across various confidence thresholds. To
assess statistical significance and robustness, we apply the Z-test. Our
findings highlight biases against pedestrians with parallel legs, straight
elbows, and lateral views. Occlusion of lower body joints has a more negative
impact on the detection rate compared to the upper body and head. Cascade R-CNN
achieves the lowest overall miss-rate and exhibits the smallest bias across all
attributes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive pose-
and occlusion-aware fairness evaluation in pedestrian detection for AD.

Conclusion: AttriGen为多属性标注提供了高效自动化解决方案，可推广至其他计算机视觉任务。

Abstract: We introduce AttriGen, a novel framework for automated, fine-grained
multi-attribute annotation in computer vision, with a particular focus on cell
microscopy where multi-attribute classification remains underrepresented
compared to traditional cell type categorization. Using two complementary
datasets: the Peripheral Blood Cell (PBC) dataset containing eight distinct
cell types and the WBC Attribute Dataset (WBCAtt) that contains their
corresponding 11 morphological attributes, we propose a dual-model architecture
that combines a CNN for cell type classification, as well as a Vision
Transformer (ViT) for multi-attribute classification achieving a new benchmark
of 94.62\% accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that AttriGen significantly
enhances model interpretability and offers substantial time and cost efficiency
relative to conventional full-scale human annotation. Thus, our framework
establishes a new paradigm that can be extended to other computer vision
classification tasks by effectively automating the expansion of multi-attribute
labels.

extend and adapt a SOTA visual-based approach for 360-degrees video saliency
detection, and develop the TSalV360 method that takes into account a
user-provided text description of the desired objects and/or events. This
method leverages a SOTA vision-language model for data representation and
integrates a similarity estimation module and a viewport spatio-temporal

showed the competitiveness of TSalV360 compared to a SOTA visual-based approach
and documented its competency to perform customized text-driven saliency
detection in 360-degrees videos.

Abstract: Dataset distillation has emerged as a promising paradigm that synthesizes
compact, informative datasets capable of retaining the knowledge of large-scale
counterparts, thereby addressing the substantial computational and storage
burdens of modern model training. Conventional approaches typically rely on
dense pixel-level representations, which introduce redundancy and are difficult
to scale up. In this work, we propose GSDD, a novel and efficient sparse
representation for dataset distillation based on 2D Gaussians. Instead of
representing all pixels equally, GSDD encodes critical discriminative
information in a distilled image using only a small number of Gaussian
primitives. This sparse representation could improve dataset diversity under
the same storage budget, enhancing coverage of difficult samples and boosting
distillation performance. To ensure both efficiency and scalability, we adapt
CUDA-based splatting operators for parallel inference and training, enabling
high-quality rendering with minimal computational and memory overhead. Our
method is simple yet effective, broadly applicable to different distillation
pipelines, and highly scalable. Experiments show that GSDD achieves
state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet subsets,
while remaining highly efficient encoding and decoding cost. Our code is

Abstract: In this paper, we present our experimental study on generating plausible

this study, we extend an existing framework for multigranular explanation of
video summarization by integrating a SOTA Large Multimodal Model
(LLaVA-OneVision) and prompting it to produce natural language descriptions of
the obtained visual explanations. Following, we focus on one of the most
desired characteristics for explainable AI, the plausibility of the obtained
explanations that relates with their alignment with the humans' reasoning and
expectations. Using the extended framework, we propose an approach for
evaluating the plausibility of visual explanations by quantifying the semantic
overlap between their textual descriptions and the textual descriptions of the
corresponding video summaries, with the help of two methods for creating
sentence embeddings (SBERT, SimCSE). Based on the extended framework and the
proposed plausibility evaluation approach, we conduct an experimental study
using a SOTA method (CA-SUM) and two datasets (SumMe, TVSum) for video
summarization, to examine whether the more faithful explanations are also the
more plausible ones, and identify the most appropriate approach for generating
plausible textual explanations for video summarization.

Conclusion: MGCE通过自适应概念挖掘和专家协作，有效解决了开放世界中的类别发现问题，无需预先知道类别数量。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an open-world problem that clusters
unlabeled data by leveraging knowledge from partially labeled categories. A key
challenge is that unlabeled data may contain both known and novel categories.
Existing approaches suffer from two main limitations. First, they fail to
exploit multi-granularity conceptual information in visual data, which limits
representation quality. Second, most assume that the number of unlabeled
categories is known during training, which is impractical in real-world
scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a Multi-Granularity Conceptual
Experts (MGCE) framework that adaptively mines visual concepts and integrates
multi-granularity knowledge for accurate category discovery. MGCE consists of
two modules: (1) Dynamic Conceptual Contrastive Learning (DCCL), which
alternates between concept mining and dual-level representation learning to
jointly optimize feature learning and category discovery; and (2)
Multi-Granularity Experts Collaborative Learning (MECL), which extends the
single-expert paradigm by introducing additional experts at different
granularities and by employing a concept alignment matrix for effective
cross-expert collaboration. Importantly, MGCE can automatically estimate the
number of categories in unlabeled data, making it suitable for practical
open-world settings. Extensive experiments on nine fine-grained visual
recognition benchmarks demonstrate that MGCE achieves state-of-the-art results,
particularly in novel-class accuracy. Notably, even without prior knowledge of
category numbers, MGCE outperforms parametric approaches that require knowing
the exact number of categories, with an average improvement of 3.6\%. Code is

Conclusion: IMG是一种高效灵活的多模态对齐解决方案，显著提升了图像生成与提示的一致性。

Abstract: Ensuring precise multimodal alignment between diffusion-generated images and
input prompts has been a long-standing challenge. Earlier works finetune
diffusion weight using high-quality preference data, which tends to be limited
and difficult to scale up. Recent editing-based methods further refine local
regions of generated images but may compromise overall image quality. In this
work, we propose Implicit Multimodal Guidance (IMG), a novel
re-generation-based multimodal alignment framework that requires no extra data
or editing operations. Specifically, given a generated image and its prompt,
IMG a) utilizes a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to identify
misalignments; b) introduces an Implicit Aligner that manipulates diffusion
conditioning features to reduce misalignments and enable re-generation; and c)
formulates the re-alignment goal into a trainable objective, namely Iteratively
Updated Preference Objective. Extensive qualitative and quantitative
evaluations on SDXL, SDXL-DPO, and FLUX show that IMG outperforms existing
alignment methods. Furthermore, IMG acts as a flexible plug-and-play adapter,
seamlessly enhancing prior finetuning-based alignment methods. Our code will be
available at https://github.com/SHI-Labs/IMG-Multimodal-Diffusion-Alignment.

Abstract: Recent advances in Visually-rich Document Understanding rely on large
Vision-Language Models like Donut, which perform document-level Visual Question
Answering without Optical Character Recognition. Despite their effectiveness,
these models are too costly for real-time or resource-constrained applications.
We investigate model compression through knowledge distillation, training
compact student models from a larger teacher. We leverage mechanistic
interpretability to drive student architecture design within this framework. By
analyzing internal computations, we identify essential subcomponents to retain,
while having a clear view of which subcomponents should be approximated,
skipped, or reparametrized based on their function. This approach yields
Donut-MINT (Mechanistic Interpretability-based Network Trimming), a pruned
Donut variant that reduces inference time and memory usage while maintaining
strong performance on DocVQA, a standard benchmark for document Visual Question
Answering. Our method reframes compression as circuit discovery, bridging
interpretability research and practical Vision-Language Model deployment.

Conclusion: 几何感知建模、时间一致性和显式推理的结合能有效增强具身智能的稳健性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Latent Action Models (LAMs) enable Vision- Language-Action (VLA) systems to
learn semantic action rep- resentations from large-scale unannotated data. Yet,
we identify two bottlenecks of LAMs: 1) the commonly adopted end-to-end trained
image encoder suffers from poor spatial understanding; 2) LAMs can be fragile
when input frames are distant, leading to limited temporal perception. Such
factors inevitably hinder stable and clear action modeling. To this end, we
propose Farsighted-LAM, a latent action framework with geometry- aware spatial
encoding and multi-scale temporal modeling, capturing structural priors and
dynamic motion patterns from consecutive frames. We further propose SSM-VLA, an
end- to-end VLA framework built upon Farsighted-LAM, which integrates
structured perception with a visual Chain-of-Thought module to explicitly
reason about environmental dynamics, enhancing decision consistency and
interpretability. We validate SSM-VLA on multiple VLA tasks in both simulation
and real- world settings, and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Our results
demonstrate that our strategy of combining geometry- aware modeling, temporal
coherence, and explicit reasoning is effective in enhancing the robustness and

*Tuan Nguyen,Naseem Khan,Khang Tran,NhatHai Phan,Issa Khalil*

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的强化学习算法PRPO，用于提升多模态大语言模型在深度伪造检测中的性能，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度伪造检测面临数据集稀缺和大语言模型推理与视觉证据不匹配的问题，需要一种新方法来提升检测的可靠性和可解释性。

Method: 引入了一个带推理标注的数据集，并提出了段落级相对策略优化（PRPO）算法，通过强化学习对齐大语言模型的推理与图像内容。

Result: PRPO显著提升了检测准确率，推理得分达到4.55/5.0，且在测试条件下明显优于GRPO。

Conclusion: 研究表明，将多模态推理与视觉证据对齐是实现可靠且可解释的深度伪造检测的关键。

Abstract: The rapid rise of synthetic media has made deepfake detection a critical
challenge for online safety and trust. Progress remains constrained by the
scarcity of large, high-quality datasets. Although multimodal large language
models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their performance on
deepfake detection is poor, often producing explanations that are misaligned
with visual evidence or hallucinatory. To address this limitation, we introduce
a reasoning-annotated dataset for deepfake detection and propose
Paragraph-level Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a reinforcement learning
algorithm that aligns LLM reasoning with image content at the paragraph level.
Experiments show that PRPO improves detection accuracy by a wide margin and
achieves the highest reasoning score of 4.55/5.0. Ablation studies further
demonstrate that PRPO significantly outperforms GRPO under test-time
conditions. These results underscore the importance of grounding multimodal
reasoning in visual evidence to enable more reliable and interpretable deepfake
detection.

*Ali Zoljodi,Radu Timofte,Masoud Daneshtalab*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于聚类的仿射变换（CAT）方法，用于提升低比特后训练量化（PTQ）的准确性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低比特PTQ容易导致精度下降，传统仿射变换方法效果不佳。

Method: 采用聚类特定的参数来对齐量化输出与全精度输出，无需微调模型。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上表现优异，W2A2 ResNet-18达到53.18% Top-1准确率，且可提升现有基线3%以上。

Conclusion: CAT是一种高效且轻量的PTQ改进方法，适用于多种架构和低比特设置。

Abstract: Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) reduces the memory footprint and
computational overhead of deep neural networks by converting full-precision
(FP) values into quantized and compressed data types. While PTQ is more
cost-efficient than Quantization-Aware Training (QAT), it is highly susceptible
to accuracy degradation under a low-bit quantization (LQ) regime (e.g., 2-bit).
Affine transformation is a classical technique used to reduce the discrepancy
between the information processed by a quantized model and that processed by
its full-precision counterpart; however, we find that using plain affine
transformation, which applies a uniform affine parameter set for all outputs,
worsens the results in low-bit PTQ. To address this, we propose Cluster-based
Affine Transformation (CAT), an error-reduction framework that employs
cluster-specific parameters to align LQ outputs with FP counterparts. CAT
refines LQ outputs with only a negligible number of additional parameters,
without requiring fine-tuning of the model or quantization parameters. We
further introduce a novel PTQ framework integrated with CAT. Experiments on
ImageNet-1K show that this framework consistently outperforms prior PTQ methods
across diverse architectures and LQ settings, achieving up to 53.18% Top-1
accuracy on W2A2 ResNet-18. Moreover, CAT enhances existing PTQ baselines by
more than 3% when used as a plug-in. We plan to release our implementation
alongside the publication of this paper.

TL;DR: ProfVLM是一个紧凑的视觉语言模型，通过生成式推理预测技能水平并生成专家反馈，优于现有方法且更高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技能熟练度估计方法依赖黑盒视频分类器，缺乏多视角上下文和可解释性。

Method: 使用AttentiveGatedProjector动态融合多视角特征，结合冻结的TimeSformer主干和语言模型生成反馈。

Result: 在EgoExo4D数据集上训练，ProfVLM性能优于现有方法，参数减少20倍，训练时间减少60%。

Conclusion: 生成式视觉语言建模是技能评估的新方向，兼具高准确性和透明推理。

Abstract: Existing approaches to skill proficiency estimation often rely on black-box
video classifiers, ignoring multi-view context and lacking explainability. We
present ProfVLM, a compact vision-language model that reformulates this task as
generative reasoning: it jointly predicts skill level and generates expert-like
feedback from egocentric and exocentric videos. Central to our method is an
AttentiveGatedProjector that dynamically fuses multi-view features, projected
from a frozen TimeSformer backbone into a language model tuned for feedback
generation. Trained on EgoExo4D with expert commentaries, ProfVLM surpasses
state-of-the-art methods while using up to 20x fewer parameters and reducing
training time by up to 60%. Our approach not only achieves superior accuracy
across diverse activities, but also outputs natural language critiques aligned
with performance, offering transparent reasoning. These results highlight
generative vision-language modeling as a powerful new direction for skill
assessment.

TL;DR: Point2RBox-v3通过渐进式标签分配和先验引导动态掩码损失，解决了现有点监督方法中伪标签利用效率低和质量差的问题，在稀疏和密集场景中均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有点监督方法存在伪标签利用效率低和质量差的问题，限制了面向对象检测的性能。

Method: 提出渐进式标签分配（PLA）和先验引导动态掩码损失（PGDM-Loss），动态估计实例大小并优化伪标签生成。

Result: 在多个数据集（DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR）上表现优异，尤其在大尺寸变化或稀疏场景中。

Conclusion: Point2RBox-v3通过动态伪标签和结合SAM与分水岭算法，显著提升了面向对象检测的性能。

Abstract: Driven by the growing need for Oriented Object Detection (OOD), learning from
point annotations under a weakly-supervised framework has emerged as a
promising alternative to costly and laborious manual labeling. In this paper,
we discuss two deficiencies in existing point-supervised methods: inefficient
utilization and poor quality of pseudo labels. Therefore, we present
Point2RBox-v3. At the core are two principles: 1) Progressive Label Assignment
(PLA). It dynamically estimates instance sizes in a coarse yet intelligent
manner at different stages of the training process, enabling the use of label
assignment methods. 2) Prior-Guided Dynamic Mask Loss (PGDM-Loss). It is an
enhancement of the Voronoi Watershed Loss from Point2RBox-v2, which overcomes
the shortcomings of Watershed in its poor performance in sparse scenes and
SAM's poor performance in dense scenes. To our knowledge, Point2RBox-v3 is the
first model to employ dynamic pseudo labels for label assignment, and it
creatively complements the advantages of SAM model with the watershed
algorithm, which achieves excellent performance in both sparse and dense
scenes. Our solution gives competitive performance, especially in scenarios
with large variations in object size or sparse object occurrences:
66.09%/56.86%/41.28%/46.40%/19.60%/45.96% on
DOTA-v1.0/DOTA-v1.5/DOTA-v2.0/DIOR/STAR/RSAR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决逆问题时，如何利用预训练模型生成与观测数据一致的重建结果，同时统一不同方法的理论视角。

Method: Flower通过三步迭代：流一致目标估计、可行集投影和时间推进，结合理论分析证明其近似贝叶斯后验采样。

Result: Flower在多种逆问题上实现了最先进的重建质量，且超参数几乎一致。

Conclusion: Flower不仅高效解决了逆问题，还统一了不同方法的理论框架，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: We introduce Flower, a solver for inverse problems. It leverages a
pre-trained flow model to produce reconstructions that are consistent with the
observed measurements. Flower operates through an iterative procedure over
three steps: (i) a flow-consistent destination estimation, where the velocity
network predicts a denoised target; (ii) a refinement step that projects the
estimated destination onto a feasible set defined by the forward operator; and
(iii) a time-progression step that re-projects the refined destination along
the flow trajectory. We provide a theoretical analysis that demonstrates how
Flower approximates Bayesian posterior sampling, thereby unifying perspectives
from plug-and-play methods and generative inverse solvers. On the practical
side, Flower achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality while using
nearly identical hyperparameters across various inverse problems.

*Alexander Becker,Julius Erbach,Dominik Narnhofer,Konrad Schindler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D视频傅里叶场（VFF）的连续时空视频超分辨率方法，避免了显式帧变形，实现了高效、灵活的空间和时间采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将视频分解为空间和时间组件，依赖脆弱的显式帧变形进行运动补偿，效果不佳。

Method: 使用神经编码器预测傅里叶基系数，通过3D VFF实现连续时空建模，支持任意尺度的抗锯齿重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，空间和时间超分辨率效果显著提升，计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法通过联合建模显著提升了视频超分辨率的性能，成为新的技术标杆。

Abstract: We introduce a novel formulation for continuous space-time video
super-resolution. Instead of decoupling the representation of a video sequence
into separate spatial and temporal components and relying on brittle, explicit
frame warping for motion compensation, we encode video as a continuous,
spatio-temporally coherent 3D Video Fourier Field (VFF). That representation
offers three key advantages: (1) it enables cheap, flexible sampling at
arbitrary locations in space and time; (2) it is able to simultaneously capture
fine spatial detail and smooth temporal dynamics; and (3) it offers the
possibility to include an analytical, Gaussian point spread function in the
sampling to ensure aliasing-free reconstruction at arbitrary scale. The
coefficients of the proposed, Fourier-like sinusoidal basis are predicted with
a neural encoder with a large spatio-temporal receptive field, conditioned on
the low-resolution input video. Through extensive experiments, we show that our
joint modeling substantially improves both spatial and temporal
super-resolution and sets a new state of the art for multiple benchmarks:
across a wide range of upscaling factors, it delivers sharper and temporally
more consistent reconstructions than existing baselines, while being
computationally more efficient. Project page: https://v3vsr.github.io.

*Ren-Di Wu,Yu-Yen Lin,Huei-Fang Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SQUARE是一个无需训练的两阶段框架，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）提升零样本组合图像检索（ZS-CIR）性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本组合图像检索中用户意图捕捉不准确的问题。

Method: 分为两阶段：语义查询增强融合（SQAF）和高效批量重排序（EBR）。

Result: 在四个标准CIR基准测试中表现优异，且适用于轻量级预训练模型。

Conclusion: SQUARE简单有效，具有广泛适用潜力。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve target images that preserve
the visual content of a reference image while incorporating user-specified
textual modifications. Training-free zero-shot CIR (ZS-CIR) approaches, which
require no task-specific training or labeled data, are highly desirable, yet
accurately capturing user intent remains challenging. In this paper, we present
SQUARE, a novel two-stage training-free framework that leverages Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance ZS-CIR. In the Semantic
Query-Augmented Fusion (SQAF) stage, we enrich the query embedding derived from
a vision-language model (VLM) such as CLIP with MLLM-generated captions of the
target image. These captions provide high-level semantic guidance, enabling the
query to better capture the user's intent and improve global retrieval quality.
In the Efficient Batch Reranking (EBR) stage, top-ranked candidates are
presented as an image grid with visual marks to the MLLM, which performs joint
visual-semantic reasoning across all candidates. Our reranking strategy
operates in a single pass and yields more accurate rankings. Experiments show
that SQUARE, with its simplicity and effectiveness, delivers strong performance
on four standard CIR benchmarks. Notably, it maintains high performance even
with lightweight pre-trained, demonstrating its potential applicability.

Motivation: 开源模型在图像编辑任务中缺乏高质量合成训练数据，\mname旨在解决这一问题。

Result: \mname在多个基准测试中表现最优，并能筛选高质量训练数据。

Conclusion: \mname可作为奖励模型提升训练数据质量，并有望用于强化学习等高级应用。

Abstract: Recently, we have witnessed great progress in image editing with natural
language instructions. Several closed-source models like GPT-Image-1, Seedream,
and Google-Nano-Banana have shown highly promising progress. However, the
open-source models are still lagging. The main bottleneck is the lack of a
reliable reward model to scale up high-quality synthetic training data. To
address this critical bottleneck, we built \mname, trained with our new
large-scale human preference dataset, meticulously annotated by trained experts
following a rigorous protocol containing over 200K preference pairs. \mname
demonstrates superior alignment with human preferences in instruction-guided
image editing tasks. Experiments show that \mname achieves state-of-the-art
human correlation on established benchmarks such as GenAI-Bench, AURORA-Bench,
ImagenHub, and our new \benchname, outperforming a wide range of VLM-as-judge
models. Furthermore, we use \mname to select a high-quality subset from the
existing noisy ShareGPT-4o-Image dataset. We train Step1X-Edit on the selected
subset, which shows significant improvement over training on the full set. This
demonstrates \mname's ability to serve as a reward model to scale up
high-quality training data for image editing. Furthermore, its strong alignment
suggests potential for advanced applications like reinforcement learning-based
post-training and test-time scaling of image editing models. \mname with its
training dataset will be released to help the community build more high-quality
image editing training datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了任务导向的时间定位问题（ToTG）及相应基准ToTG Bench，并提出了TimeScope框架，通过渐进式推理解决长视频中的关键时刻定位问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在长视频中定位关键时刻时泛化能力有限，难以处理复杂任务描述。

Method: TimeScope框架采用渐进式推理，先粗粒度定位时间范围，再细粒度划分关键时刻。

Result: TimeScope在多种设置下优于现有方法和多模态大模型。

Conclusion: TimeScope有效解决了任务导向的时间定位问题，并在新基准上表现优异。

Abstract: Identifying key moments in long videos is essential for downstream
understanding and reasoning tasks. In this paper, we introduce a new problem,
Taskoriented Temporal Grounding ToTG, which aims to localize time intervals
containing the necessary information based on a task's natural description.
Along with the definition, we also present ToTG Bench, a comprehensive
benchmark for evaluating the performance on ToTG. ToTG is particularly
challenging for traditional approaches due to their limited generalizability
and difficulty in handling long videos. To address these challenges, we propose
TimeScope, a novel framework built upon progressive reasoning. TimeScope first
identifies a coarse-grained temporal scope in the long video that likely
contains the key moments, and then refines this scope through finegrained
moment partitioning. Additionally, we curate a highquality dataset, namely ToTG
Pile, to enhance TimeScope's ability to perform progressive temporal grounding
effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TimeScope consistently
outperforms both existing temporalgrounding methods and popular MLLMs across
various settings, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing this new
challenging problem.

TL;DR: ScalingAR是首个专为基于NTP的自回归图像生成设计的TTS框架，无需早期解码或辅助奖励，显著提升性能并减少计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTS方法在视觉自回归生成中因依赖部分解码和外部奖励模型而不适用，需解决这一问题。

Method: 利用令牌熵作为新信号，通过配置文件和策略级别的动态调整优化生成过程。

Result: 在通用和组合基准测试中，性能提升12.5%-15.2%，令牌消耗减少62.0%，鲁棒性增强26.0%。

Conclusion: ScalingAR为NTP自回归图像生成提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing
large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP)
autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS
approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and
external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to
the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this
gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for
NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or
auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in
visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i)
Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic
and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to
adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule
guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both
general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base
models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces
visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3)
successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in
challenging scenarios.

Result: 在多种场景和复杂设置下，PANDA实现了最先进的性能，无需训练和人工干预。

Conclusion: PANDA展示了通用化和鲁棒的异常检测能力，为视频异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a critical yet challenging task due to the
complex and diverse nature of real-world scenarios. Previous methods typically
rely on domain-specific training data and manual adjustments when applying to
new scenarios and unseen anomaly types, suffering from high labor costs and
limited generalization. Therefore, we aim to achieve generalist VAD, i.e.,
automatically handle any scene and any anomaly types without training data or
human involvement. In this work, we propose PANDA, an agentic AI engineer based
on MLLMs. Specifically, we achieve PANDA by comprehensively devising four key
capabilities: (1) self-adaptive scene-aware strategy planning, (2) goal-driven
heuristic reasoning, (3) tool-augmented self-reflection, and (4) self-improving
chain-of-memory. Concretely, we develop a self-adaptive scene-aware RAG
mechanism, enabling PANDA to retrieve anomaly-specific knowledge for anomaly
detection strategy planning. Next, we introduce a latent anomaly-guided
heuristic prompt strategy to enhance reasoning precision. Furthermore, PANDA
employs a progressive reflection mechanism alongside a suite of context-aware
tools to iteratively refine decision-making in complex scenarios. Finally, a
chain-of-memory mechanism enables PANDA to leverage historical experiences for
continual performance improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PANDA
achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-scenario, open-set, and complex
scenario settings without training and manual involvement, validating its
generalizable and robust anomaly detection capability. Code is released at

Conclusion: MotionRAG通过模块化设计实现零样本泛化，有效提升视频生成系统的运动真实性和动态合成能力。

Abstract: Image-to-video generation has made remarkable progress with the advancements
in diffusion models, yet generating videos with realistic motion remains highly
challenging. This difficulty arises from the complexity of accurately modeling
motion, which involves capturing physical constraints, object interactions, and
domain-specific dynamics that are not easily generalized across diverse
scenarios. To address this, we propose MotionRAG, a retrieval-augmented
framework that enhances motion realism by adapting motion priors from relevant
reference videos through Context-Aware Motion Adaptation (CAMA). The key
technical innovations include: (i) a retrieval-based pipeline extracting
high-level motion features using video encoder and specialized resamplers to
distill semantic motion representations; (ii) an in-context learning approach
for motion adaptation implemented through a causal transformer architecture;
(iii) an attention-based motion injection adapter that seamlessly integrates
transferred motion features into pretrained video diffusion models. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements
across multiple domains and various base models, all with negligible
computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, our modular design
enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by simply updating the
retrieval database without retraining any components. This research enhances
the core capability of video generation systems by enabling the effective
retrieval and transfer of motion priors, facilitating the synthesis of
realistic motion dynamics.

Result: 实验证明了所提出的图像难度指标和评估方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能更好地区分视觉结果不同但平均分数相近的超分辨率模型。

Abstract: Image super-resolution models are commonly evaluated by average scores (over
some benchmark test sets), which fail to reflect the performance of these
models on images of varying difficulty and that some models generate artifacts
on certain difficult images, which is not reflected by the average scores. We
propose difficulty-aware performance evaluation procedures to better
differentiate between SISR models that produce visually different results on
some images but yield close average performance scores over the entire test
set. In particular, we propose two image-difficulty measures, the
high-frequency index and rotation-invariant edge index, to predict those test
images, where a model would yield significantly better visual results over
another model, and an evaluation method where these visual differences are
reflected on objective measures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed image-difficulty measures and evaluation
methodology.

Conclusion: PRISM通过渐进式框架和混合域建模，有效提升图像去雨效果。

Abstract: Image deraining is an essential vision technique that removes rain streaks
and water droplets, enhancing clarity for critical vision tasks like autonomous
driving. However, current single-scale models struggle with fine-grained
recovery and global consistency. To address this challenge, we propose
Progressive Rain removal with Integrated State-space Modeling (PRISM), a
progressive three-stage framework: Coarse Extraction Network (CENet), Frequency
Fusion Network (SFNet), and Refine Network (RNet). Specifically, CENet and
SFNet utilize a novel Hybrid Attention UNet (HA-UNet) for multi-scale feature
aggregation by combining channel attention with windowed spatial transformers.
Moreover, we propose Hybrid Domain Mamba (HDMamba) for SFNet to jointly model
spatial semantics and wavelet domain characteristics. Finally, RNet recovers
the fine-grained structures via an original-resolution subnetwork. Our model
learns high-frequency rain characteristics while preserving structural details
and maintaining global context, leading to improved image quality. Our method
achieves competitive results on multiple datasets against recent deraining
methods.

Method: 提出QuaRTZ方案，结合8位最小-最大量化处理异常值，并通过前导零抑制压缩至4位以保留最低有效位。

Result: 4位QuaRTZ在FLUX.1-schnell上FID达6.98，优于需FP16辅助分支的SVDQuant。

Conclusion: QuaRTZ通过平衡异常值保留和最低有效位精度，有效解决了4位量化中的纹理细节丢失问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but face deployment
challenges due to their high computational requirements. Although 8-bit
outlier-aware post-training quantization (PTQ) matches full-precision
performance, extending PTQ to 4 bits remains challenging. Larger step sizes in
4-bit quantization amplify rounding errors in dense, low-magnitude activations,
leading to the loss of fine-grained textures. We hypothesize that not only
outliers but also small activations are critical for texture fidelity. To this
end, we propose Quantization via Residual Truncation and Zero Suppression
(QuaRTZ), a 4-bit PTQ scheme for diffusion models. QuaRTZ applies 8-bit min-max
quantization for outlier handling and compresses to 4 bits via leading-zero
suppression to retain LSBs, thereby preserving texture details. Our approach
reduces rounding errors and improves quantization efficiency by balancing
outlier preservation and LSB precision. Both theoretical derivations and
empirical evaluations demonstrate the generalizability of QuaRTZ across diverse
activation distributions. Notably, 4-bit QuaRTZ achieves an FID of 6.98 on
FLUX.1-schnell, outperforming SVDQuant that requires auxiliary FP16 branches.

Motivation: 现代生产线中确保每辆车符合规格且无可见缺陷的复杂性日益增加。

Method: 使用11个同步摄像头捕获车辆360度视图，结合YOLOv8、EfficientNet、Gemini-1.5 Flash和YOLOv8-Seg等模块进行检测和分类，并通过规则引擎生成报告。

Result: 在混合数据集上，AVI达到93%验证准确率、86%缺陷检测召回率，并支持每分钟3.3辆车的处理速度。

Conclusion: AVI是首个公开报道的统一多摄像头特征验证与缺陷检测的可部署工业系统。

Abstract: Ensuring that every vehicle leaving a modern production line is built to the
correct \emph{variant} specification and is free from visible defects is an
increasingly complex challenge. We present the \textbf{Automated Vehicle
Inspection (AVI)} platform, an end-to-end, \emph{multi-view} perception system
that couples deep-learning detectors with a semantic rule engine to deliver
\emph{variant-aware} quality control in real time. Eleven synchronized cameras
capture a full 360{\deg} sweep of each vehicle; task-specific views are then
routed to specialised modules: YOLOv8 for part detection, EfficientNet for
ICE/EV classification, Gemini-1.5 Flash for mascot OCR, and YOLOv8-Seg for
scratch-and-dent segmentation. A view-aware fusion layer standardises evidence,
while a VIN-conditioned rule engine compares detected features against the
expected manifest, producing an interpretable pass/fail report in \(\approx\!
300\,\text{ms}\). On a mixed data set of Original Equipment Manufacturer(OEM)
vehicle data sets of four distinct models plus public scratch/dent images, AVI
achieves \textbf{ 93 \%} verification accuracy, \textbf{86 \%} defect-detection
recall, and sustains \(\mathbf{3.3}\) vehicles/min, surpassing single-view or
no segmentation baselines by large margins. To our knowledge, this is the first
publicly reported system that unifies multi-camera feature validation with
defect detection in a deployable automotive setting in industry.

*Hanzhou Liu,Jia Huang,Mi Lu,Srikanth Saripalli,Peng Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stylos是一个单次前向的3D高斯框架，用于3D风格迁移，支持从单张图像到多视角集合的无姿态内容，并通过参考风格图像进行条件化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要逐场景优化或预计算姿态的问题，实现几何感知、视角一致的风格迁移，并推广到未见过的类别、场景和风格。

Method: 采用Transformer主干网络，分为几何预测和风格注入两条路径，结合基于体素的3D风格损失来保持几何保真度和视角一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上展示了高质量零样本风格化效果，验证了全局风格-内容耦合、3D风格损失的有效性以及框架的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Stylos通过创新的架构和损失设计，实现了高效、高质量的3D风格迁移，适用于从单视角到大规模多视角的场景。

Abstract: We present Stylos, a single-forward 3D Gaussian framework for 3D style
transfer that operates on unposed content, from a single image to a multi-view
collection, conditioned on a separate reference style image. Stylos synthesizes
a stylized 3D Gaussian scene without per-scene optimization or precomputed
poses, achieving geometry-aware, view-consistent stylization that generalizes
to unseen categories, scenes, and styles. At its core, Stylos adopts a
Transformer backbone with two pathways: geometry predictions retain
self-attention to preserve geometric fidelity, while style is injected via
global cross-attention to enforce visual consistency across views. With the
addition of a voxel-based 3D style loss that aligns aggregated scene features
to style statistics, Stylos enforces view-consistent stylization while
preserving geometry. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that
Stylos delivers high-quality zero-shot stylization, highlighting the
effectiveness of global style-content coupling, the proposed 3D style loss, and
the scalability of our framework from single view to large-scale multi-view
settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决室内场景分类中对象间复杂关系和空间布局的挑战，特别是敏感内容分析（如CSAI分类）。

Method: 将图像转换为场景图，利用图注意力网络建模场景组件间的交互。

Result: 在Places8上达到81.27%的平衡准确率，在CSAI分类中达到74.27%。

Conclusion: 结构化场景表示是室内场景分类和CSAI分类的强有力范式。

Abstract: Indoor scene classification is a critical task in computer vision, with
wide-ranging applications that go from robotics to sensitive content analysis,
such as child sexual abuse imagery (CSAI) classification. The problem is
particularly challenging due to the intricate relationships between objects and
complex spatial layouts. In this work, we propose the Attention over Scene
Graphs for Sensitive Content Analysis (ASGRA), a novel framework that operates
on structured graph representations instead of raw pixels. By first converting
images into Scene Graphs and then employing a Graph Attention Network for
inference, ASGRA directly models the interactions between a scene's components.
This approach offers two key benefits: (i) inherent explainability via object
and relationship identification, and (ii) privacy preservation, enabling model
training without direct access to sensitive images. On Places8, we achieve
81.27% balanced accuracy, surpassing image-based methods. Real-world CSAI
evaluation with law enforcement yields 74.27% balanced accuracy. Our results
establish structured scene representations as a robust paradigm for indoor
scene classification and CSAI classification. Code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 槟榔叶病害对经济影响大，传统方法难以及时识别，人工智能可提升病害预测效率。

Method: 结合CBAM注意力机制，增强特征提取能力，使用10,185张图像的数据集进行训练和验证。

Result: 模型在测试集上达到95.58%的准确率，精确度、召回率和F1分数均表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型轻量高效，适用于槟榔叶病害识别，且通过Grad-CAM技术增强了可解释性。

Abstract: Betel leaf is an important crop because of its economic advantages and
widespread use. Its betel vines are susceptible to a number of illnesses that
are commonly referred to as betel leaf disease. Plant diseases are the largest
threat to the food supply's security, and they are challenging to identify in
time to stop possible financial damage. Interestingly, artificial intelligence
can leave a big mark on the betel leaf industry since it helps with output
growth by forecasting sickness. This paper presents a lightweight CBAM-CNN
model with just 2.13 million parameters (8.13 MB), incorporating CBAM
(Convolutional Block Attention Module) to improve feature emphasis without
depending on heavy pre-trained networks. The model's capacity to discern minute
variations among leaf disease classes is improved by the integrated attention
mechanism, which allows it to adaptively focus on significant spatial and
channel-wise information. In order to ensure class balance and diversity for
efficient model training and validation, this work makes use of an enriched
dataset of 10,185 images divided into three categories: Healthy Leaf, Leaf Rot,
and Leaf Spot. The proposed model achieved a precision of 97%, recall of 94%,
and F1 score of 95%, and 95.58% accuracy on the test set demonstrating strong
and balanced classification performance outperforming traditional pre trained
CNN models. The model's focus regions were visualized and interpreted using
Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), an explainable AI
technique.

Motivation: 传统方法在从运动轨迹重建空间布局时存在不稳定性，因为路径规划过程是非可逆且不可微的。

Method: 采用扩散后验采样，并在嵌入空间中重新定义似然分数，通过对比损失训练嵌入空间。

Result: 提出的CoGuide模型在实验中表现优于基线方法，生成更一致的平面图。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入空间中的替代似然分数，能够有效引导去噪过程，实现更稳健的空间布局重建。

Abstract: We consider the inverse problem of reconstructing the spatial layout of a
place, a home floorplan for example, from a user`s movements inside that
layout. Direct inversion is ill-posed since many floorplans can explain the
same movement trajectories. We adopt a diffusion-based posterior sampler to
generate layouts consistent with the measurements. While active research is in
progress on generative inverse solvers, we find that the forward operator in
our problem poses new challenges. The path-planning process inside a floorplan
is a non-invertible, non-differentiable function, and causes instability while
optimizing using the likelihood score. We break-away from existing approaches
and reformulate the likelihood score in a smoother embedding space. The
embedding space is trained with a contrastive loss which brings compatible
floorplans and trajectories close to each other, while pushing mismatched pairs
far apart. We show that a surrogate form of the likelihood score in this
embedding space is a valid approximation of the true likelihood score, making
it possible to steer the denoising process towards the posterior. Across
extensive experiments, our model CoGuide produces more consistent floorplans
from trajectories, and is more robust than differentiable-planner baselines and
guided-diffusion methods.

Result: 模型在十亿参数规模中达到最优性能，在严格硬件限制下表现优异。

Conclusion: 为边缘设备开发高性能语言模型提供了实用高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has significantly
advanced the capabilities of artificial intelligence across various domains.
However, their massive scale and high computational costs render them
unsuitable for direct deployment in resource-constrained edge environments.
This creates a critical need for high-performance small models that can operate
efficiently at the edge. Yet, after pre-training alone, these smaller models
often fail to meet the performance requirements of complex tasks. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a systematic post-training pipeline that efficiently
enhances small model accuracy. Our post training pipeline consists of
curriculum-based supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and offline on-policy knowledge
distillation. The resulting instruction-tuned model achieves state-of-the-art
performance among billion-parameter models, demonstrating strong generalization
under strict hardware constraints while maintaining competitive accuracy across
a variety of tasks. This work provides a practical and efficient solution for
developing high-performance language models on Ascend edge devices.

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，RMSE 和 Rel 平均提升 22% 和 11%，在镜面区域提升 37%。

Conclusion: DEPTHOR++ 能够显著提升低成本传感器的性能，具有广泛的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Depth enhancement, which converts raw dToF signals into dense depth maps
using RGB guidance, is crucial for improving depth perception in high-precision
tasks such as 3D reconstruction and SLAM. However, existing methods often
assume ideal dToF inputs and perfect dToF-RGB alignment, overlooking
calibration errors and anomalies, thus limiting real-world applicability. This
work systematically analyzes the noise characteristics of real-world
lightweight dToF sensors and proposes a practical and novel depth completion
framework, DEPTHOR++, which enhances robustness to noisy dToF inputs from three
key aspects. First, we introduce a simulation method based on synthetic
datasets to generate realistic training samples for robust model training.
Second, we propose a learnable-parameter-free anomaly detection mechanism to
identify and remove erroneous dToF measurements, preventing misleading
propagation during completion. Third, we design a depth completion network
tailored to noisy dToF inputs, which integrates RGB images and pre-trained
monocular depth estimation priors to improve depth recovery in challenging
regions. On the ZJU-L5 dataset and real-world samples, our training strategy
significantly boosts existing depth completion models, with our model achieving
state-of-the-art performance, improving RMSE and Rel by 22% and 11% on average.
On the Mirror3D-NYU dataset, by incorporating the anomaly detection method, our
model improves upon the previous SOTA by 37% in mirror regions. On the Hammer
dataset, using simulated low-cost dToF data from RealSense L515, our method
surpasses the L515 measurements with an average gain of 22%, demonstrating its
potential to enable low-cost sensors to outperform higher-end devices.
Qualitative results across diverse real-world datasets further validate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型和基准未能满足专业视频生成的复杂需求，因此需要一种更结构化的评估方法。

Method: 提出了四个分类（Setup、Event、Lighting、Camera），构建了专业用例的基准，并通过自动化流程和人类研究进行评估。

Result: 当前最强模型在事件和摄像机相关控制上仍有显著差距，训练了一个优于零样本基线的自动评估器。

Conclusion: SCINE 是首个围绕电影控制分类的专业视频生成评估方法，为未来研究提供了结构化分析和指导。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled high-fidelity video
synthesis from user provided prompts. However, existing models and benchmarks
fail to capture the complexity and requirements of professional video
generation. Towards that goal, we introduce Stable Cinemetrics, a structured
evaluation framework that formalizes filmmaking controls into four
disentangled, hierarchical taxonomies: Setup, Event, Lighting, and Camera.
Together, these taxonomies define 76 fine-grained control nodes grounded in
industry practices. Using these taxonomies, we construct a benchmark of prompts
aligned with professional use cases and develop an automated pipeline for
prompt categorization and question generation, enabling independent evaluation
of each control dimension. We conduct a large-scale human study spanning 10+
models and 20K videos, annotated by a pool of 80+ film professionals. Our
analysis, both coarse and fine-grained reveal that even the strongest current
models exhibit significant gaps, particularly in Events and Camera-related
controls. To enable scalable evaluation, we train an automatic evaluator, a
vision-language model aligned with expert annotations that outperforms existing
zero-shot baselines. SCINE is the first approach to situate professional video
generation within the landscape of video generative models, introducing
taxonomies centered around cinematic controls and supporting them with
structured evaluation pipelines and detailed analyses to guide future research.

Conclusion: 机器学习模型能有效优化连接组学中的校对流程，显著提升效率和降低成本。

Abstract: Producing connectomes from electron microscopy (EM) images has historically
required a great deal of human proofreading effort. This manual annotation cost
is the current bottleneck in scaling EM connectomics, for example, in making
larger connectome reconstructions feasible, or in enabling comparative
connectomics where multiple related reconstructions are produced. In this work,
we propose using the available ground-truth data generated by this manual
annotation effort to learn a machine learning model to automate or optimize
parts of the required proofreading workflows. We validate our approach on a
recent complete reconstruction of the \emph{Drosophila} male central nervous
system. We first show our method would allow for obtaining 90\% of the value of
a guided proofreading workflow while reducing required cost by 80\%. We then
demonstrate a second application for automatically merging many segmentation
fragments to proofread neurons. Our system is able to automatically attach 200
thousand fragments, equivalent to four proofreader years of manual work, and
increasing the connectivity completion rate of the connectome by 1.3\% points.

Motivation: 解决图像拍摄后景深效果固定难以修改的问题，尤其是主体失焦时。

Method: 设计扩散变换器框架，通过模拟数据训练，引入堆叠约束确保物理正确的景深行为。

Result: DiffCamera支持广泛场景的稳定重聚焦，提供前所未有的景深控制能力。

Conclusion: DiffCamera为摄影和生成AI应用提供了高效的景深调整解决方案。

Abstract: The depth-of-field (DoF) effect, which introduces aesthetically pleasing
blur, enhances photographic quality but is fixed and difficult to modify once
the image has been created. This becomes problematic when the applied blur is
undesirable~(e.g., the subject is out of focus). To address this, we propose
DiffCamera, a model that enables flexible refocusing of a created image
conditioned on an arbitrary new focus point and a blur level. Specifically, we
design a diffusion transformer framework for refocusing learning. However, the
training requires pairs of data with different focus planes and bokeh levels in
the same scene, which are hard to acquire. To overcome this limitation, we
develop a simulation-based pipeline to generate large-scale image pairs with
varying focus planes and bokeh levels. With the simulated data, we find that
training with only a vanilla diffusion objective often leads to incorrect DoF
behaviors due to the complexity of the task. This requires a stronger
constraint during training. Inspired by the photographic principle that photos
of different focus planes can be linearly blended into a multi-focus image, we
propose a stacking constraint during training to enforce precise DoF
manipulation. This constraint enhances model training by imposing physically
grounded refocusing behavior that the focusing results should be faithfully
aligned with the scene structure and the camera conditions so that they can be
combined into the correct multi-focus image. We also construct a benchmark to
evaluate the effectiveness of our refocusing model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DiffCamera supports stable refocusing across a wide range of
scenes, providing unprecedented control over DoF adjustments for photography
and generative AI applications.

Conclusion: SAGANet为可控、高保真Foley合成设定了新标准，支持进一步研究分割感知音频生成。

Abstract: Existing multimodal audio generation models often lack precise user control,
which limits their applicability in professional Foley workflows. In
particular, these models focus on the entire video and do not provide precise
methods for prioritizing a specific object within a scene, generating
unnecessary background sounds, or focusing on the wrong objects. To address
this gap, we introduce the novel task of video object segmentation-aware audio
generation, which explicitly conditions sound synthesis on object-level
segmentation maps. We present SAGANet, a new multimodal generative model that
enables controllable audio generation by leveraging visual segmentation masks
along with video and textual cues. Our model provides users with fine-grained
and visually localized control over audio generation. To support this task and
further research on segmentation-aware Foley, we propose Segmented Music Solos,
a benchmark dataset of musical instrument performance videos with segmentation
information. Our method demonstrates substantial improvements over current
state-of-the-art methods and sets a new standard for controllable,
high-fidelity Foley synthesis. Code, samples, and Segmented Music Solos are

Conclusion: 降维是提升特征质量和分类性能的关键步骤。

Abstract: Facial expression classification remains a challenging task due to the high
dimensionality and inherent complexity of facial image data. This paper
presents Hy-Facial, a hybrid feature extraction framework that integrates both
deep learning and traditional image processing techniques, complemented by a
systematic investigation of dimensionality reduction strategies. The proposed
method fuses deep features extracted from the Visual Geometry Group 19-layer
network (VGG19) with handcrafted local descriptors and the scale-invariant
feature transform (SIFT) and Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB) algorithms,
to obtain rich and diverse image representations. To mitigate feature
redundancy and reduce computational complexity, we conduct a comprehensive
evaluation of dimensionality reduction techniques and feature extraction. Among
these, UMAP is identified as the most effective, preserving both local and
global structures of the high-dimensional feature space. The Hy-Facial pipeline
integrated VGG19, SIFT, and ORB for feature extraction, followed by K-means
clustering and UMAP for dimensionality reduction, resulting in a classification
accuracy of 83. 3\% in the facial expression recognition (FER) dataset. These
findings underscore the pivotal role of dimensionality reduction not only as a
pre-processing step but as an essential component in improving feature quality
and overall classification performance.

Abstract: Panorama has a full FoV (360$^\circ\times$180$^\circ$), offering a more
complete visual description than perspective images. Thanks to this
characteristic, panoramic depth estimation is gaining increasing traction in 3D
vision. However, due to the scarcity of panoramic data, previous methods are
often restricted to in-domain settings, leading to poor zero-shot
generalization. Furthermore, due to the spherical distortions inherent in
panoramas, many approaches rely on perspective splitting (e.g., cubemaps),
which leads to suboptimal efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose
$\textbf{DA}$$^{\textbf{2}}$: $\textbf{D}$epth $\textbf{A}$nything in
$\textbf{A}$ny $\textbf{D}$irection, an accurate, zero-shot generalizable, and
fully end-to-end panoramic depth estimator. Specifically, for scaling up
panoramic data, we introduce a data curation engine for generating high-quality
panoramic depth data from perspective, and create $\sim$543K panoramic
RGB-depth pairs, bringing the total to $\sim$607K. To further mitigate the
spherical distortions, we present SphereViT, which explicitly leverages
spherical coordinates to enforce the spherical geometric consistency in
panoramic image features, yielding improved performance. A comprehensive
benchmark on multiple datasets clearly demonstrates DA$^{2}$'s SoTA
performance, with an average 38% improvement on AbsRel over the strongest
zero-shot baseline. Surprisingly, DA$^{2}$ even outperforms prior in-domain
methods, highlighting its superior zero-shot generalization. Moreover, as an
end-to-end solution, DA$^{2}$ exhibits much higher efficiency over fusion-based
approaches. Both the code and the curated panoramic data will be released.

representation for photorealistic novel-view rendering. Prior methods for
clothed human reconstruction either optimize parametric templates, which
overlook loose garments and human-object interactions, or train implicit
functions under simplified camera assumptions, limiting applicability in real
scenes. In contrast, HART predicts per-pixel 3D point maps, normals, and body
correspondences, and employs an occlusion-aware Poisson reconstruction to
recover complete geometry, even in self-occluded regions. These predictions
also align with a parametric SMPL-X body model, ensuring that reconstructed
geometry remains consistent with human structure while capturing loose clothing
and interactions. These human-aligned meshes initialize Gaussian splats to
further enable sparse-view rendering. While trained on only 2.3K synthetic
scans, HART achieves state-of-the-art results: Chamfer Distance improves by
18-23 percent for clothed-mesh reconstruction, PA-V2V drops by 6-27 percent for
SMPL-X estimation, LPIPS decreases by 15-27 percent for novel-view synthesis on
a wide range of datasets. These results suggest that feed-forward transformers
can serve as a scalable model for robust human reconstruction in real-world
settings. Code and models will be released.

### [130] [Learning Generalizable Shape Completion with SIM(3) Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26631)
*Yuqing Wang,Zhaiyu Chen,Xiao Xiang Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种SIM(3)-等变的三维形状补全网络，通过消除姿态和尺度线索，提升了模型在真实数据中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预对齐的扫描数据，导致模型可能利用姿态和尺度线索而非内在几何信息，从而在真实数据中表现不佳。

Method: 设计了一个模块化的SIM(3)-等变网络，逐步规范化特征、推理相似性不变的几何信息，并恢复原始框架。

Result: 在去偏置的评估协议下，模型在PCN基准测试中优于基线，并在KITTI和OmniObject3D数据集上分别降低了17%和14%的误差。

Conclusion: SIM(3)等变性是实现真正泛化性形状补全的有效途径。

Abstract: 3D shape completion methods typically assume scans are pre-aligned to a
canonical frame. This leaks pose and scale cues that networks may exploit to
memorize absolute positions rather than inferring intrinsic geometry. When such
alignment is absent in real data, performance collapses. We argue that robust
generalization demands architectural equivariance to the similarity group,
SIM(3), so the model remains agnostic to pose and scale. Following this
principle, we introduce the first SIM(3)-equivariant shape completion network,
whose modular layers successively canonicalize features, reason over
similarity-invariant geometry, and restore the original frame. Under a
de-biased evaluation protocol that removes the hidden cues, our model
outperforms both equivariant and augmentation baselines on the PCN benchmark.
It also sets new cross-domain records on real driving and indoor scans,
lowering minimal matching distance on KITTI by 17% and Chamfer distance $\ell1$
on OmniObject3D by 14%. Perhaps surprisingly, ours under the stricter protocol
still outperforms competitors under their biased settings. These results
establish full SIM(3) equivariance as an effective route to truly generalizable
shape completion. Project page: https://sime-completion.github.io.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Query-Kontext方法通过多模态上下文连接VLM和扩散模型，提升生成推理能力，同时保持高质量视觉合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一框架中多模态生成推理能力与高保真合成能力纠缠，限制了性能。

Method: 提出三阶段渐进训练策略，结合轻量级扩散头、预训练扩散模型和低层图像编码器。

Result: 实验表明，该方法与统一基线相当，并在某些任务中超越特定任务的最先进方法。

Conclusion: Query-Kontext有效分离生成推理与视觉合成，提升了多模态生成任务的性能。

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation (T2I) and editing (TI2I), whether instantiated as
assembled unified frameworks which couple powerful vision-language model (VLM)
with diffusion-based generator, or as naive Unified Multimodal Models with an
early fusion of understanding and generation modalities. We contend that in
current unified frameworks, the crucial capability of multimodal generative
reasoning which encompasses instruction understanding, grounding, and image
referring for identity preservation and faithful reconstruction, is
intrinsically entangled with high-fidelity synthesis. In this work, we
introduce Query-Kontext, a novel approach that bridges the VLM and diffusion
model via a multimodal ``kontext'' composed of semantic cues and coarse-grained
image conditions encoded from multimodal inputs. This design delegates the
complex ability of multimodal generative reasoning to powerful VLM while
reserving diffusion model's role for high-quality visual synthesis. To achieve
this, we propose a three-stage progressive training strategy. First, we connect
the VLM to a lightweight diffusion head via multimodal kontext tokens to
unleash the VLM's generative reasoning ability. Second, we scale this head to a
large, pre-trained diffusion model to enhance visual detail and realism.
Finally, we introduce a low-level image encoder to improve image fidelity and
perform instruction tuning on downstream tasks. Furthermore, we build a
comprehensive data pipeline integrating real, synthetic, and open-source
datasets, covering diverse multimodal reference-to-image scenarios, including
image generation, instruction-driven editing, customized generation, and
multi-subject composition. Experiments show that our approach matches strong
unified baselines and even outperforms task-specific state-of-the-art methods
in several cases.

*Jessica Bader,Mateusz Pach,Maria A. Bravo,Serge Belongie,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stitch是一种无需训练的方法，通过自动生成的边界框将外部位置控制整合到多模态扩散变换器（MMDiT）中，显著提升了文本到图像生成模型的空间关系准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型在捕捉空间关系（如“上方”或“右侧”）方面存在挑战，且早期方法与现代模型不兼容。

Method: Stitch通过生成指定边界框内的单个对象并无缝拼接，结合目标注意力头捕获的信息，实现空间准确且视觉吸引人的图像生成。

Result: Stitch在PosEval基准测试中显著提升了基础模型性能，例如将FLUX在GenEval的Position任务上提升了218%，并在Qwen-Image上实现了54%的改进。

Conclusion: Stitch无需训练即可将位置控制整合到领先模型中，实现了最先进的性能，为空间关系生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation models have advanced rapidly in recent years,
but accurately capturing spatial relationships like "above" or "to the right
of" poses a persistent challenge. Earlier methods improved spatial relationship
following with external position control. However, as architectures evolved to
enhance image quality, these techniques became incompatible with modern models.
We propose Stitch, a training-free method for incorporating external position
control into Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) via
automatically-generated bounding boxes. Stitch produces images that are both
spatially accurate and visually appealing by generating individual objects
within designated bounding boxes and seamlessly stitching them together. We
find that targeted attention heads capture the information necessary to isolate
and cut out individual objects mid-generation, without needing to fully
complete the image. We evaluate Stitch on PosEval, our benchmark for
position-based T2I generation. Featuring five new tasks that extend the concept
of Position beyond the basic GenEval task, PosEval demonstrates that even top
models still have significant room for improvement in position-based
generation. Tested on Qwen-Image, FLUX, and SD3.5, Stitch consistently enhances
base models, even improving FLUX by 218% on GenEval's Position task and by 206%
on PosEval. Stitch achieves state-of-the-art results with Qwen-Image on
PosEval, improving over previous models by 54%, all accomplished while
integrating position control into leading models training-free. Code is

TL;DR: TTT3R通过在线学习视角改进3D重建模型，显著提升长度泛化能力，性能提升2倍，运行效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现代循环神经网络在超出训练上下文长度时性能显著下降的问题。

Method: 从Test-Time Training视角重新设计3D重建模型，利用内存状态与观测的对齐置信度动态调整学习率。

Result: 在全局姿态估计上性能提升2倍，运行效率达20 FPS，仅需6 GB GPU内存。

Conclusion: TTT3R是一种无需训练的高效干预方法，显著提升了模型的长度泛化能力。

Abstract: Modern Recurrent Neural Networks have become a competitive architecture for
3D reconstruction due to their linear-time complexity. However, their
performance degrades significantly when applied beyond the training context
length, revealing limited length generalization. In this work, we revisit the
3D reconstruction foundation models from a Test-Time Training perspective,
framing their designs as an online learning problem. Building on this
perspective, we leverage the alignment confidence between the memory state and
incoming observations to derive a closed-form learning rate for memory updates,
to balance between retaining historical information and adapting to new
observations. This training-free intervention, termed TTT3R, substantially
improves length generalization, achieving a $2\times$ improvement in global
pose estimation over baselines, while operating at 20 FPS with just 6 GB of GPU
memory to process thousands of images. Code available in

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UML-CoT利用UML结构化思维链，提升语言模型在具身任务中的可解释性和可执行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统思维链（CoT）依赖非结构化文本，限制了在具身任务中的可解释性和可执行性。现有结构化方法（如场景图或逻辑图）仅建模低阶关系，缺乏继承或行为抽象等构造，且无标准化语义。

Method: 提出UML-CoT框架，利用UML类图捕捉对象语义，活动图建模控制流。通过三阶段训练（监督微调+GRPO）结合答案数据奖励学习。

Result: 在MRoom-30k基准测试中，UML-CoT在可解释性、规划一致性和执行成功率上优于非结构化CoT。

Conclusion: UML是一种更具表达力和可操作性的结构化推理形式化方法。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning in large language models
(LLMs), but its reliance on unstructured text limits interpretability and
executability in embodied tasks. Prior work has explored structured CoTs using
scene or logic graphs, yet these remain fundamentally limited: they model only
low-order relations, lack constructs like inheritance or behavioral
abstraction, and provide no standardized semantics for sequential or
conditional planning. We propose UML-CoT, a structured reasoning and planning
framework that leverages Unified Modeling Language (UML) to generate symbolic
CoTs and executable action plans. UML class diagrams capture compositional
object semantics, while activity diagrams model procedural control flow. Our
three-stage training pipeline combines supervised fine-tuning with Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), including reward learning from answer-only
data. We evaluate UML-CoT on MRoom-30k, a new benchmark of cluttered
room-cleaning scenarios. UML-CoT outperforms unstructured CoTs in
interpretability, planning coherence, and execution success, highlighting UML
as a more expressive and actionable structured reasoning formalism.

models, whEE identifies key behavioral empathy cues in human interactions. We
evaluate it in human-robot interaction scenarios with our social robot, Haru.
Results show that whEE effectively identifies and responds to empathy cues,
providing valuable insights for designing social robots capable of adaptively
modulating their empathy levels across various interaction contexts.

TL;DR: BEV-VLM是一种利用鸟瞰图（BEV）特征图作为视觉输入的自驾轨迹规划框架，结合视觉语言模型（VLMs），显著提升了规划精度和避障能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖原始视觉数据（如相机图像），而BEV-VLM通过融合多模态传感器数据（如相机和LiDAR）并与高清地图对齐，生成高度压缩且信息丰富的BEV表示，为轨迹规划提供几何一致且丰富的场景描述。

Method: BEV-VLM利用BEV-HD Map格式作为视觉输入，通过VLMs进行轨迹规划。该方法在nuScenes数据集上验证了其有效性。

Result: 实验结果显示，规划精度提升了44.8%，并实现了完全避障。

Conclusion: 研究表明，VLMs能够有效解析BEV特征等处理后的视觉表示，扩展了其在轨迹规划中的应用范围。

Abstract: This paper introduces BEV-VLM, a novel framework for trajectory planning in
autonomous driving that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Bird's-Eye
View (BEV) feature maps as visual inputs. Unlike conventional approaches that
rely solely on raw visual data such as camera images, our method utilizes
highly compressed and informative BEV representations, which are generated by
fusing multi-modal sensor data (e.g., camera and LiDAR) and aligning them with
HD Maps. This unified BEV-HD Map format provides a geometrically consistent and
rich scene description, enabling VLMs to perform accurate trajectory planning.
Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate 44.8% improvements in
planning accuracy and complete collision avoidance. Our work highlights that
VLMs can effectively interpret processed visual representations like BEV
features, expanding their applicability beyond raw images in trajectory
planning.

TL;DR: SRMP是一个专为机器人操作设计的运动规划框架，提供一致且可靠的轨迹生成，支持多机器人任务，并与主流模拟器集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动规划工具在高风险应用中缺乏可预测性和重复性，SRMP旨在填补这一空白。

Result: SRMP满足工业和安全性要求，并在多样机器人系统中表现一致。

Conclusion: SRMP为运动规划设立了新标准，适用于复杂机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Motion planning is a critical component in any robotic system. Over the
years, powerful tools like the Open Motion Planning Library (OMPL) have been
developed, offering numerous motion planning algorithms. However, existing
frameworks often struggle to deliver the level of predictability and
repeatability demanded by high-stakes applications -- ranging from ensuring
safety in industrial environments to the creation of high-quality motion
datasets for robot learning. Complementing existing tools, we introduce SRMP
(Search-based Robot Motion Planning), a new software framework tailored for
robotic manipulation. SRMP distinguishes itself by generating consistent and
reliable trajectories, and is the first software tool to offer motion planning
algorithms for multi-robot manipulation tasks. SRMP easily integrates with
major simulators, including MuJoCo, Sapien, Genesis, and PyBullet via a Python
and C++ API. SRMP includes a dedicated MoveIt! plugin that enables immediate
deployment on robot hardware and seamless integration with existing pipelines.
Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate in this paper that SRMP not only
meets the rigorous demands of industrial and safety-critical applications but
also sets a new standard for consistency in motion planning across diverse
robotic systems. Visit srmp.readthedocs.io for SRMP documentation and

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视频的阶段感知奖励建模框架，用于长时程、接触丰富的机器人操作任务，显著提升了模仿学习的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模机器人学习中长时程、接触丰富的操作任务（如可变形物体处理）中演示质量不一致的问题。

Method: 引入阶段感知的视频奖励建模框架，结合高级任务阶段和细粒度进度预测，自动从自然语言子任务注释中生成奖励标签。

Result: 奖励模型在验证和真实机器人实验中优于基线，结合奖励对齐的行为克隆（RA-BC）方法，T恤折叠任务成功率显著提升。

Conclusion: 奖励建模是实现可扩展、高效注释和鲁棒模仿学习的关键，尤其在长时程操作任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Large-scale robot learning has recently shown promise for enabling robots to
perform complex tasks by integrating perception, control, and language
understanding. Yet, it struggles with long-horizon, contact-rich manipulation
such as deformable object handling, where demonstration quality is
inconsistent. Reward modeling offers a natural solution: by providing grounded
progress signals, it transforms noisy demonstrations into stable supervision
that generalizes across diverse trajectories. We introduce a stage-aware,
video-based reward modeling framework that jointly predicts high-level task
stages and fine-grained progress. Reward labels are automatically derived from
natural language subtask annotations, ensuring consistent progress estimation
across variable-length demonstrations. This design overcomes frame-index
labeling, which fails in variable-duration tasks like folding a T-shirt. Our
reward model demonstrates robustness to variability, generalization to
out-of-distribution settings, and strong utility for policy training. Building
on it, we propose Reward-Aligned Behavior Cloning (RA-BC), which filters
high-quality data and reweights samples by reward. Experiments show the reward
model alone outperforms baselines on validation and real robot rollouts.
Integrated into RA-BC, our approach achieves 83\% success on folding T-shirts
from the flattened state and 67\% from the crumpled state -- far surpassing
vanilla behavior cloning, which attains only 8\% and 0\% success. Overall, our
results highlight reward modeling as a key enabler for scalable,
annotation-efficient, and robust imitation learning in long-horizon
manipulation.

TL;DR: 提出了PACHs，一种基于并行最佳优先搜索的Actor-Critic推理算法，利用Actor和Critic网络提升搜索效率，并在机器人任务中验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Actor-Critic模型的部署策略较为简单，通常直接使用Actor策略，而忽略了Critic网络的潜力。

Method: 提出PACHs算法，通过并行化生成动作和成本估计，并利用多线程扩展搜索图。

Result: 在机器人操作任务（如无碰撞运动规划和接触丰富的非抓取推动）中表现出色。

Conclusion: PACHs通过结合Actor和Critic网络的并行搜索，显著提升了推理效率和任务性能。

Abstract: Actor-Critic models are a class of model-free deep reinforcement learning
(RL) algorithms that have demonstrated effectiveness across various robot
learning tasks. While considerable research has focused on improving training
stability and data sampling efficiency, most deployment strategies have
remained relatively simplistic, typically relying on direct actor policy
rollouts. In contrast, we propose \pachs{} (\textit{P}arallel
\textit{A}ctor-\textit{C}ritic \textit{H}euristic \textit{S}earch), an
efficient parallel best-first search algorithm for inference that leverages
both components of the actor-critic architecture: the actor network generates
actions, while the critic network provides cost-to-go estimates to guide the
search. Two levels of parallelism are employed within the search -- actions and
cost-to-go estimates are generated in batches by the actor and critic networks
respectively, and graph expansion is distributed across multiple threads. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in robotic manipulation tasks,
including collision-free motion planning and contact-rich interactions such as
non-prehensile pushing. Visit p-achs.github.io for demonstrations and examples.

Conclusion: CoTaP通过合规调制和强化学习，提升了人形机器人在交互中的稳定性和适应性。

Abstract: Humanoid whole-body locomotion control is a critical approach for humanoid
robots to leverage their inherent advantages. Learning-based control methods
derived from retargeted human motion data provide an effective means of
addressing this issue. However, because most current human datasets lack
measured force data, and learning-based robot control is largely
position-based, achieving appropriate compliance during interaction with real
environments remains challenging. This paper presents Compliant Task Pipeline
(CoTaP): a pipeline that leverages compliance information in the learning-based
structure of humanoid robots. A two-stage dual-agent reinforcement learning
framework combined with model-based compliance control for humanoid robots is
proposed. In the training process, first a base policy with a position-based
controller is trained; then in the distillation, the upper-body policy is
combined with model-based compliance control, and the lower-body agent is
guided by the base policy. In the upper-body control, adjustable task-space
compliance can be specified and integrated with other controllers through
compliance modulation on the symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifold,
ensuring system stability. We validated the feasibility of the proposed
strategy in simulation, primarily comparing the responses to external
disturbances under different compliance settings.

Result: 通过校园特定数据微调，系统能够准确预测地图并支持持续更新，展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: 该系统为自动驾驶提供了实时、低成本的高精地图解决方案，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are essential for autonomous driving, providing
precise information such as road boundaries, lane dividers, and crosswalks to
enable safe and accurate navigation. However, traditional HD map generation is
labor-intensive, expensive, and difficult to maintain in dynamic environments.
To overcome these challenges, we present a real-world deployment of an online
mapping system on a campus golf cart platform equipped with dual front cameras
and a LiDAR sensor. Our work tackles three core challenges: (1) labeling a 3D
HD map for campus environment; (2) integrating and generalizing the SemVecMap
model onboard; and (3) incrementally generating and updating the predicted HD
map to capture environmental changes. By fine-tuning with campus-specific data,
our pipeline produces accurate map predictions and supports continual updates,
demonstrating its practical value in real-world autonomous driving scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人系统中任务分配的实时调度问题，考虑随机到达和切换延迟。

Method: 提出ESL策略，结合穷尽服务和最长空闲队列切换，并通过马尔可夫决策过程建模。

Result: ESL在多种场景下表现最优，降低队列长度和持有成本。

Conclusion: ESL因其简单性和鲁棒性，成为多机器人调度系统的实用默认策略。

Abstract: We study online task allocation for multi-robot, multi-queue systems with
stochastic arrivals and switching delays. Time is slotted; each location can
host at most one robot per slot; service consumes one slot; switching between
locations incurs a one-slot travel delay; and arrivals are independent
Bernoulli processes. We formulate a discounted-cost Markov decision process and
propose Exhaustive-Serve-Longest (ESL), a simple real-time policy that serves
exhaustively when the current location is nonempty and, when idle, switches to
a longest unoccupied nonempty location, and we prove the optimality of this
policy. As baselines, we tune a fixed-dwell cyclic policy via a discrete-time
delay expression and implement a first-come-first-serve policy. Across
server-to-location ratios and loads, ESL consistently yields lower discounted
holding cost and smaller mean queue lengths, with action-time fractions showing
more serving and restrained switching. Its simplicity and robustness make ESL a
practical default for real-time multi-robot scheduling systems.

Motivation: RGB视觉系统难以区分地形内部差异（如含水量），而近红外光谱能提供更多信息，但受环境光照影响较大。

Method: 开发了HYPER DRIVE系统架构，收集并配准多波长高光谱图像，提出反射校准方法以适应不同光照条件。

Result: 系统能够计算植被健康指数和土壤含水量，展示了实际应用价值。

Conclusion: HYPER DRIVE系统通过高光谱成像和反射校准，有效解决了地形内部差异识别问题，适用于移动机器人平台。

Abstract: Intra-class terrain differences such as water content directly influence a
vehicle's ability to traverse terrain, yet RGB vision systems may fail to
distinguish these properties. Evaluating a terrain's spectral content beyond
red-green-blue wavelengths to the near infrared spectrum provides useful
information for intra-class identification. However, accurate analysis of this
spectral information is highly dependent on ambient illumination. We
demonstrate a system architecture to collect and register multi-wavelength,
hyperspectral images from a mobile robot and describe an approach to
reflectance calibrate cameras under varying illumination conditions. To
showcase the practical applications of our system, HYPER DRIVE, we demonstrate
the ability to calculate vegetative health indices and soil moisture content
from a mobile robot platform.

Motivation: 研究旨在通过统一的扩散框架，解决视觉-语言-动作模型在跨模态推理和泛化能力上的挑战，并优化实际部署中的推理延迟问题。

Method: dVLA采用扩散目标联合优化感知、语言理解和动作，并引入前缀注意力掩码和KV缓存加速推理。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中达到96.4%的平均成功率，在真实机器人任务中表现优异，包括需要多步规划的复杂任务。

Conclusion: dVLA展示了统一扩散框架在高性能视觉-语言-动作机器人中的潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are emerging as a next-generation
paradigm for robotics. We introduce dVLA, a diffusion-based VLA that leverages
a multimodal chain-of-thought to unify visual perception, language reasoning,
and robotic control in a single system. dVLA jointly optimizes perception,
language understanding, and action under a single diffusion objective, enabling
stronger cross-modal reasoning and better generalization to novel instructions
and objects. For practical deployment, we mitigate inference latency by
incorporating two acceleration strategies, a prefix attention mask and KV
caching, yielding up to around times speedup at test-time inference. We
evaluate dVLA in both simulation and the real world: on the LIBERO benchmark,
it achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 96.4% average success rate,
consistently surpassing both discrete and continuous action policies; on a real
Franka robot, it succeeds across a diverse task suite, including a challenging
bin-picking task that requires multi-step planning, demonstrating robust
real-world performance. Together, these results underscore the promise of

*Amelie Minji Kim,Anqi Wu,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的分层扩散规划器，将任务和运动结构直接嵌入噪声模型中，提高了任务对齐性和轨迹平滑性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散规划器使用零均值、各向同性高斯噪声，无法有效利用任务和运动结构信息。

Method: 采用任务条件化结构化高斯噪声，通过高斯过程运动规划生成先验实例，分层处理先验实例化和轨迹去噪。

Result: 在Maze2D和KUKA块堆叠实验中，相比各向同性基线，成功率和轨迹平滑性显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式结构化噪声过程，将概率质量集中在可行、平滑且语义有意义的轨迹上，同时保持可操作性。

Abstract: We propose a novel hierarchical diffusion planner that embeds task and motion
structure directly in the noise model. Unlike standard diffusion-based planners
that use zero-mean, isotropic Gaussian noise, we employ a family of
task-conditioned structured Gaussians whose means and covariances are derived
from Gaussian Process Motion Planning (GPMP): sparse, task-centric key states
or their associated timings (or both) are treated as noisy observations to
produce a prior instance. We first generalize the standard diffusion process to
biased, non-isotropic corruption with closed-form forward and posterior
expressions. Building on this, our hierarchy separates prior instantiation from
trajectory denoising: the upper level instantiates a task-conditioned
structured Gaussian (mean and covariance), and the lower level denoises the
full trajectory under that fixed prior. Experiments on Maze2D goal-reaching and
KUKA block stacking show improved success rates, smoother trajectories, and
stronger task alignment compared to isotropic baselines. Ablation studies
indicate that explicitly structuring the corruption process offers benefits
beyond simply conditioning the neural network. Overall, our method concentrates
probability mass of prior near feasible, smooth, and semantically meaningful
trajectories while maintaining tractability. Our project page is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: OmniNav是一个统一的导航框架，支持多种导航任务，通过快速-慢速模块协作和通用数据集集成，显著提升了导航性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有导航模型在多样化的导航任务中表现不佳，缺乏统一解决方案，导致低成功率和有限泛化能力。

Method: OmniNav采用快速-慢速系统设计：快速模块生成短视距路径点，慢速模块进行长视距规划；并集成通用数据集进行多任务训练。

Result: OmniNav在多个导航基准测试中达到最先进性能，并在实际部署中验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: OmniNav为具身导航提供了实用解决方案，展示了高度可扩展和泛化的机器人智能路径。

Abstract: Embodied navigation presents a core challenge for intelligent robots,
requiring the comprehension of visual environments, natural language
instructions, and autonomous exploration. Existing models often fall short in
offering a unified solution across diverse navigation paradigms, resulting in
low success rates and limited generalization. We introduce OmniNav, a unified
framework addressing instruct-goal, object-goal, point-goal navigation, and
frontier-based exploration within a single architecture. Our approach features
a lightweight, low-latency policy that accurately predicts continuous-space
waypoints (coordinates and orientations). This policy surpasses action-chunk
methods in precision and supports real-world deployment at control frequencies
up to 5 Hz. Architecturally, OmniNav employs a fast-slow system design: a fast
module generates waypoints using short-horizon visual context and subtasks,
while a slow module performs deliberative planning with long-horizon
observations and candidate frontiers to select subsequent subgoals and
subtasks. This collaboration enhances path efficiency and maintains trajectory
coherence, particularly in exploration and memory-intensive scenarios.
Crucially, we identify that the primary bottleneck isn't merely navigation
policy learning, but a robust understanding of general instructions and
objects. To boost generalization, OmniNav integrates large-scale,
general-purpose training datasets, including those for image captioning and
visual recognition, into a joint multi-task regimen. This significantly
improves success rates and robustness. Extensive experiments confirm OmniNav's
state-of-the-art performance across various navigation benchmarks, with
real-world deployment further validating its efficacy. OmniNav provides
practical insights for embodied navigation, charting a scalable path towards
versatile, highly generalizable robotic intelligence.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动作分块的PPO方法，结合行为克隆，解决了VLA模型训练中的稀疏奖励和不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在VLA模型后训练中存在稀疏奖励和不稳定训练的挑战。

Method: 采用动作分块的PPO方法，结合动态更新的演示缓冲区和行为克隆损失。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中表现优异，成功率达0.93，平均步数为42.17。

Conclusion: 验证了强化学习在VLA后训练中的可行性，为下游应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising avenue for post-training
vision-language-action (VLA) models, but practical deployment is hindered by
sparse rewards and unstable training. This work mitigates these challenges by
introducing an action chunk based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with
behavior cloning using self-collected demonstrations. Aggregating consecutive
actions into chunks improves the temporal consistency of the policy and the
density of informative feedback. In addition, an auxiliary behavior cloning
loss is applied with a dynamically updated demonstration buffer that
continually collects high-quality task trials during training. The relative
weight between the action-chunked PPO objective and the self behavior clone
auxiliary loss is adapted online to stabilize the post-training process.
Experiments on the MetaWorld benchmark indicate improved performance over
supervised fine-tuning, achieving a high success rate (0.93) and few steps to
success (42.17). These results demonstrate the viability of RL for VLA
post-training and help lay the groundwork for downstream VLA applications.

### [148] [TacRefineNet: Tactile-Only Grasp Refinement Between Arbitrary In-Hand Object Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25746)
*Shuaijun Wang,Haoran Zhou,Diyun Xiang,Yangwei You*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: TacRefineNet是一个仅依赖触觉反馈的框架，用于精确调整已知物体的手内姿态，通过多指触觉感知实现毫米级抓取精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统灵巧抓取和VLA方法在长时任务中因姿态不准确导致的性能下降问题。

Method: 设计多分支策略网络，融合多指触觉输入和本体感知，通过模拟和真实数据训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据预训练加少量真实数据微调显著优于仅模拟训练，实现毫米级精度。

Conclusion: TacRefineNet是首个仅通过多指触觉感知实现任意手内姿态精确调整的方法。

Abstract: Despite progress in both traditional dexterous grasping pipelines and recent
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) approaches, the grasp execution stage remains
prone to pose inaccuracies, especially in long-horizon tasks, which undermines
overall performance. To address this "last-mile" challenge, we propose
TacRefineNet, a tactile-only framework that achieves fine in-hand pose
refinement of known objects in arbitrary target poses using multi-finger
fingertip sensing. Our method iteratively adjusts the end-effector pose based
on tactile feedback, aligning the object to the desired configuration. We
design a multi-branch policy network that fuses tactile inputs from multiple
fingers along with proprioception to predict precise control updates. To train
this policy, we combine large-scale simulated data from a physics-based tactile
model in MuJoCo with real-world data collected from a physical system.
Comparative experiments show that pretraining on simulated data and fine-tuning
with a small amount of real data significantly improves performance over
simulation-only training. Extensive real-world experiments validate the
effectiveness of the method, achieving millimeter-level grasp accuracy using
only tactile input. To our knowledge, this is the first method to enable
arbitrary in-hand pose refinement via multi-finger tactile sensing alone.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦框架，将感知与控制分离，通过仿真训练控制策略，仅在实际部署时调整感知，显著提升了从仿真到现实的迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端学习中感知与控制纠缠的问题，提升机器人操作的仿真到现实迁移效率。

Method: 在仿真中训练控制策略，利用特权状态掌握空间布局和操作动态；实际部署时仅调整感知，将真实观察映射到冻结的控制策略。

Conclusion: 解耦感知与控制能从根本上改善仿真到现实的迁移效果，提升数据效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: Sim-to-real transfer remains a fundamental challenge in robot manipulation
due to the entanglement of perception and control in end-to-end learning. We
present a decoupled framework that learns each component where it is most
reliable: control policies are trained in simulation with privileged state to
master spatial layouts and manipulation dynamics, while perception is adapted
only at deployment to bridge real observations to the frozen control policy.
Our key insight is that control strategies and action patterns are universal
across environments and can be learned in simulation through systematic
randomization, while perception is inherently domain-specific and must be
learned where visual observations are authentic. Unlike existing end-to-end
approaches that require extensive real-world data, our method achieves strong
performance with only 10-20 real demonstrations by reducing the complex
sim-to-real problem to a structured perception alignment task. We validate our
approach on tabletop manipulation tasks, demonstrating superior data efficiency
and out-of-distribution generalization compared to end-to-end baselines. The
learned policies successfully handle object positions and scales beyond the
training distribution, confirming that decoupling perception from control
fundamentally improves sim-to-real transfer.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种稳定训练流式策略的方法，通过重新参数化速度网络，解决了梯度消失和爆炸问题，并在连续控制和机器人操作任务中取得了最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多步动作采样过程中的梯度问题，训练流式策略在离线强化学习中非常不稳定。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了两种稳定架构（Flow-G和Flow-T），并开发了一种基于SAC的算法，通过噪声增强的rollout实现端到端训练。

Result: 在连续控制和机器人操作任务中取得了最佳性能，无需依赖策略蒸馏或替代目标。

Conclusion: 通过重新参数化速度网络，论文成功解决了流式策略训练中的梯度问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Training expressive flow-based policies with off-policy reinforcement
learning is notoriously unstable due to gradient pathologies in the multi-step
action sampling process. We trace this instability to a fundamental connection:
the flow rollout is algebraically equivalent to a residual recurrent
computation, making it susceptible to the same vanishing and exploding
gradients as RNNs. To address this, we reparameterize the velocity network
using principles from modern sequential models, introducing two stable
architectures: Flow-G, which incorporates a gated velocity, and Flow-T, which
utilizes a decoded velocity. We then develop a practical SAC-based algorithm,
enabled by a noise-augmented rollout, that facilitates direct end-to-end
training of these policies. Our approach supports both from-scratch and
offline-to-online learning and achieves state-of-the-art performance on
continuous control and robotic manipulation benchmarks, eliminating the need
for common workarounds like policy distillation or surrogate objectives.

TL;DR: DP--AG是一种新的模仿学习方法，通过概率潜在动态统一感知与动作，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模仿学习方法忽略了感知与动作之间的因果互惠性，而人类自然利用这种互惠性实现自适应行为。

Method: DP--AG通过变分推断将潜在观察编码为高斯后验，并利用动作引导的SDE进行演化，同时引入循环一致性对比损失促进双向学习。

Result: DP--AG在仿真基准和真实UR5操作任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DP--AG为连接生物适应性与人工策略学习提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing imitation learning methods decouple perception and action, which
overlooks the causal reciprocity between sensory representations and action
execution that humans naturally leverage for adaptive behaviors. To bridge this
gap, we introduce Action--Guided Diffusion Policy (DP--AG), a unified
representation learning that explicitly models a dynamic interplay between
perception and action through probabilistic latent dynamics. DP--AG encodes
latent observations into a Gaussian posterior via variational inference and
evolves them using an action-guided SDE, where the Vector-Jacobian Product
(VJP) of the diffusion policy's noise predictions serves as a structured
stochastic force driving latent updates. To promote bidirectional learning
between perception and action, we introduce a cycle--consistent contrastive
loss that organizes the gradient flow of the noise predictor into a coherent
perception--action loop, enforcing mutually consistent transitions in both
latent updates and action refinements. Theoretically, we derive a variational
lower bound for the action-guided SDE, and prove that the contrastive objective
enhances continuity in both latent and action trajectories. Empirically, DP--AG
significantly outperforms state--of--the--art methods across simulation
benchmarks and real-world UR5 manipulation tasks. As a result, our DP--AG
offers a promising step toward bridging biological adaptability and artificial
policy learning.

TL;DR: REVER框架通过训练RoboFarseer模型，结合密集奖励和验证机制，显著提升了机器人执行长时程语言指令任务的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人执行长时程语言指令任务时，缺乏大规模序列化数据和密集奖励的问题。

Method: 利用Universal Manipulation Interface框架捕获原子技能演示，并通过自动化标注引擎生成视觉-指令-计划三元组。训练RoboFarseer模型进行时空推理，并引入可验证奖励机制。

Result: RoboFarseer性能优于基线模型40%，在真实任务中提升成功率约60%。

Conclusion: REVER框架有效提升了机器人规划能力，并将开源数据集和模型。

Abstract: Enabling robots to execute long-horizon manipulation tasks from free-form
language instructions remains a fundamental challenge in embodied AI. While
vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as high-level planners, their
deployment in the real world is hindered by two gaps: (i) the scarcity of
large-scale, sequential manipulation data that couples natural language with
multi-step action plans, and (ii) the absence of dense, interpretable rewards
for fine-tuning VLMs on planning objectives. To address these issues, we
propose REVER, a framework that empowers VLMs to generate and validate
long-horizon manipulation plans from natural language instructions in
real-world scenarios. Under REVER we train and release RoboFarseer, a VLM
incentivized to emit chain-of-thought that perform temporal and spatial
reasoning, ensuring physically plausible and logically coherent plans. To
obtain training data, we leverage the Universal Manipulation Interface
framework to capture hardware-agnostic demonstrations of atomic skills. An
automated annotation engine converts each demonstration into
vision-instruction-plan triplet. We introduce a verifiable reward that scores
the generated plan by its ordered bipartite matching overlap with the
ground-truth skill sequence. At run time, the fine-tuned VLM functions both as
a planner and as a monitor, verifying step-wise completion. RoboFarseer matches
or exceeds the performance of proprietary models that are orders of magnitude
larger, while on open-ended planning it surpasses the best baseline by more
than 40%. In real-world, long-horizon tasks, the complete system boosts overall
success by roughly 60% compared with the same low-level controller without the
planner. We will open-source both the dataset and the trained model upon
publication.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经网络的状态估计方法，用于估计具有主动或被动柔性的机器人的状态，包括形状和运动模式，并在GOAT平台上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性机器人在农业、研究和环境行业中具有潜力，但由于缺乏刚性假设和形态变化，状态估计具有挑战性。

Method: 使用神经网络和状态历史数据，结合对不可靠传感器的直接干预机制，在柔性和形态变化相关的坐标系中训练。

Result: 预测形状误差在机器人尺寸的4.2%以内，速度和方向误差分别为6.3%、2.4%和1.5度，并在电机故障时提高了300%的移动范围。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了柔性机器人在复杂环境中的状态估计能力，适用于自主户外操作。

Abstract: Locomotion robots with active or passive compliance can show robustness to
uncertain scenarios, which can be promising for agricultural, research and
environmental industries. However, state estimation for these robots is
challenging due to the lack of rigid-body assumptions and kinematic changes
from morphing. We propose a method to estimate typical rigid-body states
alongside compliance-related states, such as soft robot shape in different
morphologies and locomotion modes. Our neural network-based state estimator
uses a history of states and a mechanism to directly influence unreliable
sensors. We test our framework on the GOAT platform, a robot capable of passive
compliance and active morphing for extreme outdoor terrain. The network is
trained on motion capture data in a novel compliance-centric frame that
accounts for morphing-related states. Our method predicts shape-related
measurements within 4.2% of the robot's size, velocities within 6.3% and 2.4%
of the top linear and angular speeds, respectively, and orientation within 1.5
degrees. We also demonstrate a 300% increase in travel range during a motor
malfunction when using our estimator for closed-loop autonomous outdoor
operation.

Motivation: 传统人机交互界面依赖面板或手持设备，无法无缝集成到机器人曲面，限制了交互的自然性和效率。

Method: 采用编织触觉皮肤，结合织物柔韧性和结构稳定性，通过导电线程实现多通道传感；定义了14种手势动作映射，并设计了轻量级卷积-Transformer模型进行实时手势识别。

Result: 手势识别准确率接近100%，在机器人任务中（如抓取和倾倒）比传统面板减少57%的任务完成时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为更自然、高效的具身人机交互提供了实用路径。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel human-robot interaction (HRI) framework that
enables intuitive gesture-driven control through a capacitance-based woven
tactile skin. Unlike conventional interfaces that rely on panels or handheld
devices, the woven tactile skin integrates seamlessly with curved robot
surfaces, enabling embodied interaction and narrowing the gap between human
intent and robot response. Its woven design combines fabric-like flexibility
with structural stability and dense multi-channel sensing through the
interlaced conductive threads. Building on this capability, we define a
gesture-action mapping of 14 single- and multi-touch gestures that cover
representative robot commands, including task-space motion and auxiliary
functions. A lightweight convolution-transformer model designed for gesture
recognition in real time achieves an accuracy of near-100%, outperforming prior
baseline approaches. Experiments on robot arm tasks, including pick-and-place
and pouring, demonstrate that our system reduces task completion time by up to
57% compared with keyboard panels and teach pendants. Overall, our proposed
framework demonstrates a practical pathway toward more natural and efficient
embodied HRI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决物体导航任务中历史信息整合和动作序列预测的挑战，MUVLA通过语义地图和奖励信号来提升模型的性能。

Method: MUVLA采用三阶段训练流程：学习地图级空间理解、模仿混合质量演示的行为、奖励放大。

Result: 在HM3D和Gibson基准测试中，MUVLA表现出优秀的泛化能力，并能从低质量或部分成功的轨迹中学习有效的探索行为。

Conclusion: MUVLA通过语义地图和奖励引导的回报建模，显著提升了物体导航任务的性能，尤其在处理低质量数据时表现突出。

Abstract: In this paper, we present MUVLA, a Map Understanding Vision-Language-Action
model tailored for object navigation. It leverages semantic map abstractions to
unify and structure historical information, encoding spatial context in a
compact and consistent form. MUVLA takes the current and history observations,
as well as the semantic map, as inputs and predicts the action sequence based
on the description of goal object. Furthermore, it amplifies supervision
through reward-guided return modeling based on dense short-horizon progress
signals, enabling the model to develop a detailed understanding of action value
for reward maximization. MUVLA employs a three-stage training pipeline:
learning map-level spatial understanding, imitating behaviors from
mixed-quality demonstrations, and reward amplification. This strategy allows
MUVLA to unify diverse demonstrations into a robust spatial representation and
generate more rational exploration strategies. Experiments on HM3D and Gibson
benchmarks demonstrate that MUVLA achieves great generalization and learns
effective exploration behaviors even from low-quality or partially successful
trajectories.

Motivation: 毫米波雷达在恶劣条件下具有成本效益和可靠性，但点云稀疏性、多路径效应和角度分辨率限制影响了状态估计性能。

Method: S$^3$E利用雷达信号频谱绕过稀疏点，融合惯性数据，并通过跨融合技术增强空间结构信息。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需地面真值监督即可实现鲁棒且准确的定位。

Conclusion: S$^3$E首次以自监督方式融合雷达频谱和惯性数据，实现了互补的状态估计。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar for state estimation is gaining significant attention
for its affordability and reliability in harsh conditions. Existing
localization solutions typically rely on post-processed radar point clouds as
landmark points. Nonetheless, the inherent sparsity of radar point clouds,
ghost points from multi-path effects, and limited angle resolution in
single-chirp radar severely degrade state estimation performance. To address
these issues, we propose S$^3$E, a \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{S}upervised
\textbf{S}tate \textbf{E}stimator that employs more richly informative radar
signal spectra to bypass sparse points and fuses complementary inertial
information to achieve accurate localization. S$^3$E fully explores the
association between \textit{exteroceptive} radar and \textit{proprioceptive}
inertial sensor to achieve complementary benefits. To deal with limited angle
resolution, we introduce a novel cross-fusion technique that enhances spatial
structure information by exploiting subtle rotational shift correlations across
heterogeneous data. The experimental results demonstrate our method achieves
robust and accurate performance without relying on localization ground truth
supervision. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to achieve
state estimation by fusing radar spectra and inertial data in a complementary
self-supervised manner.

Motivation: 探索机器人情感表达如何影响儿童的同理心反应，为未来儿童与机器人互动提供参考。

Method: 通过22名7-11岁儿童参与的实验，测试机器人不同情感表达方式（仅身体、仅面部、身体和面部）对儿童行为的影响。

Result: 儿童行为会与机器人情绪状态对齐，但更高表达水平未显著增加对齐效果。

Conclusion: 初步结果为未来研究机器人情感表达对儿童社交行为的影响奠定了基础。

Abstract: The growing development of robots with artificial emotional expressiveness
raises important questions about their persuasive potential in children's
behavior. While research highlights the pragmatic value of emotional
expressiveness in human social communication, the extent to which robotic
expressiveness can or should influence empathic responses in children is
grounds for debate. In a pilot study with 22 children (aged 7-11) we begin to
explore the ways in which different levels of embodied expressiveness (body
only, face only, body and face) of two basic emotions (happiness and sadness)
displayed by an anthropomorphic robot (QTRobot) might modify children's
behavior in a child-robot cooperative turn-taking game. We observed that
children aligned their behavior to the robot's inferred emotional state.
However, higher levels of expressiveness did not result in increased alignment.
The preliminary results reported here provide a starting point for reflecting
on robotic expressiveness and its role in shaping children's social-emotional
behavior toward robots as social peers in the near future.

Method: 提出平面Signorini条件，一种锥互补性公式，用于建模刚体间的平面接触，并证明其与点接触Signorini定律的等价性。

Conclusion: 该工作为平面接触提供了数学一致且计算可行的基础，对接触动力学模拟和控制优化算法设计有重要意义。

Abstract: We present a unifying theoretical result that connects two foundational
principles in robotics: the Signorini law for point contacts, which underpins
many simulation methods for preventing object interpenetration, and the center
of pressure (also known as the zero-moment point), a key concept used in, for
instance, optimization-based locomotion control. Our contribution is the planar
Signorini condition, a conic complementarity formulation that models general
planar contacts between rigid bodies. We prove that this formulation is
equivalent to enforcing the punctual Signorini law across an entire contact
surface, thereby bridging the gap between discrete and continuous contact
models. A geometric interpretation reveals that the framework naturally
captures three physical regimes -sticking, separating, and tilting-within a
unified complementarity structure. This leads to a principled extension of the
classical center of pressure, which we refer to as the extended center of
pressure. By establishing this connection, our work provides a mathematically
consistent and computationally tractable foundation for handling planar
contacts, with implications for both the accurate simulation of contact
dynamics and the design of advanced control and optimization algorithms in
locomotion and manipulation.

under-explored. Movable obstacles lead to new fundamental challenges as the
state space, which includes both agents and movable obstacles, grows
exponentially with respect to the number of agents and movable obstacles. In
particular, movable obstacles often closely couple agents together spatially
and temporally. This paper makes a first attempt to adapt and fuse the popular
Conflict-Based Search (CBS) and Prioritized Planning (PP) for MAPF, and a
recent single-agent PAMO planner called PAMO*, together to address M-PAMO. We
compare their performance with up to 20 agents and hundreds of movable
obstacles, and show the pros and cons of these approaches.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人设计与控制分离的方法限制了硬件潜力的发挥，需要并行优化的协同设计方法。

Method: EA-CoRL通过设计进化和策略持续适应两个组件，结合进化算法和强化学习，优化硬件配置和控制策略。

Result: 在动态引体向上任务中，EA-CoRL比现有方法表现更好，探索了更广的设计空间。

Conclusion: 持续策略适应在机器人协同设计中至关重要，EA-CoRL为未来研究提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Humanoid robots have seen significant advancements in both design and
control, with a growing emphasis on integrating these aspects to enhance
overall performance. Traditionally, robot design has followed a sequential
process, where control algorithms are developed after the hardware is
finalized. However, this can be myopic and prevent robots to fully exploit
their hardware capabilities. Recent approaches advocate for co-design,
optimizing both design and control in parallel to maximize robotic
capabilities. This paper presents the Evolutionary Continuous Adaptive RL-based
Co-Design (EA-CoRL) framework, which combines reinforcement learning (RL) with
evolutionary strategies to enable continuous adaptation of the control policy
to the hardware. EA-CoRL comprises two key components: Design Evolution, which
explores the hardware choices using an evolutionary algorithm to identify
efficient configurations, and Policy Continuous Adaptation, which fine-tunes a
task-specific control policy across evolving designs to maximize performance
rewards. We evaluate EA-CoRL by co-designing the actuators (gear ratios) and
control policy of the RH5 humanoid for a highly dynamic chin-up task,
previously unfeasible due to actuator limitations. Comparative results against
state-of-the-art RL-based co-design methods show that EA-CoRL achieves higher
fitness score and broader design space exploration, highlighting the critical
role of continuous policy adaptation in robot co-design.

Abstract: This research presents a multi-robot system for inpatient care, designed
using swarm intelligence principles and incorporating wearable health sensors,
RF-based communication, and AI-driven decision support. Within a simulated
hospital environment, the system adopts a leader-follower swarm configuration
to perform patient monitoring, medicine delivery, and emergency assistance. Due
to ethical constraints, live patient trials were not conducted; instead,
validation was carried out through controlled self-testing with wearable
sensors. The Leader Robot acquires key physiological parameters, including
temperature, SpO2, heart rate, and fall detection, and coordinates other robots
when required. The Assistant Robot patrols corridors for medicine delivery,
while a robotic arm provides direct drug administration. The swarm-inspired
leader-follower strategy enhanced communication reliability and ensured
continuous monitoring, including automated email alerts to healthcare staff.
The system hardware was implemented using Arduino, Raspberry Pi, NRF24L01 RF
modules, and a HuskyLens AI camera. Experimental evaluation showed an overall
sensor accuracy above 94%, a 92% task-level success rate, and a 96%
communication reliability rate, demonstrating system robustness. Furthermore,
the AI-enabled decision support was able to provide early warnings of abnormal
health conditions, highlighting the potential of the system as a cost-effective
solution for hospital automation and patient safety.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了AUV在海藻养殖场中的导航问题，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: The transition of seaweed farming to an alternative food source on an
industrial scale relies on automating its processes through smart farming,
equivalent to land agriculture. Key to this process are autonomous underwater
vehicles (AUVs) via their capacity to automate crop and structural inspections.
However, the current bottleneck for their deployment is ensuring safe
navigation within farms, which requires an accurate, online estimate of the AUV
pose and map of the infrastructure. To enable this, we propose an efficient
side scan sonar-based (SSS) simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
framework that exploits the geometry of kelp farms via modeling structural
ropes in the back-end as sequences of individual landmarks from each SSS ping
detection, instead of combining detections into elongated representations. Our
method outperforms state of the art solutions in hardware in the loop (HIL)
experiments on a real AUV survey in a kelp farm. The framework and dataset can

Motivation: 现有方法由于忽略地形几何信息，容易导致姿态漂移，尤其是在非结构化地形（如颠簸道路和楼梯）中。

Conclusion: 提出的地形感知LiDAR-惯性里程计框架有效减少了z轴姿态漂移，提升了非结构化地形中的定位精度。

Abstract: An accurate odometry is essential for legged-wheel robots operating in
unstructured terrains such as bumpy roads and staircases. Existing methods
often suffer from pose drift due to their ignorance of terrain geometry. We
propose a terrain-awared LiDAR-Inertial odometry (LIO) framework that
approximates the terrain using Radial Basis Functions (RBF) whose centers are
adaptively selected and weights are recursively updated. The resulting smooth
terrain manifold enables ``soft constraints" that regularize the odometry
optimization and mitigates the $z$-axis pose drift under abrupt elevation
changes during robot's maneuver. To ensure the LIO's real-time performance, we
further evaluate the RBF-related terms and calculate the inverse of the sparse
kernel matrix with GPU parallelization. Experiments on unstructured terrains
demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy than the
state-of-the-art baselines, especially in the scenarios that have continuous
height changes or sparse features when abrupt height changes occur.

Abstract: The rapid increase in the development of humanoid robots and customized
manufacturing solutions has brought dexterous manipulation to the forefront of
modern robotics. Over the past decade, several expensive dexterous hands have
come to market, but advances in hardware design, particularly in servo motors
and 3D printing, have recently facilitated an explosion of cheaper open-source
hands. Most hands are anthropomorphic to allow use of standard human tools, and
attempts to increase dexterity often sacrifice anthropomorphism. We introduce
the open-source ISyHand (pronounced easy-hand), a highly dexterous, low-cost,
easy-to-manufacture, on-joint servo-driven robot hand. Our hand uses
off-the-shelf Dynamixel motors, fasteners, and 3D-printed parts, can be
assembled within four hours, and has a total material cost of about 1,300 USD.
The ISyHands's unique articulated-palm design increases overall dexterity with
only a modest sacrifice in anthropomorphism. To demonstrate the utility of the
articulated palm, we use reinforcement learning in simulation to train the hand
to perform a classical in-hand manipulation task: cube reorientation. Our
novel, systematic experiments show that the simulated ISyHand outperforms the
two most comparable hands in early training phases, that all three perform
similarly well after policy convergence, and that the ISyHand significantly
outperforms a fixed-palm version of its own design. Additionally, we deploy a
policy trained on cube reorientation on the real hand, demonstrating its
ability to perform real-world dexterous manipulation.

Result: 在布线和拧螺丝任务中，AUROC超过0.93，能可靠检测严重故障；打磨任务中仅能检测严重故障。

Conclusion: 异常检测方法在复杂任务中表现良好，但需改进以检测更细微的故障。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution states in robot manipulation often lead to unpredictable
robot behavior or task failure, limiting success rates and increasing risk of
damage. Anomaly detection (AD) can identify deviations from expected patterns
in data, which can be used to trigger failsafe behaviors and recovery
strategies. Prior work has applied data-driven AD to time series data in
specific robotic tasks, but its transferability across control strategies and
task types has not been shown. Leveraging time series data, such as
force/torque signals, allows to directly capture robot-environment
interactions, crucial for manipulation and online failure detection. Their
broad availability, high sampling rates, and low dimensionality enable high
temporal resolution and efficient processing. As robotic tasks can have widely
signal characteristics and requirements, AD methods which can be applied in the
same way to a wide range of tasks is needed, ideally with good data efficiency.
We examine three industrial robotic tasks, each presenting several anomalies.
Test scenarios in robotic cabling, screwing, and sanding are built, and
multimodal time series data is gathered. Several autoencoder-based methods are
compared, evaluating generalization across tasks and control methods (diffusion
policy, position, and impedance control). This allows us to validate the
integration of AD in complex tasks involving tighter tolerances and variation
from both the robot and its environment. Additionally, we evaluate data
efficiency, detection latency, and task characteristics which support robust
detection. The results indicate reliable detection with AUROC exceeding 0.93 in
failures in the cabling and screwing task, such as incorrect or misaligned
parts and obstructed targets. In the polishing task, only severe failures were
reliably detected, while more subtle failure types remained undetected.

Conclusion: LLM-MCoX提供自然语言搜索能力，优于传统算法。

Abstract: Autonomous exploration and object search in unknown indoor environments
remain challenging for multi-robot systems (MRS). Traditional approaches often
rely on greedy frontier assignment strategies with limited inter-robot
coordination. In this work, we introduce LLM-MCoX (LLM-based Multi-robot
Coordinated Exploration and Search), a novel framework that leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) for intelligent coordination of both homogeneous and
heterogeneous robot teams tasked with efficient exploration and target object
search. Our approach combines real-time LiDAR scan processing for frontier
cluster extraction and doorway detection with multimodal LLM reasoning (e.g.,
GPT-4o) to generate coordinated waypoint assignments based on shared
environment maps and robot states. LLM-MCoX demonstrates superior performance
compared to existing methods, including greedy and Voronoi-based planners,
achieving 22.7% faster exploration times and 50% improved search efficiency in
large environments with 6 robots. Notably, LLM-MCoX enables natural
language-based object search capabilities, allowing human operators to provide
high-level semantic guidance that traditional algorithms cannot interpret.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动机器人在未知环境中依赖传感器数据建模，但噪声和算法缺陷导致障碍物识别不一致，影响运动规划的安全性。

Method: 论文提出了三种迭代方法（PEH、GEH、GEGRH），其中GEGRH通过延迟子搜索和基于分歧节点修订图，优化了路径规划和计算效率。

Result: 实验表明，GEGRH在非结构化环境中比VEH生成更低成本的轨迹，且规划时间更快；相比SH，GEGRH生成更保守的路径，但规划时间略有增加。

Conclusion: GEGRH是一种有效的多假设搜索方法，适用于动态环境中的机器人路径规划，平衡了安全性和计算效率。

Abstract: Mobile ground robots lacking prior knowledge of an environment must rely on
sensor data to develop a model of their surroundings. In these scenarios,
consistent identification of obstacles and terrain features can be difficult
due to noise and algorithmic shortcomings, which can make it difficult for
motion planning systems to generate safe motions. One particular difficulty to
overcome is when regions of the cost map switch between being marked as
obstacles and free space through successive planning cycles. One potential
solution to this, which we refer to as Valid in Every Hypothesis (VEH), is for
the planning system to plan motions that are guaranteed to be safe through a
history of world models. Another approach is to track a history of world
models, and adjust node costs according to the potential penalty of needing to
reroute around previously hazardous areas. This work discusses three major
iterations on this idea. The first iteration, called PEH, invokes a sub-search
for every node expansion that crosses through a divergence point in the world
models. The second and third iterations, called GEH and GEGRH respectively,
defer the sub-search until after an edge expands into the goal region. GEGRH
uses an additional step to revise the graph based on divergent nodes in each
world. Initial results showed that, although PEH and GEH find more optimistic
solutions than VEH, they are unable to generate solutions in less than
one-second, which exceeds our requirements for field deployment. Analysis of
results from a field experiment in an unstructured, off-road environment on a
Clearpath Robotics Warthog UGV indicate that GEGRH finds lower cost
trajectories and has faster average planning times than VEH. Compared to
single-hypothesis (SH) search, where only the latest world model is considered,
GEGRH generates more conservative plans with a small increase in average
planning time.

Result: 实验表明SDA-PLANNER在成功率和目标完成率上优于基线，尤其在多样错误条件下。

Conclusion: SDA-PLANNER通过动态修订和错误处理机制，显著提升了任务规划的综合性能。

Abstract: Embodied task planning requires agents to produce executable actions in a
close-loop manner within the environment. With progressively improving
capabilities of LLMs in task decomposition, planning, and generalization,
current embodied task planning methods adopt LLM-based architecture.However,
existing LLM-based planners remain limited in three aspects, i.e., fixed
planning paradigms, lack of action sequence constraints, and error-agnostic. In
this work, we propose SDA-PLANNER, enabling an adaptive planning paradigm,
state-dependency aware and error-aware mechanisms for comprehensive embodied
task planning. Specifically, SDA-PLANNER introduces a State-Dependency Graph to
explicitly model action preconditions and effects, guiding the dynamic
revision. To handle execution error, it employs an error-adaptive replanning
strategy consisting of Error Backtrack and Diagnosis and Adaptive Action
SubTree Generation, which locally reconstructs the affected portion of the plan
based on the current environment state. Experiments demonstrate that
SDA-PLANNER consistently outperforms baselines in success rate and goal
completion, particularly under diverse error conditions.

Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths,
subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot
trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However,
the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high
computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational
efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward
algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which
achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and
backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path
segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five
racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex
acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times
closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being
up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with
coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory
planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at:

Result: 解耦旋转方法更舒适且用户偏好，能显著减少VR晕动症，且对任务表现无显著影响。

Conclusion: 解耦机器人旋转是提升沉浸式远程临场体验的有效方法，尤其在真实环境中。

Abstract: Immersive telepresence, when a user views the video stream of a $360^\circ$
camera in a remote environment using a Head Mounted Display (HMD), has great
potential to improve the sense of being in a remote environment. In most cases
of immersive robotic telepresence, the camera is mounted on a mobile robot
which increases the portion of the environment that the remote user can
explore. However, robot motions can induce unpleasant symptoms associated with
Virtual Reality (VR) sickness, degrading the overall user experience. Previous
research has shown that unwinding the rotations of the robot, that is,
decoupling the rotations that the camera undergoes due to robot motions from
what is seen by the user, can increase user comfort and reduce VR sickness.
However, that work considered a virtual environment and a simulated robot. In
this work, to test whether the same hypotheses hold when the video stream from
a real camera is used, we carried out a user study $(n=36)$ in which the
unwinding rotations method was compared against coupled rotations in a task
completed through a panoramic camera mounted on a robotic arm. Furthermore,
within an inspection task which involved translations and rotations in three
dimensions, we tested whether unwinding the robot rotations impacted the
performance of users. The results show that the users found the unwinding
rotations method to be more comfortable and preferable, and that a reduced
level of VR sickness can be achieved without a significant impact on task
performance.

Abstract: Optimization-based methods are widely used for computing fast, diverse
solutions for complex tasks such as collision-free movement or planning in the
presence of contacts. However, most of these methods require enforcing
non-penetration constraints between objects, resulting in a non-trivial and
computationally expensive problem. This makes the use of optimization-based
methods for planning and control challenging. In this paper, we present a
method to efficiently enforce non-penetration of sets while performing
optimization over their configuration, which is directly applicable to problems
like collision-aware trajectory optimization. We introduce novel differentiable
conditions with analytic expressions to achieve this. To enforce non-collision
between non-smooth bodies using these conditions, we introduce a method to
approximate polytopes as smooth semi-algebraic sets. We present several
numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method and
compare the performance with other baseline methods recently proposed in the
literature.

Conclusion: LfH-CP通过自监督方式高效生成多样化数据集，显著提升运动规划性能。

Abstract: Generating large and diverse obstacle datasets to learn motion planning in
environments with dynamic obstacles is challenging due to the vast space of
possible obstacle trajecto- ries. Inspired by hallucination-based data
synthesis approaches, we propose Learning from Hallucinating Critical Points
(LfH- CP), a self-supervised framework for creating rich dynamic ob- stacle
datasets based on existing optimal motion plans without requiring expensive
expert demonstrations or trial-and-error exploration. LfH-CP factorizes
hallucination into two stages: first identifying when and where obstacles must
appear in order to result in an optimal motion plan, i.e., the critical points,
and then procedurally generating diverse trajectories that pass through these
points while avoiding collisions. This factorization avoids generative failures
such as mode collapse and ensures coverage of diverse dynamic behaviors. We
further introduce a diversity metric to quantify dataset richness and show that
LfH-CP produces substantially more varied training data than existing
baselines. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that planners trained on
LfH-CP datasets achieves higher success rates compared to a prior hallucination
method.

Abstract: Mean-shift-based approaches have recently emerged as the most effective
methods for robot swarm shape assembly tasks. These methods rely on image-based
representations of target shapes to compute local density gradients and perform
mean-shift exploration, which constitute their core mechanism. However, such
image representations incur substantial memory overhead, which can become
prohibitive for high-resolution or 3D shapes. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a memory-efficient tree map representation that hierarchically encodes
user-specified shapes and is applicable to both 2D and 3D scenarios. Building
on this representation, we design a behavior-based distributed controller that
enables assignment-free shape assembly. Comparative 2D and 3D simulations
against a state-of-the-art mean-shift algorithm demonstrate one to two orders
of magnitude lower memory usage and two to three times faster shape entry while
maintaining comparable uniformity. Finally, we validate the framework through
physical experiments with 6 to 7 UAVs, confirming its real-world practicality.

Abstract: Radio-based methods such as Ultra-Wideband (UWB) and RAdio Detection And
Ranging (radar), which have traditionally seen limited adoption in robotics,
are experiencing a boost in popularity thanks to their robustness to harsh
environmental conditions and cluttered environments. This work proposes a
multi-robot UGV-UAV localization system that leverages the two technologies
with inexpensive and readily-available sensors, such as Inertial Measurement
Units (IMUs) and wheel encoders, to estimate the relative position of an aerial
robot with respect to a ground robot. The first stage of the system pipeline
includes a nonlinear optimization framework to trilaterate the location of the
aerial platform based on UWB range data, and a radar pre-processing module with
loosely coupled ego-motion estimation which has been adapted for a multi-robot
scenario. Then, the pre-processed radar data as well as the relative
transformation are fed to a pose-graph optimization framework with odometry and
inter-robot constraints. The system, implemented for the Robotic Operating
System (ROS 2) with the Ceres optimizer, has been validated in
Software-in-the-Loop (SITL) simulations and in a real-world dataset. The
proposed relative localization module outperforms state-of-the-art closed-form
methods which are less robust to noise. Our SITL environment includes a custom
Gazebo plugin for generating realistic UWB measurements modeled after real
data. Conveniently, the proposed factor graph formulation makes the system
readily extensible to full Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM).
Finally, all the code and experimental data is publicly available to support
reproducibility and to serve as a common open dataset for benchmarking.

Abstract: We present Graphite, a GPU-accelerated nonlinear graph optimization
framework. It provides a CUDA C++ interface to enable the sharing of code
between a realtime application, such as a SLAM system, and its optimization
tasks. The framework supports techniques to reduce memory usage, including
in-place optimization, support for multiple floating point types and
mixed-precision modes, and dynamically computed Jacobians. We evaluate Graphite
on well-known bundle adjustment problems and find that it achieves similar
performance to MegBA, a solver specialized for bundle adjustment, while
maintaining generality and using less memory. We also apply Graphite to global
visual-inertial bundle adjustment on maps generated from stereo-inertial SLAM
datasets, and observe speed ups of up to 59x compared to a CPU baseline. Our
results indicate that our solver enables faster large-scale optimization on
both desktop and resource-constrained devices.

TL;DR: OmniRetarget是一种基于交互网格的数据生成引擎，解决了人机交互中的运动重定向问题，生成高质量的运动轨迹，支持强化学习策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有运动重定向方法在人体与机器人之间的显著差异下表现不佳，且忽略了关键的人-物和环境交互。

Method: 通过最小化Laplacian变形并保持交互关系，生成运动轨迹，支持数据增强。

Result: 生成8小时高质量轨迹，优于基线方法，支持长时程任务执行。

Conclusion: OmniRetarget能高效生成高质量数据，支持复杂任务的强化学习训练。

Abstract: A dominant paradigm for teaching humanoid robots complex skills is to
retarget human motions as kinematic references to train reinforcement learning
(RL) policies. However, existing retargeting pipelines often struggle with the
significant embodiment gap between humans and robots, producing physically
implausible artifacts like foot-skating and penetration. More importantly,
common retargeting methods neglect the rich human-object and human-environment
interactions essential for expressive locomotion and loco-manipulation. To
address this, we introduce OmniRetarget, an interaction-preserving data
generation engine based on an interaction mesh that explicitly models and
preserves the crucial spatial and contact relationships between an agent, the
terrain, and manipulated objects. By minimizing the Laplacian deformation
between the human and robot meshes while enforcing kinematic constraints,
OmniRetarget generates kinematically feasible trajectories. Moreover,
preserving task-relevant interactions enables efficient data augmentation, from
a single demonstration to different robot embodiments, terrains, and object
configurations. We comprehensively evaluate OmniRetarget by retargeting motions
from OMOMO, LAFAN1, and our in-house MoCap datasets, generating over 8-hour
trajectories that achieve better kinematic constraint satisfaction and contact
preservation than widely used baselines. Such high-quality data enables
proprioceptive RL policies to successfully execute long-horizon (up to 30
seconds) parkour and loco-manipulation skills on a Unitree G1 humanoid, trained
with only 5 reward terms and simple domain randomization shared by all tasks,
without any learning curriculum.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多感官语言-动作（MLA）模型，通过协作感知异构感官模态并预测未来多感官目标，提升机器人复杂控制任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型主要关注视觉和语言生成动作，但机器人需要在空间物理世界中感知和交互，因此需要更全面的多感官理解。

Method: 提出无编码器的多模态对齐方案，利用大语言模型直接解释多模态线索；设计未来多感官生成后训练策略，增强对物理动态的理解。

Result: MLA模型在复杂接触任务中优于现有2D和3D VLA方法12%和24%，并展示了对未见配置的更好泛化能力。

Conclusion: MLA模型通过多感官协作和未来预测，显著提升了机器人在物理世界中的交互能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown generalization capabilities
in robotic manipulation tasks by inheriting from vision-language models (VLMs)
and learning action generation. Most VLA models focus on interpreting vision
and language to generate actions, whereas robots must perceive and interact
within the spatial-physical world. This gap highlights the need for a
comprehensive understanding of robotic-specific multisensory information, which
is crucial for achieving complex and contact-rich control. To this end, we
introduce a multisensory language-action (MLA) model that collaboratively
perceives heterogeneous sensory modalities and predicts future multisensory
objectives to facilitate physical world modeling. Specifically, to enhance
perceptual representations, we propose an encoder-free multimodal alignment
scheme that innovatively repurposes the large language model itself as a
perception module, directly interpreting multimodal cues by aligning 2D images,
3D point clouds, and tactile tokens through positional correspondence. To
further enhance MLA's understanding of physical dynamics, we design a future
multisensory generation post-training strategy that enables MLA to reason about
semantic, geometric, and interaction information, providing more robust
conditions for action generation. For evaluation, the MLA model outperforms the
previous state-of-the-art 2D and 3D VLA methods by 12% and 24% in complex,
contact-rich real-world tasks, respectively, while also demonstrating improved
generalization to unseen configurations. Project website:

Conclusion: SOLD为药物设计提供了一种简单高效的生成方法，未来可通过更多数据进一步优化。

Abstract: Recently, machine learning has made a significant impact on de novo drug

propose SOLD (SELFIES-based Objective-driven Latent Diffusion), a novel latent
diffusion model that generates molecules in a latent space derived from 1D
SELFIES strings and conditioned on a target protein. In the process, we also
train an innovative SELFIES transformer and propose a new way to balance losses
when training multi-task machine learning models.Our model generates
high-affinity molecules for the target protein in a simple and efficient way,
while also leaving room for future improvements through the addition of more

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉和语言的多模态框架（VLHSA模块），通过语义对齐提升拼图性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅依赖视觉线索，忽略了语言描述的语义指导，尤其在复杂场景（如侵蚀间隙拼图）中表现不足。

Method: 提出VLHSA模块，通过多级语义匹配（从局部到全局）对齐视觉块与文本描述，并整合双视觉编码器和语言特征进行跨模态推理。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上显著优于现有模型，拼图准确率提升14.2个百分点。

Conclusion: 通过引入多模态语义理解，为拼图问题建立了新范式，验证了VLHSA模块的关键作用。

Abstract: Jigsaw puzzle solving remains challenging in computer vision, requiring an
understanding of both local fragment details and global spatial relationships.
While most traditional approaches only focus on visual cues like edge matching
and visual coherence, few methods explore natural language descriptions for
semantic guidance in challenging scenarios, especially for eroded gap puzzles.
We propose a vision-language framework that leverages textual context to
enhance puzzle assembly performance. Our approach centers on the
Vision-Language Hierarchical Semantic Alignment (VLHSA) module, which aligns
visual patches with textual descriptions through multi-level semantic matching
from local tokens to global context. Also, a multimodal architecture that
combines dual visual encoders with language features for cross-modal reasoning
is integrated into this module. Experiments demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models across various datasets,
achieving substantial improvements, including a 14.2 percentage point gain in
piece accuracy. Ablation studies confirm the critical role of the VLHSA module
in driving improvements over vision-only approaches. Our work establishes a new
paradigm for jigsaw puzzle solving by incorporating multimodal semantic
insights.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级推理优化方法Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS)，通过动态调整token分布提升LLM的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有熵最小化方法计算开销高且未能有效利用历史token上下文。

Method: SLS利用最近logits的谱和熵特性，通过滑动窗口和SVD动态调整logit分布。

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中，SLS优于现有方法，尤其在数学、编程和科学推理任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLS无需更新模型参数即可有效提升输出分布的准确性，同时保持上下文一致性。

Abstract: Entropy-based inference methods have gained traction for improving the
reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, many existing approaches,
such as entropy minimization techniques, suffer from high computational
overhead and fail to leverage historical token context effectively. To address
these limitations, we propose Spectral Logit Sculpting (SLS), a lightweight
inference-time optimization method that dynamically modulates token
distributions using spectral and entropic properties of recent logits. SLS
maintains a sliding buffer of top-K logits, performs on-the-fly Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to identify dominant spectral directions, and adaptively
rescales logits based on both entropy and logit gap statistics--only activating
when uncertainty is high. Without updating any model parameters, SLS
effectively sharpens the output distribution while preserving contextual
consistency. Experimental results on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate
that SLS consistently outperforms existing baseline methods, achieving superior
accuracy in mathematical, coding, and scientific reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法（如GRACE）因依赖非多项式操作，无法与同态加密等隐私保护技术兼容。

Method: 提出完全多项式友好的GCN编码器和基于多项式的对比损失函数。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer和PubMed数据集上，Poly-GRACE性能接近或优于非隐私基线。

Conclusion: Poly-GRACE是迈向高性能隐私保护图表示学习的重要一步。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations on graph data without requiring manual labels.
However, leading SSL methods like GRACE are fundamentally incompatible with
privacy-preserving technologies such as Homomorphic Encryption (HE) due to
their reliance on non-polynomial operations. This paper introduces Poly-GRACE,
a novel framework for HE-compatible self-supervised learning on graphs. Our
approach consists of a fully polynomial-friendly Graph Convolutional Network
(GCN) encoder and a novel, polynomial-based contrastive loss function. Through
experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Cora, CiteSeer, and PubMed -- we
demonstrate that Poly-GRACE not only enables private pre-training but also
achieves performance that is highly competitive with, and in the case of
CiteSeer, superior to the standard non-private baseline. Our work represents a
significant step towards practical and high-performance privacy-preserving
graph representation learning.

Motivation: 研究双曲流形上的优化方法，以提升在非欧几里得空间（如Poincaré球）中的学习效率，特别是在参数远离最优解的早期训练阶段。

Method: 扩展Riemannian SGD为双曲Adam优化器，结合双曲时间离散化的Langevin动力学，应用于扩散模型的训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在特定数据集上实现了更快的收敛速度，同时保持了生成质量。

Conclusion: 双曲优化方法在非欧几里得空间中具有潜力，能够加速训练收敛，尤其在早期阶段表现显著。

Abstract: This work explores optimization methods on hyperbolic manifolds. Building on
Riemannian optimization principles, we extend the Hyperbolic Stochastic
Gradient Descent (a specialization of Riemannian SGD) to a Hyperbolic Adam
optimizer. While these methods are particularly relevant for learning on the
Poincar\'e ball, they may also provide benefits in Euclidean and other
non-Euclidean settings, as the chosen optimization encourages the learning of
Poincar\'e embeddings. This representation, in turn, accelerates convergence in
the early stages of training, when parameters are far from the optimum. As a
case study, we train diffusion models using the hyperbolic optimization methods
with hyperbolic time-discretization of the Langevin dynamics, and show that
they achieve faster convergence on certain datasets without sacrificing
generative quality.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in
feature engineering for tabular data, but concerns about their reliability
persist, especially due to variability in generated outputs. We introduce a
multi-level diagnosis and evaluation framework to assess the robustness of LLMs
in feature engineering across diverse domains, focusing on the three main
factors: key variables, relationships, and decision boundary values for
predicting target classes. We demonstrate that the robustness of LLMs varies
significantly over different datasets, and that high-quality LLM-generated
features can improve few-shot prediction performance by up to 10.52%. This work
opens a new direction for assessing and enhancing the reliability of LLM-driven

Result: 暴雨事件预测的CSI从0.012提升至0.067，FSS超过0.45。

Conclusion: DPSformer为暴雨预测提供了有效的长尾学习范式，有助于提升预警系统和社会减灾。

Abstract: Accurate and timely forecasting of heavy rainfall remains a critical
challenge for modern society. Precipitation exhibits a highly imbalanced
distribution: most observations record no or light rain, while heavy rainfall
events are rare. Such an imbalanced distribution obstructs deep learning models
from effectively predicting heavy rainfall events. To address this challenge,
we treat rainfall forecasting explicitly as a long-tailed learning problem,
identifying the insufficient representation of heavy rainfall events as the
primary barrier to forecasting accuracy. Therefore, we introduce DPSformer, a
long-tail-aware model that enriches representation of heavy rainfall events
through a high-resolution branch. For heavy rainfall events $ \geq $ 50 mm/6 h,
DPSformer lifts the Critical Success Index (CSI) of a baseline Numerical
Weather Prediction (NWP) model from 0.012 to 0.067. For the top 1% coverage of
heavy rainfall events, its Fraction Skill Score (FSS) exceeds 0.45, surpassing
existing methods. Our work establishes an effective long-tailed paradigm for
heavy rainfall prediction, offering a practical tool to enhance early warning
systems and mitigate the societal impacts of extreme weather events.

Result: 实验表明STCast在四项任务中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STCast通过动态边界优化和时间模式捕捉，显著提升了区域天气预报性能。

Abstract: To gain finer regional forecasts, many works have explored the regional
integration from the global atmosphere, e.g., by solving boundary equations in
physics-based methods or cropping regions from global forecasts in data-driven
methods. However, the effectiveness of these methods is often constrained by
static and imprecise regional boundaries, resulting in poor generalization
ability. To address this issue, we propose Spatial-Temporal Weather Forecasting
(STCast), a novel AI-driven framework for adaptive regional boundary
optimization and dynamic monthly forecast allocation. Specifically, our
approach employs a Spatial-Aligned Attention (SAA) mechanism, which aligns
global and regional spatial distributions to initialize boundaries and
adaptively refines them based on attention-derived alignment patterns.
Furthermore, we design a Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (TMoE) module, where
atmospheric variables from distinct months are dynamically routed to
specialized experts using a discrete Gaussian distribution, enhancing the
model's ability to capture temporal patterns. Beyond global and regional
forecasting, we evaluate our STCast on extreme event prediction and ensemble
forecasting. Experimental results demonstrate consistent superiority over
state-of-the-art methods across all four tasks.

Motivation: 传统执行策略在灵活时间边界和多约束条件下表现不佳，LEMs旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用TKANs、VSNs和多头注意力机制处理市场数据，独立分配网络处理不同执行逻辑。

Result: 在加密货币和股票市场中，LEMs表现优于传统基准，能动态优化执行路径。

Conclusion: LEMs提供统一框架，适用于多种执行场景，具有显著操作优势。

Abstract: This paper introduces Large Execution Models (LEMs), a novel deep learning
framework that extends transformer-based architectures to address complex
execution problems with flexible time boundaries and multiple execution
constraints. Building upon recent advances in neural VWAP execution strategies,
LEMs generalize the approach from fixed-duration orders to scenarios where
execution duration is bounded between minimum and maximum time horizons,
similar to share buyback contract structures. The proposed architecture
decouples market information processing from execution allocation decisions: a
common feature extraction pipeline using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(TKANs), Variable Selection Networks (VSNs), and multi-head attention
mechanisms processes market data to create informational context, while
independent allocation networks handle the specific execution logic for
different scenarios (fixed quantity vs. fixed notional, buy vs. sell orders).
This architectural separation enables a unified model to handle diverse
execution objectives while leveraging shared market understanding across
scenarios. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation on intraday
cryptocurrency markets and multi-day equity trading using DOW Jones
constituents, we demonstrate that LEMs achieve superior execution performance
compared to traditional benchmarks by dynamically optimizing execution paths
within flexible time constraints. The unified model architecture enables
deployment across different execution scenarios (buy/sell orders, varying
duration boundaries, volume/notional targets) through a single framework,
providing significant operational advantages over asset-specific approaches.

Abstract: The optimization of hyperparameters in convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
remains a challenging and computationally expensive process, often requiring
extensive trial-and-error approaches or exhaustive grid searches. This study
introduces the application of Taguchi Design of Experiments methodology, a
statistical optimization technique traditionally used in quality engineering,
to systematically optimize CNN hyperparameters for professional boxing action
recognition. Using an L12(211) orthogonal array, eight hyperparameters
including image size, color mode, activation function, learning rate,
rescaling, shuffling, vertical flip, and horizontal flip were systematically
evaluated across twelve experimental configurations. To address the
multi-objective nature of machine learning optimization, five different
approaches were developed to simultaneously optimize training accuracy,
validation accuracy, training loss, and validation loss using Signal-to-Noise
ratio analysis. The study employed a novel logarithmic scaling technique to
unify conflicting metrics and enable comprehensive multi-quality assessment
within the Taguchi framework. Results demonstrate that Approach 3, combining
weighted accuracy metrics with logarithmically transformed loss functions,
achieved optimal performance with 98.84% training accuracy and 86.25%
validation accuracy while maintaining minimal loss values. The Taguchi analysis
revealed that learning rate emerged as the most influential parameter, followed
by image size and activation function, providing clear guidance for
hyperparameter prioritization in CNN optimization.

Result: CoA-LoRA无需额外时间成本，性能优于或媲美现有方法。

Conclusion: CoA-LoRA高效解决了量化配置的动态适配问题。

Abstract: As increasingly large pre-trained models are released, deploying them on edge
devices for privacy-preserving applications requires effective compression.
Recent works combine quantization with the fine-tuning of high-precision LoRA
adapters, which can substantially reduce model size while mitigating the
accuracy loss from quantization. However, edge devices have inherently
heterogeneous capabilities, while performing configuration-wise fine-tuning for
every quantization setting is computationally prohibitive. In this paper, we
propose CoA-LoRA, a method that dynamically adjusts the LoRA adapter to
arbitrary quantization configurations (i.e., the per-layer bit-width choices of
a pre-trained model) without requiring repeated fine-tuning. This is
accomplished via a configuration-aware model that maps each configuration to
its low-rank adjustments. The effectiveness of this model critically depends on
the training configuration set, a collection of configurations chosen to cover
different total bit-width budgets. However, constructing a high-quality
configuration set is non-trivial. We therefore design a Pareto-based
configuration search that iteratively optimizes the training configuration set,
yielding more precise low-rank adjustments. Our experiments demonstrate that,
unlike the state-of-the-art methods that require fine-tuning a separate LoRA
adapter for each configuration, CoA-LoRA incurs no additional time cost while
achieving comparable or even superior performance to those methods.

Motivation: 多元时间序列中的异常检测通常需要处理复杂的变量间关系，传统方法可能无法有效保留这些关系，因此需要一种新的方法来分区并保持变量间关系。

Conclusion: PARADISE是一种有效的非监督分区方法，能够显著提升多元时间序列中的异常检测效果。

Abstract: In this article, we suggest a novel non-supervised partition based anomaly
detection method for anomaly detection in multivariate time series called
PARADISE. This methodology creates a partition of the variables of the time
series while ensuring that the inter-variable relations remain untouched. This
partitioning relies on the clustering of multiple correlation coefficients
between variables to identify subsets of variables before executing anomaly
detection algorithms locally for each of those subsets. Through multiple
experimentations done on both synthetic and real datasets coming from the
literature, we show the relevance of our approach with a significant
improvement in anomaly detection performance.

complexity grows. Recent work, however, has introduced the notion of a second
descent in test error beyond the interpolation threshold-giving rise to the
so-called double descent phenomenon. While double descent has been studied
extensively in the context of deep learning, it has also been reported in
simpler models, including decision trees and gradient boosting. In this work,
we revisit these claims through the lens of classical machine learning applied
to a biological classification task: predicting isoniazid resistance in
Mycobacterium tuberculosis using whole-genome sequencing data. We
systematically vary model complexity along two orthogonal axes-learner capacity
(e.g., Pleaf, Pboost) and ensemble size (i.e., Pens)-and show that double
descent consistently emerges only when complexity is scaled jointly across
these axes. When either axis is held fixed, generalisation behaviour reverts to
classical U- or L-shaped patterns. These results are replicated on a synthetic
benchmark and support the unfolding hypothesis, which attributes double descent
to the projection of distinct generalisation regimes onto a single complexity
axis. Our findings underscore the importance of treating model complexity as a
multidimensional construct when analysing generalisation behaviour. All code

Result: 在复杂MPE查询中，L2C显著减少搜索空间，解质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: L2C为PGMs中的MPE推理提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce learning to condition (L2C), a scalable, data-driven framework
for accelerating Most Probable Explanation (MPE) inference in Probabilistic
Graphical Models (PGMs), a fundamentally intractable problem. L2C trains a
neural network to score variable-value assignments based on their utility for
conditioning, given observed evidence. To facilitate supervised learning, we
develop a scalable data generation pipeline that extracts training signals from
the search traces of existing MPE solvers. The trained network serves as a
heuristic that integrates with search algorithms, acting as a conditioning
strategy prior to exact inference or as a branching and node selection policy
within branch-and-bound solvers. We evaluate L2C on challenging MPE queries
involving high-treewidth PGMs. Experiments show that our learned heuristic
significantly reduces the search space while maintaining or improving solution
quality over state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 采用DES-Clustering方法，实现TinyDES-Clustering库，针对嵌入式系统限制进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，更大的分类器池能提高分类准确性，但会增加平均推理时间。

Conclusion: DES-Clustering方法在TinyML系统中能有效平衡分类质量和推理时间，但需权衡准确性和延迟。

Abstract: The recent progress in TinyML technologies triggers the need to address the
challenge of balancing inference time and classification quality. TinyML
systems are defined by specific constraints in computation, memory and energy.
These constraints emphasize the need for specialized optimization techniques
when implementing Machine Learning (ML) applications on such platforms. While
deep neural networks are widely used in TinyML, the exploration of Dynamic
Ensemble Selection (DES) methods is also beneficial. This study examines a
DES-Clustering approach for a multi-class computer vision task within TinyML
systems. This method allows for adjusting classification accuracy, thereby
affecting latency and energy consumption per inference. We implemented the
TinyDES-Clustering library, optimized for embedded system limitations.
Experiments have shown that a larger pool of classifiers for dynamic selection
improves classification accuracy, and thus leads to an increase in average
inference time on the TinyML device.

Abstract: We propose a physics-informed machine-learned framework for sensor-based flow
estimation for drone trajectories in complex urban terrain. The input is a rich
set of flow simulations at many wind conditions. The outputs are velocity and
uncertainty estimates for a target domain and subsequent sensor optimization
for minimal uncertainty. The framework has three innovations compared to
traditional flow estimators. First, the algorithm scales proportionally to the
domain complexity, making it suitable for flows that are too complex for any
monolithic reduced-order representation. Second, the framework extrapolates
beyond the training data, e.g., smaller and larger wind velocities. Last, and
perhaps most importantly, the sensor location is a free input, significantly
extending the vast majority of the literature. The key enablers are (1) a
Reynolds number-based scaling of the flow variables, (2) a physics-based domain
decomposition, (3) a cluster-based flow representation for each subdomain, (4)
an information entropy correlating the subdomains, and (5) a multi-variate
probability function relating sensor input and targeted velocity estimates.
This framework is demonstrated using drone flight paths through a
three-building cluster as a simple example. We anticipate adaptations and
applications for estimating complete cities and incorporating weather input.

Motivation: 现有线性注意力方法在捕捉长距离模式时存在表达瓶颈，限制了其性能。

Method: 通过预测-校正视角重新审视线性注意力，提出RLA框架，引入显式残差拟合机制，并实例化为RDN，结合自适应门控和残差裁剪。

Result: RLA和RDN在语言建模和召回密集型任务中表现优于基线和其他现代线性注意力方法，缩小了与标准Transformers的差距。

Conclusion: RLA和RDN通过残差拟合机制有效提升了线性注意力的表达能力，同时保持了线性复杂度。

Abstract: Linear attention offers a linear-time alternative to self-attention but often
struggles to capture long-range patterns. We revisit linear attention through a
prediction-correction lens and show that prevalent variants can be written as a
combination of a historical prediction and a single-token correction, which
creates an expressivity bottleneck. To address this bottleneck, we introduce
Residual Linear Attention (RLA), a framework that equips linear attention with
an explicit residual-fitting mechanism. RLA maintains an auxiliary recurrent
state that learns to accumulate residual errors over time and correct the base
prediction. We further instantiate a delta-rule version, Residual Delta Net
(RDN), incorporating adaptive gating and residual clipping for enhanced
correction control and stability. Our implementation leverages highly optimized
linear attention kernels and preserves linear time and memory. Across language
modeling and recall-intensive evaluations, RLA and RDN consistently outperform
their respective baselines and other modern linear-attention methods, narrowing
the gap to standard Transformers while retaining linear scaling.

Conclusion: AMLA成功提升性能，并即将集成到华为CANN中发布。

Abstract: Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) significantly reduces KVCache memory usage
in Large Language Models while introducing substantial computational overhead
and intermediate variable expansion. This poses challenges for efficient
hardware implementation -- especially during the decode phase. This paper
introduces Ascend MLA (AMLA), a high-performance kernel specifically optimized
for Huawei's Ascend NPUs. AMLA is built on two core innovations: (1) A novel
FlashAttention-based algorithm that replaces floating-point multiplications
with integer additions for output block rescaling, leveraging binary
correspondence between FP32 and INT32 representations; (2) A Preload Pipeline
strategy with hierarchical tiling that maximizes FLOPS utilization: the Preload
Pipeline achieves Cube-bound performance, while hierarchical tiling overlaps
data movement and computation within the Cube core. Experiments show that on
Ascend 910 NPUs (integrated in CloudMatrix384), AMLA achieves up to 614 TFLOPS,
reaching 86.8% of the theoretical maximum FLOPS, outperforming the
state-of-the-art open-source FlashMLA implementation, whose FLOPS utilization
is up to 66.7% on NVIDIA H800 SXM5. The AMLA kernel has been integrated into
Huawei's CANN and will be released soon.

Motivation: 当前方法在捕捉多尺度蛋白质-配体相互作用时存在局限性，忽略了其层次结构和内在不对称性。

Method: 提出MSCoD框架，结合多尺度信息瓶颈（MSIB）和多头协作注意力机制（MHCA），实现高效层次特征提取和不对称相互作用建模。

Result: MSCoD在基准数据集上优于现有方法，并在KRAS G12D等挑战性目标中验证了实用性。

Conclusion: MSCoD为结构药物设计提供了更高效的解决方案，适用于复杂蛋白质-配体相互作用建模。

Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) is a powerful strategy in computational
drug discovery, utilizing three-dimensional protein structures to guide the
design of molecules with improved binding affinity. However, capturing complex
protein-ligand interactions across multiple scales remains challenging, as
current methods often overlook the hierarchical organization and intrinsic
asymmetry of these interactions. To address these limitations, we propose
MSCoD, a novel Bayesian updating-based generative framework for structure-based
drug design. In our MSCoD, Multi-Scale Information Bottleneck (MSIB) was
developed, which enables semantic compression at multiple abstraction levels
for efficient hierarchical feature extraction. Furthermore, a multi-head
cooperative attention (MHCA) mechanism was developed, which employs asymmetric
protein-to-ligand attention to capture diverse interaction types while
addressing the dimensionality disparity between proteins and ligands. Empirical
studies showed that MSCoD outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark
dataset. Case studies on challenging targets such as KRAS G12D further
demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The code and data

Result: 实验表明，该框架在MAPE、RMSE和MAE指标上显著优于基准模型，具有更高的预测精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为集成海洋能源系统的超短期预测提供了高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Integrated wind-solar-wave marine energy systems hold broad promise for
supplying clean electricity in offshore and coastal regions. By leveraging the
spatiotemporal complementarity of multiple resources, such systems can
effectively mitigate the intermittency and volatility of single-source outputs,
thereby substantially improving overall power-generation efficiency and
resource utilization. Accurate ultra-short-term forecasting is crucial for
ensuring secure operation and optimizing proactive dispatch. However, most
existing forecasting methods construct separate models for each energy source,
insufficiently account for the complex couplings among multiple energies,
struggle to capture the system's nonlinear and nonstationary dynamics, and
typically depend on extensive manual parameter tuning-limitations that
constrain both predictive performance and practicality. We address this issue
using a Bayesian-optimized Multivariate Variational Mode Decomposition-Long
Short-Term Memory (MVMD-LSTM) framework. The framework first applies MVMD to
jointly decompose wind, solar and wave power series so as to preserve
cross-source couplings; it uses Bayesian optimization to automatically search
the number of modes and the penalty parameter in the MVMD process to obtain
intrinsic mode functions (IMFs); finally, an LSTM models the resulting IMFs to
achieve ultra-short-term power forecasting for the integrated system.
Experiments based on field measurements from an offshore integrated energy
platform in China show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
benchmark models in terms of MAPE, RMSE and MAE. The results demonstrate
superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and degree of automation.

Result: RPFs高效且提供闭式Riemannian体积校正项，在生成建模中表现优异。

Conclusion: RPFs为生成建模提供了强基线，连接了随机投影理论与归一化流。

Abstract: We introduce Random Projection Flows (RPFs), a principled framework for
injective normalizing flows that leverages tools from random matrix theory and
the geometry of random projections. RPFs employ random semi-orthogonal
matrices, drawn from Haar-distributed orthogonal ensembles via QR decomposition
of Gaussian matrices, to project data into lower-dimensional latent spaces for
the base distribution. Unlike PCA-based flows or learned injective maps, RPFs
are plug-and-play, efficient, and yield closed-form expressions for the
Riemannian volume correction term. We demonstrate that RPFs are both
theoretically grounded and practically effective, providing a strong baseline
for generative modeling and a bridge between random projection theory and
normalizing flows.

Abstract: A useful inductive bias for temporal data is that trajectories should stay
close to the data manifold. Traditional flow matching relies on straight
conditional paths, and flow matching methods which learn geodesics rely on RBF
kernels or nearest neighbor graphs that suffer from the curse of
dimensionality. We propose to use score matching and annealed energy
distillation to learn a metric tensor that faithfully captures the underlying
data geometry and informs more accurate flows. We demonstrate the efficacy of
this strategy on synthetic manifolds with analytic geodesics, and interpolation
of cell

Conclusion: WDformer通过结合小波变换和差分注意力机制，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性，并减少了噪声干扰。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has various applications, such as meteorological
rainfall prediction, traffic flow analysis, financial forecasting, and
operational load monitoring for various systems. Due to the sparsity of time
series data, relying solely on time-domain or frequency-domain modeling limits
the model's ability to fully leverage multi-domain information. Moreover, when
applied to time series forecasting tasks, traditional attention mechanisms tend
to over-focus on irrelevant historical information, which may introduce noise
into the prediction process, leading to biased results. We proposed WDformer, a
wavelet-based differential Transformer model. This study employs the wavelet
transform to conduct a multi-resolution analysis of time series data. By
leveraging the advantages of joint representation in the time-frequency domain,
it accurately extracts the key information components that reflect the
essential characteristics of the data. Furthermore, we apply attention
mechanisms on inverted dimensions, allowing the attention mechanism to capture
relationships between multiple variables. When performing attention
calculations, we introduced the differential attention mechanism, which
computes the attention score by taking the difference between two separate
softmax attention matrices. This approach enables the model to focus more on
important information and reduce noise. WDformer has achieved state-of-the-art
(SOTA) results on multiple challenging real-world datasets, demonstrating its
accuracy and effectiveness. Code is available at

Result: 在温和条件下，优化-重采样方案能产生一致的近似结果，实验验证了其准确性和速度。

Conclusion: GMA采样器是一种高效、准确的采样方法，适用于多样化的目标密度。

Abstract: We present a family of \textit{Gaussian Mixture Approximation} (GMA) samplers
for sampling unnormalised target densities, encompassing \textit{weights-only
GMA} (W-GMA), \textit{Laplace Mixture Approximation} (LMA),
\textit{expectation-maximization GMA} (EM-GMA), and further variants. GMA
adopts a simple two-stage paradigm: (i) initialise a finite set of Gaussian
components and draw samples from a proposal mixture; (ii) fit the mixture to
the target by optimising either only the component weights or also the means
and variances, via a sample-based KL divergence objective that requires only
evaluations of the unnormalised density, followed by stratified resampling. The
method is gradient-free, and computationally efficient: it leverages the ease
of sampling from Gaussians, efficient optimisation methods (projected gradient
descent, mirror descent, and EM), and the robustness of stratified resampling
to produce samples faithful to the target. We show that this
optimisation-resampling scheme yields consistent approximations under mild
conditions, and we validate this methodology with empirical results
demonstrating accuracy and speed across diverse densities.

Motivation: 在车联网等高动态异构网络中，传统联邦学习面临数据异构性高的挑战，需要改进模型精度和资源效率。

Method: 提出FedCLF，结合校准损失作为参与者选择标准，并引入反馈控制动态调整客户端采样频率。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，FedCLF比基线模型（如FedAvg）在高异构场景下性能提升16%，同时减少采样频率。

Conclusion: FedCLF有效解决了高异构数据下的联邦学习问题，提升了模型精度和资源效率。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning technique that
preserves data privacy by sharing only the trained parameters instead of the
client data. This makes FL ideal for highly dynamic, heterogeneous, and
time-critical applications, in particular, the Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
networks. However, FL encounters considerable challenges in such networks owing
to the high data and device heterogeneity. To address these challenges, we
propose FedCLF, i.e., FL with Calibrated Loss and Feedback control, which
introduces calibrated loss as a utility in the participant selection process
and a feedback control mechanism to dynamically adjust the sampling frequency
of the clients. The envisaged approach (a) enhances the overall model accuracy
in case of highly heterogeneous data and (b) optimizes the resource utilization
for resource constrained IoV networks, thereby leading to increased efficiency
in the FL process. We evaluated FedCLF vis-\`a-vis baseline models, i.e.,
FedAvg, Newt, and Oort, using CIFAR-10 dataset with varying data heterogeneity.
Our results depict that FedCLF significantly outperforms the baseline models by
up to a 16% improvement in high data heterogeneity-related scenarios with
improved efficiency via reduced sampling frequency.

Abstract: Correct identification of failure mechanisms is essential for manufacturers
to ensure the quality of their products. Certain failures of printheads
developed by Canon Production Printing can be identified from the behavior of
individual nozzles, the states of which are constantly recorded and can form
distinct patterns in terms of the number of failed nozzles over time, and in
space in the nozzle grid. In our work, we investigate the problem of printhead
failure classification based on a multifaceted dataset of nozzle logging and
propose a Machine Learning classification approach for this problem. We follow
the feature-based framework of time-series classification, where a set of
time-based and spatial features was selected with the guidance of domain
experts. Several traditional ML classifiers were evaluated, and the One-vs-Rest
Random Forest was found to have the best performance. The proposed model
outperformed an in-house rule-based baseline in terms of a weighted F1 score
for several failure mechanisms.

Result: PALADIN在多个指标上显著提升，恢复率从23.75%提升至89.86%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: PALADIN是一种有效的方法，能够构建在真实工具环境中具有鲁棒恢复能力的代理。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language agents frequently fail in real-world deployment due
to tool malfunctions--timeouts, API exceptions, or inconsistent
outputs--triggering cascading reasoning errors and task abandonment. Existing
agent training pipelines optimize only for success trajectories, failing to
expose models to the tool failures that dominate real-world usage. We propose
\textbf{PALADIN}, a generalizable framework for equipping language agents with
robust failure recovery capabilities. PALADIN trains on 50,000+
recovery-annotated trajectories constructed via systematic failure injection
and expert demonstrations on an enhanced ToolBench dataset. Training uses
LoRA-based fine-tuning to retain base capabilities while injecting recovery
competence. At inference, PALADIN detects execution-time errors and retrieves
the most similar case from a curated bank of 55+ failure exemplars aligned with
ToolScan's taxonomy, then executes the corresponding recovery action. This
approach generalizes to novel failures beyond the training distribution,
retaining 95.2\% recovery performance on unseen tool APIs. Evaluation across
PaladinEval and ToolReflectEval demonstrates consistent improvements in
Recovery Rate (RR), Task Success Rate (TSR), Catastrophic Success Rate (CSR),
and Efficiency Score (ES). PALADIN improves RR from 32.76% to 89.68% (+57%
relative) over ToolBench and outperforms the strongest baseline CRITIC (76.34%)
by +13.3%. Against vanilla agents, PALADIN achieves 89.86\% RR (+66% relative
improvement from 23.75%). These results establish PALADIN as an effective
method for building fault-tolerant agents capable of robust recovery in
real-world tool environments.

Abstract: Recent curriculum reinforcement learning for large language models (LLMs)
typically rely on difficulty-based annotations for data filtering and ordering.
However, such methods suffer from local optimization, where continual training
on simple samples in the early steps can cause the policy to lose its
exploration. We propose a novel schema, namely Hamiltonian curiosity augmented
large language model reinforcement (HAMMER), that transfers diversity metrics,
commonly used in dataset evaluation, into the dynamic reinforcement learning
procedure, where training samples are ordered via a minimum-semantic
Hamiltonian path making the initial training retrain more exploration. From a
theoretical perspective of generalization bounds, diversity-driven ordering
facilitates stable convergence. Empirical evaluations indicate that HAMMER
stimulates model "curiosity" and consistently achieves a 3% to 4% average
accuracy gain across diverse inference benchmark.

Abstract: Recent advancements in training paradigms for Large Language Models (LLMs)
have unlocked their remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and
cross-domain generalization. While LLMs excel in tasks like programming and
mathematical problem-solving, their zero-shot performance in specialized
domains requiring expert knowledge, such as cybersecurity, is often suboptimal.
This limitation arises because foundational LLMs are designed for
general-purpose applications, constraining their ability to encapsulate
domain-specific expertise within their parameter space. To address this, we
explore fine-tuning strategies to embed cybersecurity knowledge into LLMs,
enhancing their performance in cybersecurity question-answering (Q\&A) tasks
while prioritizing computational efficiency. Specifically, we investigate
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), and Quantized
Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) using a cybersecurity Q\&A dataset. Our results
demonstrate that these fine-tuning approaches significantly outperform the
foundational model in cybersecurity Q\&A tasks. Moreover, LoRA and QLoRA
achieve comparable performance to SFT with substantially lower computational
costs, offering an efficient pathway for adapting LLMs to specialized domains.
Our work highlights the potential of low-rank fine-tuning strategies to bridge
the gap between general-purpose LLMs and domain-specific applications.

Conclusion: 新方法展示了将特征几何整合到现有蒸馏方法中的潜力。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a common paradigm for transferring capabilities
from larger models to smaller ones. While traditional distillation methods
leverage a probabilistic divergence over the output of the teacher and student
models, feature-based distillation methods often minimize variants of Euclidean
norms between the hidden layer representations. The main goal is for the
student to mimic the structure of the feature space of the teacher. In this
work, we theoretically show that existing feature distillation methods, such as
projection based mean squared loss or Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA), cannot
capture the feature structure, even under zero loss. We then motivate the use
of Procrustes distance and the Frobenius norm of Feature Gram Matrix, distances
already common in the context of measuring representational alignment, as
distillation losses. We show that feature distillation through our method
showcases statistically significant improvement in distillation performance
across language models families (BERT and OPT) in classification and
instruction-following tasks by up to 2 percentage points, showcasing the
potential of integrating feature geometry into existing distillation methods.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法有效解决了无人机辅助群智感知中的资源优化问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-assisted mobile crowdsensing (MCS) has
emerged as a promising paradigm for data collection. However, challenges such
as spectrum scarcity, device heterogeneity, and user mobility hinder efficient
coordination of sensing, communication, and computation. To tackle these
issues, we propose a joint optimization framework that integrates time slot
partition for sensing, communication, and computation phases, resource
allocation, and UAV 3D trajectory planning, aiming to maximize the amount of
processed sensing data. The problem is formulated as a non-convex stochastic
optimization and further modeled as a partially observable Markov decision
process (POMDP) that can be solved by multi-agent deep reinforcement learning
(MADRL) algorithm. To overcome the limitations of conventional multi-layer
perceptron (MLP) networks, we design a novel MADRL algorithm with hybrid actor
network. The newly developed method is based on heterogeneous agent proximal
policy optimization (HAPPO), empowered by convolutional neural networks (CNN)
for feature extraction and Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN) to capture
structured state-action dependencies. Extensive numerical results demonstrate
that our proposed method achieves significant improvements in the amount of
processed sensing data when compared with other benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气象预测基准主要针对周期性强的变量（如温度、湿度），无法反映模型在复杂降雨临近预报中的能力，因此需要专门的数据集和评估方法。

Method: 提出了RainfallBench数据集，包含5年全球12,000多个GNSS站点的数据，并设计了BFPF模块以解决零膨胀和时间衰减问题。

Result: 评估了20多种先进模型，验证了数据集的全面性和BFPF模块的优越性。

Conclusion: RainfallBench为降雨临近预报提供了更全面的评估基准，BFPF模块显著提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Rainfall nowcasting, which aims to predict precipitation within the next 0 to
3 hours, is critical for disaster mitigation and real-time response planning.
However, most time series forecasting benchmarks in meteorology are evaluated
on variables with strong periodicity, such as temperature and humidity, which
fail to reflect model capabilities in more complex and practically meteorology
scenarios like rainfall nowcasting. To address this gap, we propose
RainfallBench, a benchmark designed for rainfall nowcasting, a highly
challenging and practically relevant task characterized by zero inflation,
temporal decay, and non-stationarity, focused on predicting precipitation
within the next 0 to 3 hours. The dataset is derived from five years of
meteorological observations, recorded at 15-minute intervals across six
essential variables, and collected from more than 12,000 GNSS stations
globally. In particular, it incorporates precipitable water vapor (PWV), a
crucial indicator of rainfall that is absent in other datasets. We further
design specialized evaluation strategies to assess model performance on key
meteorological challenges, such as multi-scale prediction and extreme rainfall
events, and evaluate over 20 state-of-the-art models across six major
architectures on RainfallBench. Additionally, to address the zero-inflation and
temporal decay issues overlooked by existing models, we introduce Bi-Focus
Precipitation Forecaster (BFPF), a plug-and-play module that incorporates
domain-specific priors to enhance rainfall time series forecasting. Statistical
analysis and ablation studies validate the comprehensiveness of our dataset as
well as the superiority of our methodology. Code and datasets are available at

TL;DR: PPN是一个轻量级强化学习框架，通过自适应策略选择优化LLM的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态提示策略（如Zero-Shot、Few-Shot或CoT）在效率和准确性之间存在僵化的权衡，高准确策略（如SC）在简单任务上浪费计算资源，而轻量级方法在复杂输入上表现不佳。

Method: 提出Prompt Policy Network (PPN)，基于强化学习框架，将自适应策略选择建模为单步马尔可夫决策过程（MDP），使用PPO训练，并通过资源显式奖励函数指导。

Result: 在算术推理基准测试中，PPN在效率-准确性帕累托前沿表现优异，相比Self-Consistency减少61.5%的token成本，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: PPN为LLM部署提供了一个系统化、自适应的成本优化框架，推动了轻量级优化技术在可扩展和可持续语言模型应用中的设计。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) depends heavily on the chosen
prompting strategy, yet static approaches such as Zero-Shot, Few-Shot, or
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) impose a rigid efficiency-accuracy trade-off. Highly
accurate strategies like Self-Consistency (SC) incur substantial computational
waste on simple tasks, while lightweight methods often fail on complex inputs.
This paper introduces the Prompt Policy Network (PPN), a lightweight
reinforcement learning framework that formalizes adaptive strategy selection as
a single-step Markov Decision Process (MDP). The PPN, trained with Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) and guided by a resource-explicit reward function,
learns to allocate costly reasoning strategies only when necessary. Experiments
on arithmetic reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PPN achieves superior
performance on the efficiency-accuracy Pareto front, delivering up to 61.5%
token cost reduction compared to Self-Consistency while maintaining competitive
accuracy. This work contributes a systematic, adaptive framework for
cost-efficient LLM deployment, advancing the design of lightweight optimization
techniques for scalable and sustainable language model applications.

Conclusion: WFMs结合高保真数据可成为下一代电网韧性智能的实用基础。

Abstract: Weather foundation models (WFMs) have recently set new benchmarks in global
forecast skill, yet their concrete value for the weather-sensitive
infrastructure that powers modern society remains largely unexplored. In this
study, we fine-tune Silurian AI's 1.5B-parameter WFM, Generative Forecasting
Transformer (GFT), on a rich archive of Hydro-Qu\'ebec asset
observations--including transmission-line weather stations, wind-farm met-mast
streams, and icing sensors--to deliver hyper-local, asset-level forecasts for
five grid-critical variables: surface temperature, precipitation, hub-height
wind speed, wind-turbine icing risk, and rime-ice accretion on overhead
conductors. Across 6-72 h lead times, the tailored model surpasses
state-of-the-art NWP benchmarks, trimming temperature mean absolute error (MAE)
by 15%, total-precipitation MAE by 35%, and lowering wind speed MAE by 15%.
Most importantly, it attains an average precision score of 0.72 for day-ahead
rime-ice detection, a capability absent from existing operational systems,
which affords several hours of actionable warning for potentially catastrophic
outage events. These results show that WFMs, when post-trained with small
amounts of high-fidelity, can serve as a practical foundation for
next-generation grid-resilience intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以有效捕捉多模态间的协同信息，导致在依赖此类交互的任务中表现不佳。

Method: 采用无限掩码策略，随机遮挡模态特征以生成多样化的协同模式，并通过互信息最大化对齐掩码与非掩码表示。

Result: 在七项基准测试中达到最优性能，验证了InfMasking对协同信息提取的有效性。

Conclusion: InfMasking通过创新的掩码策略成功提升了多模态协同信息的捕获能力，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: In multimodal representation learning, synergistic interactions between
modalities not only provide complementary information but also create unique
outcomes through specific interaction patterns that no single modality could
achieve alone. Existing methods may struggle to effectively capture the full
spectrum of synergistic information, leading to suboptimal performance in tasks
where such interactions are critical. This is particularly problematic because
synergistic information constitutes the fundamental value proposition of
multimodal representation. To address this challenge, we introduce InfMasking,
a contrastive synergistic information extraction method designed to enhance
synergistic information through an \textbf{Inf}inite \textbf{Masking} strategy.
InfMasking stochastically occludes most features from each modality during
fusion, preserving only partial information to create representations with
varied synergistic patterns. Unmasked fused representations are then aligned
with masked ones through mutual information maximization to encode
comprehensive synergistic information. This infinite masking strategy enables
capturing richer interactions by exposing the model to diverse partial modality
combinations during training. As computing mutual information estimates with
infinite masking is computationally prohibitive, we derive an InfMasking loss
to approximate this calculation. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate
that InfMasking effectively enhances synergistic information between
modalities. In evaluations on large-scale real-world datasets, InfMasking
achieves state-of-the-art performance across seven benchmarks. Code is released
at https://github.com/brightest66/InfMasking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法在现实场景中存在依赖单一主模态、成对建模和完整模态假设的局限性，MAESTRO旨在克服这些问题。

Method: MAESTRO通过动态模态交互、符号标记化和自适应注意力预算构建长序列，并利用稀疏MoE机制处理不同模态组合。

Result: 在四个数据集上，MAESTRO比现有方法平均提升4%（多模态）和8%（多变量），在40%缺失模态下仍提升9%。

Conclusion: MAESTRO的稀疏模态感知设计在动态时间序列学习中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: From clinical healthcare to daily living, continuous sensor monitoring across
multiple modalities has shown great promise for real-world intelligent
decision-making but also faces various challenges. In this work, we introduce
MAESTRO, a novel framework that overcomes key limitations of existing
multimodal learning approaches: (1) reliance on a single primary modality for
alignment, (2) pairwise modeling of modalities, and (3) assumption of complete
modality observations. These limitations hinder the applicability of these
approaches in real-world multimodal time-series settings, where primary
modality priors are often unclear, the number of modalities can be large
(making pairwise modeling impractical), and sensor failures often result in
arbitrary missing observations. At its core, MAESTRO facilitates dynamic intra-
and cross-modal interactions based on task relevance, and leverages symbolic
tokenization and adaptive attention budgeting to construct long multimodal
sequences, which are processed via sparse cross-modal attention. The resulting
cross-modal tokens are routed through a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
mechanism, enabling black-box specialization under varying modality
combinations. We evaluate MAESTRO against 10 baselines on four diverse datasets
spanning three applications, and observe average relative improvements of 4%
and 8% over the best existing multimodal and multivariate approaches,
respectively, under complete observations. Under partial observations -- with
up to 40% of missing modalities -- MAESTRO achieves an average 9% improvement.
Further analysis also demonstrates the robustness and efficiency of MAESTRO's
sparse, modality-aware design for learning from dynamic time series.

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了DRL在未来异构网络设计中的关键权衡。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation in heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets) is
challenging for traditional methods under varying user loads and channel

multi-objective reward balancing throughput, energy efficiency, and fairness.
Using real base station coordinates, we compare Proximal Policy Optimisation
(PPO) and Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) against three

frameworks outperform heuristic algorithms in optimising resource allocation in
dynamic networks. These findings highlight key trade-offs in DRL design for

Conclusion: ClustRecNet在聚类算法推荐任务中表现出色，为无监督学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ClustRecNet - a novel deep learning (DL)-based recommendation
framework for determining the most suitable clustering algorithms for a given
dataset, addressing the long-standing challenge of clustering algorithm
selection in unsupervised learning. To enable supervised learning in this
context, we construct a comprehensive data repository comprising 34,000
synthetic datasets with diverse structural properties. Each of them was
processed using 10 popular clustering algorithms. The resulting clusterings
were assessed via the Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) to establish ground truth
labels, used for training and evaluation of our DL model. The proposed network
architecture integrates convolutional, residual, and attention mechanisms to
capture both local and global structural patterns from the input data. This
design supports end-to-end training to learn compact representations of
datasets and enables direct recommendation of the most suitable clustering
algorithm, reducing reliance on handcrafted meta-features and traditional
Cluster Validity Indices (CVIs). Comprehensive experiments across synthetic and
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our DL model consistently outperforms
conventional CVIs (e.g. Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, Davies-Bouldin, and
Dunn) as well as state-of-the-art AutoML clustering recommendation approaches
(e.g. ML2DAC, AutoCluster, and AutoML4Clust). Notably, the proposed model
achieves a 0.497 ARI improvement over the Calinski-Harabasz index on synthetic
data and a 15.3% ARI gain over the best-performing AutoML approach on
real-world data.

Conclusion: 为通过RL后训练高效扩展LLM的推理能力提供了理论基础和实践指南。

Abstract: While scaling laws for large language models (LLMs) during pre-training have
been extensively studied, their behavior under reinforcement learning (RL)
post-training remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a systematic
empirical investigation of scaling behaviors in RL-based post-training, with a
particular focus on mathematical reasoning. Based on 54 experiments across
diverse model sizes and training settings, we characterize how model scale,
data volume, and computational budget interact to shape performance. Our
analysis leads to four key findings: (1). Under a fixed computational budget,
larger models trained for fewer steps consistently outperform smaller models
trained for more steps. (2). Given a fixed amount of training data, larger
models achieve superior sample efficiency, yielding lower loss. (3). In
data-constrained regimes, repeated reuse of high-quality data proves highly
effective, as final performance is primarily governed by the total number of
optimization steps rather than the uniqueness of samples. (4). These scaling
behaviors are robust across both base and instruction-tuned models, which share
similar learning dynamics (e.g., larger models show faster convergence) even
while differing in absolute accuracy. Collectively, these results provide a
principled foundation and practical guidelines for efficiently scaling the
reasoning capabilities of LLMs through RL post-training.

Motivation: 传统过采样方法（如SMOTE）依赖局部线性插值，可能生成不合理的合成样本；而深度生成模型（如CVAE）虽能捕捉非线性分布，但忽视了边界区域样本的重要性。

Method: LEO-CVAE通过局部熵量化不确定性，并利用局部熵加权损失（LEWL）和熵引导采样策略，在不确定区域进行数据生成。

Result: 在临床基因组数据集（ADNI和TCGA肺癌）上，LEO-CVAE显著提升了分类器性能，优于传统过采样和生成基线方法。

Conclusion: LEO-CVAE展示了在复杂非线性结构数据（如组学数据）中，不确定性感知的生成过采样对不平衡学习的价值。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a major challenge in machine learning, especially for
high-dimensional biomedical data where nonlinear manifold structures dominate.
Traditional oversampling methods such as SMOTE rely on local linear
interpolation, often producing implausible synthetic samples. Deep generative
models like Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) better capture
nonlinear distributions, but standard variants treat all minority samples
equally, neglecting the importance of uncertain, boundary-region examples
emphasized by heuristic methods like Borderline-SMOTE and ADASYN.
  We propose Local Entropy-Guided Oversampling with a CVAE (LEO-CVAE), a
generative oversampling framework that explicitly incorporates local
uncertainty into both representation learning and data generation. To quantify
uncertainty, we compute Shannon entropy over the class distribution in a
sample's neighborhood: high entropy indicates greater class overlap, serving as
a proxy for uncertainty. LEO-CVAE leverages this signal through two mechanisms:
(i) a Local Entropy-Weighted Loss (LEWL) that emphasizes robust learning in
uncertain regions, and (ii) an entropy-guided sampling strategy that
concentrates generation in these informative, class-overlapping areas.
  Applied to clinical genomics datasets (ADNI and TCGA lung cancer), LEO-CVAE
consistently improves classifier performance, outperforming both traditional
oversampling and generative baselines. These results highlight the value of
uncertainty-aware generative oversampling for imbalanced learning in domains
governed by complex nonlinear structures, such as omics data.

Method: 通过标量-向量分解推导临界步长，分析正则化对收敛敏感性的影响，并扩展到正交初始化的矩阵分解。

Result: 发现临界步长附近会引发混沌动态，导致长期行为不可预测，且缺乏简单的隐式偏好。

Conclusion: 研究表明，临界步长附近的梯度下降具有混沌特性，动态行为复杂且难以预测。

Abstract: We examine gradient descent in matrix factorization and show that under large
step sizes the parameter space develops a fractal structure. We derive the
exact critical step size for convergence in scalar-vector factorization and
show that near criticality the selected minimizer depends sensitively on the
initialization. Moreover, we show that adding regularization amplifies this
sensitivity, generating a fractal boundary between initializations that
converge and those that diverge. The analysis extends to general matrix
factorization with orthogonal initialization. Our findings reveal that
near-critical step sizes induce a chaotic regime of gradient descent where the
long-term dynamics are unpredictable and there are no simple implicit biases,
such as towards balancedness, minimum norm, or flatness.

Abstract: Protein structure prediction and folding are fundamental to understanding
biology, with recent deep learning advances reshaping the field.
Diffusion-based generative models have revolutionized protein design, enabling
the creation of novel proteins. However, these methods often neglect the
intrinsic physical realism of proteins, driven by noising dynamics that lack
grounding in physical principles. To address this, we first introduce a
physically motivated non-linear noising process, grounded in classical physics,
that unfolds proteins into secondary structures (e.g., alpha helices, linear
beta sheets) while preserving topological integrity--maintaining bonds, and
preventing collisions. We then integrate this process with the flow-matching
paradigm on SE(3) to model the invariant distribution of protein backbones with
high fidelity, incorporating sequence information to enable
sequence-conditioned folding and expand the generative capabilities of our
model. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in unconditional protein generation, producing
more designable and novel protein structures while accurately folding monomer
sequences into precise protein conformations.

Conclusion: TREC为数据课程设计提供了新工具，可显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Data curriculums have become central to successful LLM training, yet
principles governing optimal data placement remain unclear. We introduce the
*training re-evaluation curve (TREC)*, a diagnostic that retrospectively
evaluates training batches *using the final model weights*. The TREC
characterizes how well a trained model retains training data as a function of
*when* the data was encountered during training. Analyzing TRECs for models
from 111M to 3.9B parameters, we show that placing high-quality data at low
points on the TREC significantly improves performance. Importantly, while a
TREC is initially observable only after training, we demonstrate it can be
*predicted in advance* from AdamW's implicit EMA coefficients, enabling
proactive curriculum design. By predicting TRECs for published training
recipes, we explain prior ablations and reveal suboptimal data placements. We
also align high-quality data with TREC minima in order to improve continual
pre-training of a 3.9B-parameter LLM trained on 900B tokens.

Result: 在模拟和真实ICU数据上表现优于随机生存森林和传统竞争风险模型。

Conclusion: FCRN在重症监护预后建模中更有效捕捉动态风险因素，适应不规则和不完整数据。

Abstract: We introduce the Functional Competing Risk Net (FCRN), a unified
deep-learning framework for discrete-time survival analysis under competing
risks, which seamlessly integrates functional covariates and handles missing
data within an end-to-end model. By combining a micro-network Basis Layer for
functional data representation with a gradient-based imputation module, FCRN
simultaneously learns to impute missing values and predict event-specific
hazards. Evaluated on multiple simulated datasets and a real-world ICU case
study using the MIMIC-IV and Cleveland Clinic datasets, FCRN demonstrates
substantial improvements in prediction accuracy over random survival forests
and traditional competing risks models. This approach advances prognostic
modeling in critical care by more effectively capturing dynamic risk factors
and static predictors while accommodating irregular and incomplete data.

Motivation: 解决机械取栓（MT）中自主导航的复杂性和泛化性问题。

Method: 使用TD-MPC2算法训练单一RL代理，在10个真实患者血管中进行多任务学习。

Result: TD-MPC2在成功率（65% vs 37%）和路径比上显著优于SAC，但耗时更长。

Conclusion: 世界模型在自主血管内导航中具有潜力，为未来AI驱动的机器人干预研究奠定基础。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical
challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise,
real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have
demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current
methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures
and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular
navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL
agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient
vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft
Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly
outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate
compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2
exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success
rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world
models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation
for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了使用混合高斯先验的变分自编码器（VAE-MoG）在GW150914引力波数据上的潜在空间表现，发现尽管模型能准确重构信号，但潜在空间存在不匹配。

Motivation: 研究目的是评估VAE-MoG模型在引力波数据中捕获潜在结构的能力，并验证其潜在空间的可靠性。

Method: 使用哈密顿蒙特卡洛（HMC）从干净输入中抽取后验样本，并与噪声数据编码器的输出进行比较。

Result: 模型能准确重构信号，但潜在空间存在明显不匹配，表明强去噪性能不一定代表潜在表示可靠。

Conclusion: 强调了在评估生成模型时使用基于后验验证的重要性。

Abstract: In this work, we explore the latent space of a denoising variational
autoencoder with a mixture-of-Gaussians prior (VAE-MoG), trained on
gravitational wave data from event GW150914. To evaluate how well the model
captures the underlying structure, we use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to draw
posterior samples conditioned on clean inputs, and compare them to the
encoder's outputs from noisy data. Although the model reconstructs signals
accurately, statistical comparisons reveal a clear mismatch in the latent
space. This shows that strong denoising performance doesn't necessarily mean
the latent representations are reliable highlighting the importance of using
posterior-based validation when evaluating generative models.

Conclusion: Mixsemble是一种适用于非专家用户的实用替代方案，尤其在真实数据结构未知时。

Abstract: This paper introduces mixsemble, an ensemble method that adapts the
Dawid-Skene model to aggregate predictions from multiple model-based clustering
algorithms. Unlike traditional crowdsourcing, which relies on human labels, the
framework models the outputs of clustering algorithms as noisy annotations.
Experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets show that, although the
mixsemble is not always the single top performer, it consistently approaches
the best result and avoids poor outcomes. This robustness makes it a practical
alternative when the true data structure is unknown, especially for non-expert
users.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决方程发现中模型在特定数据集上过拟合而无法泛化到不同操作条件的问题。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架下的贝叶斯RVM，同时识别多个数据集中的参数，共享模型参数但保留任务特定的噪声特性。

Result: MTL-RVM方法在弱和中等激励下改善了参数恢复，同时在高激励下保持良好性能。

Conclusion: 多任务贝叶斯推断可以减轻过拟合，提升方程发现中的泛化能力，适用于结构健康监测等场景。

Abstract: Equation discovery provides a grey-box approach to system identification by
uncovering governing dynamics directly from observed data. However, a
persistent challenge lies in ensuring that identified models generalise across
operating conditions rather than over-fitting to specific datasets. This work
investigates this issue by applying a Bayesian relevance vector machine (RVM)
within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework for simultaneous parameter
identification across multiple datasets. In this formulation, responses from
the same structure under different excitation levels are treated as related
tasks that share model parameters but retain task-specific noise
characteristics. A simulated single degree-of-freedom oscillator with linear
and cubic stiffness provided the case study, with datasets generated under
three excitation regimes. Standard single-task RVM models were able to
reproduce system responses but often failed to recover the true governing terms
when excitations insufficiently stimulated non-linear dynamics. By contrast,
the MTL-RVM combined information across tasks, improving parameter recovery for
weakly and moderately excited datasets, while maintaining strong performance
under high excitation. These findings demonstrate that multi-task Bayesian
inference can mitigate over-fitting and promote generalisation in equation
discovery. The approach is particularly relevant to structural health
monitoring, where varying load conditions reveal complementary aspects of
system physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对称处理回报和成本信号，忽视了其内在不对称性，导致约束满足不可靠。

Method: 提出B2R框架，重新定义成本信号为边界约束，结合旋转位置编码增强安全区域探索。

Result: 在38个安全关键任务中，B2R在35个任务中满足安全约束，且奖励性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: B2R解决了对称条件处理的局限性，为序列模型在安全强化学习中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning aims to learn policies that satisfy
predefined safety constraints from static datasets. Existing
sequence-model-based methods condition action generation on symmetric input
tokens for return-to-go and cost-to-go, neglecting their intrinsic asymmetry:
return-to-go (RTG) serves as a flexible performance target, while cost-to-go
(CTG) should represent a rigid safety boundary. This symmetric conditioning
leads to unreliable constraint satisfaction, especially when encountering
out-of-distribution cost trajectories. To address this, we propose
Boundary-to-Region (B2R), a framework that enables asymmetric conditioning
through cost signal realignment . B2R redefines CTG as a boundary constraint
under a fixed safety budget, unifying the cost distribution of all feasible
trajectories while preserving reward structures. Combined with rotary
positional embeddings , it enhances exploration within the safe region.
Experimental results show that B2R satisfies safety constraints in 35 out of 38
safety-critical tasks while achieving superior reward performance over baseline
methods. This work highlights the limitations of symmetric token conditioning
and establishes a new theoretical and practical approach for applying sequence
models to safe RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/HuikangSu/B2R.

TL;DR: FlashOmni是一个统一的稀疏注意力引擎，兼容任意DiT架构，通过标准化稀疏策略表示和优化稀疏GEMMs，显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态DiTs在视觉合成中表现出色，但计算需求高，现有稀疏加速方法因多样化稀疏模式需要定制内核，限制了通用性。

Method: 提出FlashOmni，引入灵活稀疏符号标准化稀疏策略表示，设计优化稀疏GEMMs消除冗余计算。

Result: 实验显示FlashOmni在注意力和GEMM-$Q$中实现近线性加速，GEMM-$O$加速2.5-3.8倍，Hunyuan模型端到端加速1.5倍且视觉质量无损。

Conclusion: FlashOmni通过统一稀疏计算和优化GEMMs，有效解决了DiTs计算瓶颈，提升了效率和通用性。

Abstract: Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) demonstrate exceptional
capabilities in visual synthesis, yet their deployment remains constrained by
substantial computational demands. To alleviate this bottleneck, many
sparsity-based acceleration methods have been proposed. However, their diverse
sparsity patterns often require customized kernels for high-performance
inference, limiting universality. We propose FlashOmni, a unified sparse
attention engine compatible with arbitrary DiT architectures. FlashOmni
introduces flexible sparse symbols to standardize the representation of a wide
range of sparsity strategies, such as feature caching and block-sparse
skipping. This unified abstraction enables the execution of diverse sparse
computations within a single attention kernel. In addition, FlashOmni designs
optimized sparse GEMMs for attention blocks, leveraging sparse symbols to
eliminate redundant computations and further improve efficiency. Experiments
demonstrate that FlashOmni delivers near-linear, closely matching the sparsity
ratio speedup (1:1) in attention and GEMM-$Q$, and achieves
2.5$\times$-3.8$\times$ acceleration in GEMM-$O$ (max peaking at about 87.5% of
the theoretical limit). Applied with a multi-granularity sparsity strategy, it
enables the Hunyuan model (33K) to achieve about 1.5$\times$ end-to-end
acceleration without degrading visual quality.

Motivation: 研究发现LoRA中的A矩阵相似性源于初始化而非知识共享，B矩阵在知识编码中更关键。

Method: 提出ALoRA（共享B的多A设计）和Fed-ALoRA（联邦学习中共享B的分解策略）。

Result: 在常识推理、数学推理和多任务NLP数据集上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ALoRA和Fed-ALoRA在多任务和联邦学习中具有高效性和普适性。

Abstract: Large language models are often adapted using parameter-efficient techniques
such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), formulated as $y = W_0x + BAx$, where $W_0$
is the pre-trained parameters and $x$ is the input to the adapted layer. While
multi-adapter extensions often employ multiple LoRAs, prior studies suggest
that the inner $A$ matrices are highly similar during training and thus
suitable for sharing. We revisit this phenomenon and find that this similarity
is largely attributable to the identical initialization rather than shared
knowledge, with $B$ playing a more critical role in knowledge encoding and
transfer. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textbf{ALoRA}, an asymmetric
multi-LoRA design with multiple $A$ matrices and a single shared $B$ in
multi-task fine-tuning, and \textbf{Fed-ALoRA}, which shares $B$ across clients
in federated fine-tuning under both homogeneous and heterogeneous settings,
through a novel matrix decomposition strategy to accommodate heterogeneous
ranks across clients. Experiments on commonsense reasoning, math reasoning,
multi-task NLP dataset, and federated NLP dataset demonstrate that our methods
achieve more balanced performance across tasks with comparable or superior
average accuracy relative to existing multi-LoRA approaches. Codes are

TL;DR: HIA是一种针对TGNN的新型黑盒攻击框架，通过识别关键节点和混合扰动策略，显著降低模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有攻击方法对时空动态图的攻击效果有限，且容易被检测，需要更隐蔽且高效的攻击方法。

Method: HIA利用数据驱动的替代模型识别关键节点，并采用混合扰动策略（边注入和删除）进行攻击。

Result: 在五个真实数据集和四种TGNN架构上，HIA使链接预测任务的MRR下降高达35.55%。

Conclusion: HIA揭示了当前STDG模型的脆弱性，强调了开发兼顾结构和时间动态的防御方法的紧迫性。

Abstract: Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have become indispensable for
analyzing dynamic graphs in critical applications such as social networks,
communication systems, and financial networks. However, the robustness of TGNNs
against adversarial attacks, particularly sophisticated attacks that exploit
the temporal dimension, remains a significant challenge. Existing attack
methods for Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Graphs (STDGs) often rely on simplistic,
easily detectable perturbations (e.g., random edge additions/deletions) and
fail to strategically target the most influential nodes and edges for maximum
impact. We introduce the High Impact Attack (HIA), a novel restricted black-box
attack framework specifically designed to overcome these limitations and expose
critical vulnerabilities in TGNNs. HIA leverages a data-driven surrogate model
to identify structurally important nodes (central to network connectivity) and
dynamically important nodes (critical for the graph's temporal evolution). It
then employs a hybrid perturbation strategy, combining strategic edge injection
(to create misleading connections) and targeted edge deletion (to disrupt
essential pathways), maximizing TGNN performance degradation. Importantly, HIA
minimizes the number of perturbations to enhance stealth, making it more
challenging to detect. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets
and four representative TGNN architectures (TGN, JODIE, DySAT, and TGAT)
demonstrate that HIA significantly reduces TGNN accuracy on the link prediction
task, achieving up to a 35.55% decrease in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) - a
substantial improvement over state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in current STDG models and underscore the
urgent need for robust defenses that account for both structural and temporal
dynamics.

Motivation: 预训练策略在微调时容易失去多样性，导致输出单一且易被利用。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了一种新的目标函数。

Method: 通过vine采样收集策略轨迹，并修改优势函数以适应新目标。改进的PPO算法用于优化polychromic objective。

Result: 在BabyAI、Minigrid和Algorithmic Creativity等任务中，方法显著提高了成功率，并在pass@k实验中表现出更高的覆盖率。

Conclusion: polychromic objective能有效维持策略多样性，提升探索能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) is a dominant paradigm for
improving pretrained policies for downstream tasks. These pretrained policies,
trained on large datasets, produce generations with a broad range of promising
but unrefined behaviors. Often, a critical failure mode of RLFT arises when
policies lose this diversity and collapse into a handful of easily exploitable
outputs. This convergence hinders exploration, which is essential for expanding
the capabilities of the pretrained policy and for amplifying the benefits of
test-time compute scaling. To address this, we introduce an objective for
policy gradient methods that explicitly enforces the exploration and refinement
of diverse generations, which we call a polychromic objective. We then show how
proximal policy optimization (PPO) can be adapted to optimize this objective.
Our method (1) employs vine sampling to collect on-policy rollouts and (2)
modifies the advantage function to reflect the advantage under our new
objective. Experiments on BabyAI, Minigrid, and Algorithmic Creativity show
that our method improves success rates by reliably solving a larger set of
environment configurations and generalizes better under large perturbations.
Moreover, when given multiple attempts in pass@$k$ experiments, the policy
achieves substantially higher coverage, demonstrating its ability to maintain
and exploit a diverse repertoire of strategies.

Conclusion: 新方法为广告预算控制提供了可扩展且可靠的解决方案，尤其适合小预算广告。

Abstract: Budget pacing is critical in online advertising to align spend with campaign
goals under dynamic auctions. Existing pacing methods often rely on ad-hoc
parameter tuning, which can be unstable and inefficient. We propose a
principled controller that combines bucketized hysteresis with proportional
feedback to provide stable and adaptive spend control. Our method provides a
framework and analysis for parameter selection that enables accurate tracking
of desired spend rates across campaigns. Experiments in real-world auctions
demonstrate significant improvements in pacing accuracy and delivery
consistency, reducing pacing error by 13% and $\lambda$-volatility by 54%
compared to baseline method. By bridging control theory with advertising
systems, our approach offers a scalable and reliable solution for budget
pacing, with particular benefits for small-budget campaigns.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LPM的新方法，通过监控学习进度来引导探索，解决了传统内在奖励方法在噪声环境中的低效问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统内在奖励方法在存在不可学习噪声（如noisy-TV）的环境中容易陷入局部最优，且计算成本高。受人类探索时监控进步的启发，作者提出了LPM方法。

Method: LPM通过双网络设计，利用误差模型预测动态模型的预期误差，并用当前与先前迭代的误差差作为内在奖励，引导代理关注可学习的过渡。

Result: 实验表明，LPM在MNIST、3D迷宫和Atari环境中比基线方法收敛更快，探索更多状态，并获得更高的外在奖励。

Conclusion: LPM是一种概念简单但有效的方法，标志着噪声鲁棒探索的范式转变。

Abstract: When there exists an unlearnable source of randomness (noisy-TV) in the
environment, a naively intrinsic reward driven exploring agent gets stuck at
that source of randomness and fails at exploration. Intrinsic reward based on
uncertainty estimation or distribution similarity, while eventually escapes
noisy-TVs as time unfolds, suffers from poor sample efficiency and high
computational cost. Inspired by recent findings from neuroscience that humans
monitor their improvements during exploration, we propose a novel method for
intrinsically-motivated exploration, named Learning Progress Monitoring (LPM).
During exploration, LPM rewards model improvements instead of prediction error
or novelty, effectively rewards the agent for observing learnable transitions
rather than the unlearnable transitions. We introduce a dual-network design
that uses an error model to predict the expected prediction error of the
dynamics model in its previous iteration, and use the difference between the
model errors of the current iteration and previous iteration to guide
exploration. We theoretically show that the intrinsic reward of LPM is
zero-equivariant and a monotone indicator of Information Gain (IG), and that
the error model is necessary to achieve monotonicity correspondence with IG. We
empirically compared LPM against state-of-the-art baselines in noisy
environments based on MNIST, 3D maze with 160x120 RGB inputs, and Atari.
Results show that LPM's intrinsic reward converges faster, explores more states
in the maze experiment, and achieves higher extrinsic reward in Atari. This
conceptually simple approach marks a shift-of-paradigm of noise-robust
exploration. For code to reproduce our experiments, see

Motivation: HMM在生成任务中表现强大，但计算和数据传输密集，性能受限。Norm-Q旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出归一化量化感知的期望最大化过程，用于概率模型训练。

Result: Norm-Q在压缩率和分数损失上优于传统方法，可将HMM压缩至8位无损失或3位可接受损失，压缩率达99%。

Conclusion: Norm-Q高效压缩HMM，适用于定制硬件部署，代码已开源。

Abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMM) are commonly used in generation tasks and have
demonstrated strong capabilities in neuro-symbolic applications for the Markov
property. These applications leverage the strengths of neural networks and
symbolic reasoning to create robust and interpretable AI systems. However, they
may inherit and amplify the shortcomings of both approaches. Both components
require dense computation and data transfer, and their communication further
hinders performance. This paper proposes Norm-Q, a normalized linear
quantization approach for compressing probabilistic symbolic models, such as
HMMs. We reduce the bit width of the data with minimal impact, thereby
alleviating memory and bandwidth stress and enabling deployment on potential
custom hardware. Our method introduces a normalized quantization-aware
expectation maximization process for probabilistic model training. The
experimental results show that Norm-Q achieves a higher compression rate with
reasonable score loss compared to traditional quantization methods. In the case
of the constrained generation task of large language models, we successfully
quantize an HMM of 4096 hidden states to 8 bits without loss and, at most, 3
bits with acceptable loss. Notably, the Norm-Q method can achieve a compression
rate of 99% for the weights of the HMM. The code is open source at

Result: 在多个标准数据集上，TS-JEPA在分类和预测任务中达到或超越当前最优基线。

Conclusion: TS-JEPA为时间序列基础模型的开发提供了稳健的通用表示学习方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning has seen great success recently in unsupervised
representation learning, enabling breakthroughs in natural language and image
processing. However, these methods often rely on autoregressive and masked
modeling, which aim to reproduce masked information in the input, which can be
vulnerable to the presence of noise or confounding variables. To address this
problem, Joint-Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPA) has been introduced
with the aim to perform self-supervised learning in the latent space. To
leverage these advancements in the domain of time series, we introduce Time
Series JEPA (TS-JEPA), an architecture specifically adapted for time series
representation learning. We validate TS-JEPA on both classification and
forecasting, showing that it can match or surpass current state-of-the-art
baselines on different standard datasets. Notably, our approach demonstrates a
strong performance balance across diverse tasks, indicating its potential as a
robust foundation for learning general representations. Thus, this work lays
the groundwork for developing future time series foundation models based on
Joint Embedding.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies that can perform many tasks typically require
extensive expert data or simulations for training. In this work, we propose a
novel Data-Efficient multitask DAgger framework that distills a single
multitask policy from multiple task-specific expert policies. Our approach
significantly increases the overall task success rate by actively focusing on
tasks where the multitask policy underperforms. The core of our method is a
performance-aware scheduling strategy that tracks how much each task's learning
process benefits from the amount of data, using a Kalman filter-based estimator
to robustly decide how to allocate additional demonstrations across tasks. We
validate our approach on MetaWorld, as well as a suite of diverse
drawer-opening tasks in IsaacLab. The resulting policy attains high performance
across all tasks while using substantially fewer expert demonstrations, and the
visual policy learned with our method in simulation shows better performance
than naive DAgger and Behavior Cloning when transferring zero-shot to a real
robot without using real data.

Method: 引入基于鲁棒性的非一致性评分，将平滑CP层嵌入训练中，并使用新的损失函数同时优化推理准确性和CP预测集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法减少了预测的不确定性（高覆盖率且减小预测集大小），并提高了准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法在基准时间序列任务中优于现有基线，提供了统计保证的STL公式。

Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) inference seeks to extract human-interpretable
rules from time-series data, but existing methods lack formal confidence
guarantees for the inferred rules. Conformal prediction (CP) is a technique
that can provide statistical correctness guarantees, but is typically applied
as a post-training wrapper without improving model learning. Instead, we
introduce an end-to-end differentiable CP framework for STL inference that
enhances both reliability and interpretability of the resulting formulas. We
introduce a robustness-based nonconformity score, embed a smooth CP layer
directly into training, and employ a new loss function that simultaneously
optimizes inference accuracy and CP prediction sets with a single term.
Following training, an exact CP procedure delivers statistical guarantees for
the learned STL formulas. Experiments on benchmark time-series tasks show that
our approach reduces uncertainty in predictions (i.e., it achieves high
coverage while reducing prediction set size), and improves accuracy (i.e., the
number of misclassifications when using a fixed threshold) over
state-of-the-art baselines.

*Hui Ji,Wei Gao,Pengfei Zhou*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: P2Es是一种创新的基于PPG信号生成12导联ECG的框架，通过频域模糊和时间噪声干扰模拟真实信号失真，并利用KNN聚类和对比学习实现人口统计特异性ECG转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有12导联ECG系统笨重，不适合持续监测，而PPG方法无法重建多导联ECG，缺乏导联间约束和时空依赖性建模。

Method: P2Es框架包含前向过程的频域模糊和时间噪声干扰，反向过程的时间多尺度生成和频域去模糊，以及基于KNN聚类和对比学习的亲和矩阵分配。

Result: 实验表明，P2Es在12导联ECG重建中优于基线模型。

Conclusion: P2Es通过创新方法成功解决了PPG到ECG的转换问题，具有临床有效性。

Abstract: The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is the gold standard for cardiovascular
monitoring, offering superior diagnostic granularity and specificity compared
to photoplethysmography (PPG). However, existing 12-lead ECG systems rely on
cumbersome multi-electrode setups, limiting sustained monitoring in ambulatory
settings, while current PPG-based methods fail to reconstruct multi-lead ECG
due to the absence of inter-lead constraints and insufficient modeling of
spatial-temporal dependencies across leads. To bridge this gap, we introduce
P2Es, an innovative demographic-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
clinically valid 12-lead ECG from PPG signals via three key innovations.
Specifically, in the forward process, we introduce frequency-domain blurring
followed by temporal noise interference to simulate real-world signal
distortions. In the reverse process, we design a temporal multi-scale
generation module followed by frequency deblurring. In particular, we leverage
KNN-based clustering combined with contrastive learning to assign affinity
matrices for the reverse process, enabling demographic-specific ECG
translation. Extensive experimental results show that P2Es outperforms baseline
models in 12-lead ECG reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于磁盘的ANNS方法存在I/O路径长、存储粒度不匹配和高内存开销等问题，限制了大规模向量搜索的可扩展性。

Method: PageANN引入了页节点图结构，将逻辑节点与物理SSD页对齐，并结合轻量级索引和内存-磁盘数据协调分配策略。

Result: 实验表明，PageANN在吞吐量和延迟方面显著优于现有方法，同时保持高召回率。

Conclusion: PageANN通过优化存储和内存管理，为大规模向量搜索提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS), as the core of vector databases
(VectorDBs), has become widely used in modern AI and ML systems, powering
applications from information retrieval to bio-informatics. While graph-based
ANNS methods achieve high query efficiency, their scalability is constrained by
the available host memory. Recent disk-based ANNS approaches mitigate memory
usage by offloading data to Solid-State Drives (SSDs). However, they still
suffer from issues such as long I/O traversal path, misalignment with storage
I/O granularity, and high in-memory indexing overhead, leading to significant
I/O latency and ultimately limiting scalability for large-scale vector search.
  In this paper, we propose PageANN, a disk-based approximate nearest neighbor
search (ANNS) framework designed for high performance and scalability. PageANN
introduces a page-node graph structure that aligns logical graph nodes with
physical SSD pages, thereby shortening I/O traversal paths and reducing I/O
operations. Specifically, similar vectors are clustered into page nodes, and a
co-designed disk data layout leverages this structure with a merging technique
to store only representative vectors and topology information, avoiding
unnecessary reads. To further improve efficiency, we design a memory management
strategy that combines lightweight indexing with coordinated memory-disk data
allocation, maximizing host memory utilization while minimizing query latency
and storage overhead. Experimental results show that PageANN significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) disk-based ANNS methods, achieving
1.85x-10.83x higher throughput and 51.7%-91.9% lower latency across different
datasets and memory budgets, while maintaining comparable high recall accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子基础模型在OOD样本上的不可靠性限制了其在药物发现等高风险领域的应用。

Method: 将OOD检测问题转化为对ID和OOD样本间OOD亲和度的偏好优化，通过成对学习目标实现。

Result: 在五个真实分子数据集上，Mole-PAIR显著提升了OOD检测能力，AUROC最高提升45.8%。

Conclusion: Mole-PAIR有效解决了分子基础模型的化学幻觉问题，提升了其在OOD数据上的可靠性。

Abstract: Molecular foundation models are rapidly advancing scientific discovery, but
their unreliability on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples severely limits their
application in high-stakes domains such as drug discovery and protein design. A
critical failure mode is chemical hallucination, where models make
high-confidence yet entirely incorrect predictions for unknown molecules. To
address this challenge, we introduce Molecular Preference-Aligned Instance
Ranking (Mole-PAIR), a simple, plug-and-play module that can be flexibly
integrated with existing foundation models to improve their reliability on OOD
data through cost-effective post-training. Specifically, our method formulates
the OOD detection problem as a preference optimization over the estimated OOD
affinity between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples, achieving this goal
through a pairwise learning objective. We show that this objective essentially
optimizes AUROC, which measures how consistently ID and OOD samples are ranked
by the model. Extensive experiments across five real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the OOD detection
capabilities of existing molecular foundation models, achieving up to 45.8%,
43.9%, and 24.3% improvements in AUROC under distribution shifts of size,
scaffold, and assay, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模拟和混合信号（AMS）集成电路设计中的晶体管尺寸设计过程需要大量人工，机器学习方法虽能减少复杂性但仍面临迭代次数多和知识不足的挑战。

Method: EEsizer利用提示工程和链式推理，通过迭代探索设计方向、评估性能和优化解决方案，结合LLM和电路模拟器实现自动化设计。

Conclusion: EEsizer展示了LLM在自动化AMS电路设计中的潜力，能够高效完成晶体管尺寸优化，减少人工干预。

Abstract: The design of Analog and Mixed-Signal (AMS) integrated circuits (ICs) often
involves significant manual effort, especially during the transistor sizing
process. While Machine Learning techniques in Electronic Design Automation
(EDA) have shown promise in reducing complexity and minimizing human
intervention, they still face challenges such as numerous iterations and a lack
of knowledge about AMS circuit design. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs)
have demonstrated significant potential across various fields, showing a
certain level of knowledge in circuit design and indicating their potential to
automate the transistor sizing process. In this work, we propose EEsizer, an
LLM-based AI agent that integrates large language models with circuit
simulators and custom data analysis functions, enabling fully automated,
closed-loop transistor sizing without relying on external knowledge. By
employing prompt engineering and Chain-of-Thought reasoning, the agent
iteratively explores design directions, evaluates performance, and refines
solutions with minimal human intervention. We first benchmarked 8 LLMs on six
basic circuits and selected three high-performing models to optimize a
20-transistor CMOS operational amplifier, targeting multiple performance
metrics, including rail-to-rail operation from 180 nm to 90 nm technology
nodes. Notably, OpenAI o3 successfully achieved the user-intended target at 90
nm across three different test groups, with a maximum of 20 iterations,
demonstrating adaptability and robustness at advanced nodes. To assess design
robustness, we manually designed a bias circuit and performed a variation
analysis using Gaussian-distributed variations on transistor dimensions and
threshold voltages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OT-FM方法在批量较大时计算成本过高，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 利用半离散最优传输（SD-OT）和随机梯度下降（SGD）估计对偶势向量，结合最大内积搜索（MIPS）匹配噪声与数据点。

Result: SD-FM在多个数据集和任务上均优于FM和OT-FM，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: SD-FM是一种高效且性能优越的流匹配方法，适用于各种生成任务。

Abstract: Flow models parameterized as time-dependent velocity fields can generate data
from noise by integrating an ODE. These models are often trained using flow
matching, i.e. by sampling random pairs of noise and target points
$(\mathbf{x}_0,\mathbf{x}_1)$ and ensuring that the velocity field is aligned,
on average, with $\mathbf{x}_1-\mathbf{x}_0$ when evaluated along a segment
linking $\mathbf{x}_0$ to $\mathbf{x}_1$. While these pairs are sampled
independently by default, they can also be selected more carefully by matching
batches of $n$ noise to $n$ target points using an optimal transport (OT)
solver. Although promising in theory, the OT flow matching (OT-FM) approach is
not widely used in practice. Zhang et al. (2025) pointed out recently that
OT-FM truly starts paying off when the batch size $n$ grows significantly,
which only a multi-GPU implementation of the Sinkhorn algorithm can handle.
Unfortunately, the costs of running Sinkhorn can quickly balloon, requiring
$O(n^2/\varepsilon^2)$ operations for every $n$ pairs used to fit the velocity
field, where $\varepsilon$ is a regularization parameter that should be
typically small to yield better results. To fulfill the theoretical promises of
OT-FM, we propose to move away from batch-OT and rely instead on a semidiscrete
formulation that leverages the fact that the target dataset distribution is
usually of finite size $N$. The SD-OT problem is solved by estimating a dual
potential vector using SGD; using that vector, freshly sampled noise vectors at
train time can then be matched with data points at the cost of a maximum inner
product search (MIPS). Semidiscrete FM (SD-FM) removes the quadratic dependency
on $n/\varepsilon$ that bottlenecks OT-FM. SD-FM beats both FM and OT-FM on all
training metrics and inference budget constraints, across multiple datasets, on
unconditional/conditional generation, or when using mean-flow models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果推理框架的LLM路由器训练方法，结合黄金标准和偏好数据，以提高路由准确性和成本效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在需要大量人机交互的语言任务中，为每个查询部署单一最佳模型成本高昂。现有监督数据稀缺且偏好数据存在偏差，需要一种方法整合两种数据并纠正偏差。

Method: 将LLM路由器训练问题转化为因果推理框架，将响应评估机制视为治疗分配，开发了纠正偏好数据偏差的集成训练框架。

Result: 数值实验表明，该方法提高了路由准确性，优化了成本与质量之间的权衡。

Conclusion: 提出的因果路由训练框架有效整合了不同数据源，纠正了偏差，提升了路由的鲁棒性和效率。

Abstract: In language tasks that require extensive human--model interaction, deploying
a single "best" model for every query can be expensive. To reduce inference
cost while preserving the quality of the responses, a large language model
(LLM) router selects the most appropriate model from a pool of candidates for
each query. A central challenge to training a high-quality router is the
scarcity of reliable supervision. Gold-standard data (e.g., expert-verified
labels or rubric-based scores) provide accurate quality evaluations of LLM
responses but are costly and difficult to scale. In contrast, preference-based
data, collected via crowdsourcing or LLM-as-a-judge systems, are cheaper and
more scalable, yet often biased in reflecting the true quality of responses. We
cast the problem of LLM router training with combined gold-standard and
preference-based data into a causal inference framework by viewing the response
evaluation mechanism as the treatment assignment. This perspective further
reveals that the bias in preference-based data corresponds to the well-known
causal estimand: the conditional average treatment effect. Based on this new
perspective, we develop an integrative causal router training framework that
corrects preference-data bias, address imbalances between two data sources, and
improve routing robustness and efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate
that our approach delivers more accurate routing and improves the trade-off
between cost and quality.

Result: 在碳捕获分子结构发现中，主动学习方法将高质量候选者数量从281提升至604（每1000个候选者）。

Conclusion: 主动学习能有效防止生成模型资源浪费和性能衰减，显著提升高质量候选者数量。

Abstract: Generative AI poses both opportunities and risks for solving inverse design
problems in the sciences. Generative tools provide the ability to expand and
refine a search space autonomously, but do so at the cost of exploring
low-quality regions until sufficiently fine tuned. Here, we propose a queue
prioritization algorithm that combines generative modeling and active learning
in the context of a distributed workflow for exploring complex design spaces.
We find that incorporating an active learning model to prioritize top design
candidates can prevent a generative AI workflow from expending resources on
nonsensical candidates and halt potential generative model decay. For an
existing generative AI workflow for discovering novel molecular structure
candidates for carbon capture, our active learning approach significantly
increases the number of high-quality candidates identified by the generative
model. We find that, out of 1000 novel candidates, our workflow without active
learning can generate an average of 281 high-performing candidates, while our
proposed prioritization with active learning can generate an average 604
high-performing candidates.

Conclusion: FedIF是实际部署中高效、鲁棒且可扩展的联邦学习聚合方法。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces persistent robustness challenges due to non-IID
data distributions and adversarial client behavior. A promising mitigation
strategy is contribution evaluation, which enables adaptive aggregation by
quantifying each client's utility to the global model. However,
state-of-the-art Shapley-value-based approaches incur high computational
overhead due to repeated model reweighting and inference, which limits their
scalability. We propose FedIF, a novel FL aggregation framework that leverages
trajectory-based influence estimation to efficiently compute client
contributions. FedIF adapts decentralized FL by introducing normalized and
smoothed influence scores computed from lightweight gradient operations on
client updates and a public validation set. Theoretical analysis demonstrates
that FedIF yields a tighter bound on one-step global loss change under noisy
conditions. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and Fashion-MNIST show that FedIF
achieves robustness comparable to or exceeding SV-based methods in the presence
of label noise, gradient noise, and adversarial samples, while reducing
aggregation overhead by up to 450x. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness
of FedIF's design choices, including local weight normalization and influence
smoothing. Our results establish FedIF as a practical, theoretically grounded,
and scalable alternative to Shapley-value-based approaches for efficient and
robust FL in real-world deployments.

Motivation: ICRL在适应分布外任务时缺乏安全性保障，需要一种方法在无参数更新的情况下同时优化奖励和成本。

Method: 在ICRL框架中引入约束马尔可夫决策过程，通过扩展策略神经网络的输入（如历史经验）实现安全适应。

Result: 代理能够根据成本预算主动调整行为：高预算时更激进，低预算时更保守。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了ICRL的安全适应，且行为可随成本预算灵活调整。

Abstract: In-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) is an emerging RL paradigm where the
agent, after some pretraining procedure, is able to adapt to
out-of-distribution test tasks without any parameter updates. The agent
achieves this by continually expanding the input (i.e., the context) to its
policy neural networks. For example, the input could be all the history
experience that the agent has access to until the current time step. The
agent's performance improves as the input grows, without any parameter updates.
In this work, we propose the first method that promotes the safety of ICRL's
adaptation process in the framework of constrained Markov Decision Processes.
In other words, during the parameter-update-free adaptation process, the agent
not only maximizes the reward but also minimizes an additional cost function.
We also demonstrate that our agent actively reacts to the threshold (i.e.,
budget) of the cost tolerance. With a higher cost budget, the agent behaves
more aggressively, and with a lower cost budget, the agent behaves more
conservatively.

Result: ML和RL将经典方法转化为更适用于现实优化的框架。

Conclusion: ML和RL显著提升了BBO的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Black-box optimization (BBO) addresses problems where objectives are
accessible only through costly queries without gradients or explicit structure.
Classical derivative-free methods -- line search, direct search, and
model-based solvers such as Bayesian optimization -- form the backbone of BBO,
yet often struggle in high-dimensional, noisy, or mixed-integer settings.
  Recent advances use machine learning (ML) and reinforcement learning (RL) to
enhance BBO: ML provides expressive surrogates, adaptive updates, meta-learning
portfolios, and generative models, while RL enables dynamic operator
configuration, robustness, and meta-optimization across tasks.
  This paper surveys these developments, covering representative algorithms
such as NNs with the modular model-based optimization framework (mlrMBO),
zeroth-order adaptive momentum methods (ZO-AdaMM), automated BBO (ABBO),
distributed block-wise optimization (DiBB), partition-based Bayesian
optimization (SPBOpt), the transformer-based optimizer (B2Opt),
diffusion-model-based BBO, surrogate-assisted RL for differential evolution
(Surr-RLDE), robust BBO (RBO), coordinate-ascent model-based optimization with
relative entropy (CAS-MORE), log-barrier stochastic gradient descent (LB-SGD),
policy improvement with black-box (PIBB), and offline Q-learning with Mamba
backbones (Q-Mamba).
  We also review benchmark efforts such as the NeurIPS 2020 BBO Challenge and
the MetaBox framework. Overall, we highlight how ML and RL transform classical
inexact solvers into more scalable, robust, and adaptive frameworks for
real-world optimization.

Result: 二元化提高了特征的单一语义性和可解释性，但增加了重构误差和超高频不可解释特征。频率调整后，连续稀疏编码器的可解释性略优于二元化方法。

Conclusion: 二元化改善了特征的可解释性，但可能无法完全消除神经激活的多义性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are used to decompose neural network activations
into sparsely activating features, but many SAE features are only interpretable
at high activation strengths. To address this issue we propose to use binary
sparse autoencoders (BAEs) and binary transcoders (BTCs), which constrain all
activations to be zero or one. We find that binarisation significantly improves
the interpretability and monosemanticity of the discovered features, while
increasing reconstruction error. By eliminating the distinction between high
and low activation strengths, we prevent uninterpretable information from being
smuggled in through the continuous variation in feature activations. However,
we also find that binarisation increases the number of uninterpretable
ultra-high frequency features, and when interpretability scores are
frequency-adjusted, the scores for continuous sparse coders are slightly better
than those of binary ones. This suggests that polysemanticity may be an
ineliminable property of neural activations.

Result: 在多种模型（MLP、CNN、Transformer等）中，剪枝后性能与原密集网络相当。

Conclusion: EMP提供了一种通用且高效的剪枝方法，适用于多种评分标准和模型结构。

Abstract: We introduce Effective Model Pruning (EMP), a context-agnostic,
parameter-free rule addressing a fundamental question about pruning: how many
entries to keep. EMP does not prescribe how to score the parameters or prune
the models; instead, it supplies a universal adaptive threshold that can be
applied to any pruning criterion: weight magnitude, attention score, KAN
importance score, or even feature-level signals such as image pixel, and used
on structural parts or weights of the models. Given any score vector s, EMP
maps s to a built-in effective number N_eff which is inspired by the Inverse
Simpson index of contributors. Retaining the N_eff highest scoring entries and
zeroing the remainder yields sparse models with performance comparable to the
original dense networks across MLPs, CNNs, Transformers/LLMs, and KAN, in our
experiments. By leveraging the geometry of the simplex, we derive a tight lower
bound on the preserved mass s_eff (the sum of retained scores) over the
corresponding ordered probability simplex associated with the score vector s.
We further verify the effectiveness of N_eff by pruning the model with a scaled
threshold \b{eta}*N_eff across a variety of criteria and models. Experiments
suggest that the default \b{eta} = 1 yields a robust threshold for model
pruning while \b{eta} not equal to 1 still serves as an optional adjustment to
meet specific sparsity requirements.

Conclusion: T-BiGAN能有效检测细微频率和电压偏差，适用于实时广域监测。

Abstract: Ensuring power grid resilience requires the timely and unsupervised detection
of anomalies in synchrophasor data streams. We introduce T-BiGAN, a novel
framework that integrates window-attention Transformers within a bidirectional
Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN) to address this challenge. Its
self-attention encoder-decoder architecture captures complex spatio-temporal
dependencies across the grid, while a joint discriminator enforces cycle
consistency to align the learned latent space with the true data distribution.
Anomalies are flagged in real-time using an adaptive score that combines
reconstruction error, latent space drift, and discriminator confidence.
Evaluated on a realistic hardware-in-the-loop PMU benchmark, T-BiGAN achieves
an ROC-AUC of 0.95 and an average precision of 0.996, significantly
outperforming leading supervised and unsupervised methods. It shows particular
strength in detecting subtle frequency and voltage deviations, demonstrating
its practical value for live, wide-area monitoring without relying on manually
labeled fault data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SVD压缩方法对所有层采用统一压缩比，忽略了LLM中不同层的信息密度差异，导致压缩效果不佳。

Method: 引入有效秩作为信息密度度量，通过拉格朗日乘子优化动态分配秩，并针对注意力层进行重新平衡。

Conclusion: D-Rank通过动态分配秩，显著提升了LLM压缩的性能和效率。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly scaled in size, bringing severe
memory and computational challenges that hinder their deployment. Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD)-based compression has emerged as an appealing
post-training compression technique for LLMs, yet most existing methods apply a
uniform compression ratio across all layers, implicitly assuming homogeneous
information included in various layers. This overlooks the substantial
intra-layer heterogeneity observed in LLMs, where middle layers tend to encode
richer information while early and late layers are more redundant. In this
work, we revisit the existing SVD-based compression method and propose D-Rank,
a framework with layer-wise balanced Dynamic Rank allocation for LLMs
compression. We first introduce effective rank as a principled metric to
measure the information density of weight matrices, and then allocate ranks via
a Lagrange multiplier-based optimization scheme to adaptively assign more
capacity to groups with higher information density under a fixed compression
ratio. Moreover, we rebalance the allocated ranks across attention layers to
account for their varying importance and extend D-Rank to latest LLMs with
grouped-query attention. Extensive experiments on various LLMs with different
scales across multiple compression ratios demonstrate that D-Rank consistently
outperforms SVD-LLM, ASVD, and Basis Sharing, achieving more than 15 lower
perplexity with LLaMA-3-8B model on C4 datasets at 20% compression ratio and up
to 5% higher zero-shot reasoning accuracy with LLaMA-7B model at 40%
compression ratio while achieving even higher throughput.

TL;DR: Swift是一种单步一致性模型，通过CRPS目标实现概率流模型的自动回归微调，显著提高了天气预测的效率和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在天气预测中具有物理基础，但传统方法依赖缓慢的迭代求解器，不适用于长期预测和校准需求。

Method: 引入Swift模型，通过单步一致性设计和CRPS目标实现高效的概率流模型微调。

Result: Swift在6小时预测中表现优异，稳定性长达75天，速度比现有扩散模型快39倍，且预测能力与数值模型相当。

Conclusion: Swift为从中期到季节尺度的集合预报提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a physically grounded framework for probabilistic
weather forecasting, but their typical reliance on slow, iterative solvers
during inference makes them impractical for subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S)
applications where long lead-times and domain-driven calibration are essential.
To address this, we introduce Swift, a single-step consistency model that, for
the first time, enables autoregressive finetuning of a probability flow model
with a continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) objective. This eliminates
the need for multi-model ensembling or parameter perturbations. Results show
that Swift produces skillful 6-hourly forecasts that remain stable for up to 75
days, running $39\times$ faster than state-of-the-art diffusion baselines while
achieving forecast skill competitive with the numerical-based, operational IFS
ENS. This marks a step toward efficient and reliable ensemble forecasting from
medium-range to seasonal-scales.

Motivation: 探讨预条件如何影响特征学习和泛化性能，填补其在期望风险中作用的研究空白。

Method: 通过将预条件器实例化为输入协方差矩阵的p次幂，并在单索引教师模型中分析其影响。

Result: 泛化性能中，指数p和教师与输入谱的对齐是关键因素；谱偏差与教师对齐时泛化显著提升。

Conclusion: 预条件器的谱偏差对特征学习有显著影响，且与教师谱对齐时能显著提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Preconditioning is widely used in machine learning to accelerate convergence
on the empirical risk, yet its role on the expected risk remains underexplored.
In this work, we investigate how preconditioning affects feature learning and
generalization performance. We first show that the input information available
to the model is conveyed solely through the Gram matrix defined by the
preconditioner's metric, thereby inducing a controllable spectral bias on
feature learning. Concretely, instantiating the preconditioner as the $p$-th
power of the input covariance matrix and within a single-index teacher model,
we prove that in generalization, the exponent $p$ and the alignment between the
teacher and the input spectrum are crucial factors. We further investigate how
the interplay between these factors influences feature learning from three
complementary perspectives: (i) Robustness to noise, (ii) Out-of-distribution
generalization, and (iii) Forward knowledge transfer. Our results indicate that
the learned feature representations closely mirror the spectral bias introduced
by the preconditioner -- favoring components that are emphasized and exhibiting
reduced sensitivity to those that are suppressed. Crucially, we demonstrate
that generalization is significantly enhanced when this spectral bias is
aligned with that of the teacher.

Motivation: 解决DeepONets和VIDON在传感器固定性、稀疏性及不确定性量化方面的不足。

Method: 结合集合变换器嵌入处理稀疏传感器位置，使用条件变分自编码器（cVAE）近似解算子的条件分布。

Result: 在确定性和随机PDE（如Navier-Stokes方程）上的实验验证了框架的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: UQ-SONet在保持预测精度的同时，提供了可靠的不确定性估计。

Abstract: Learning operators from data is central to scientific machine learning. While
DeepONets are widely used for their ability to handle complex domains, they
require fixed sensor numbers and locations, lack mechanisms for uncertainty
quantification (UQ), and are thus limited in practical applicability. Recent
permutationinvariant extensions, such as the Variable-Input Deep Operator
Network (VIDON), relax these sensor constraints but still rely on sufficiently
dense observations and cannot capture uncertainties arising from incomplete
measurements or from operators with inherent randomness. To address these
challenges, we propose UQ-SONet, a permutation-invariant operator learning
framework with built-in UQ. Our model integrates a set transformer embedding to
handle sparse and variable sensor locations, and employs a conditional
variational autoencoder (cVAE) to approximate the conditional distribution of
the solution operator. By minimizing the negative ELBO, UQ-SONet provides
principled uncertainty estimation while maintaining predictive accuracy.
Numerical experiments on deterministic and stochastic PDEs, including the
Navier-Stokes equation, demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the
proposed framework.

Conclusion: BaB-prob是一种高效的概率验证方法，适用于中高维输入问题，且具有理论保证。

Abstract: Branch-and-bound with preactivation splitting has been shown highly effective
for deterministic verification of neural networks. In this paper, we extend
this framework to the probabilistic setting. We propose BaB-prob that
iteratively divides the original problem into subproblems by splitting
preactivations and leverages linear bounds computed by linear bound propagation
to bound the probability for each subproblem. We prove soundness and
completeness of BaB-prob for feedforward-ReLU neural networks. Furthermore, we
introduce the notion of uncertainty level and design two efficient strategies
for preactivation splitting, yielding BaB-prob-ordered and BaB+BaBSR-prob. We
evaluate BaB-prob on untrained networks, MNIST and CIFAR-10 models,
respectively, and VNN-COMP 2025 benchmarks. Across these settings, our approach
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in medium- to
high-dimensional input problems.

Motivation: 现有方法（如迭代修剪、动态稀疏训练）成本高或需预设目标密度，PWMPR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: PWMPR从稀疏种子开始，通过路径核启发式分数添加边，随机化缓解瓶颈，并通过逻辑拟合规则停止生长。

Result: 在CIFAR、TinyImageNet和ImageNet上，PWMPR性能接近IMP彩票券，但成本显著降低（1.5倍密集训练vs. 3-4倍）。

Conclusion: 生长式密度发现是一种有前景的范式，补充了修剪和动态稀疏方法。

Abstract: The lottery ticket hypothesis suggests that dense networks contain sparse
subnetworks that can be trained in isolation to match full-model performance.
Existing approaches-iterative pruning, dynamic sparse training, and pruning at
initialization-either incur heavy retraining costs or assume the target density
is fixed in advance. We introduce Path Weight Magnitude Product-biased Random
growth (PWMPR), a constructive sparse-to-dense training paradigm that grows
networks rather than pruning them, while automatically discovering their
operating density. Starting from a sparse seed, PWMPR adds edges guided by
path-kernel-inspired scores, mitigates bottlenecks via randomization, and stops
when a logistic-fit rule detects plateauing accuracy. Experiments on CIFAR,
TinyImageNet, and ImageNet show that PWMPR approaches the performance of
IMP-derived lottery tickets-though at higher density-at substantially lower
cost (~1.5x dense vs. 3-4x for IMP). These results establish growth-based
density discovery as a promising paradigm that complements pruning and dynamic
sparsity.

TL;DR: NuRL是一种通过自生成提示来提升LLM推理上限的方法，解决了现有RL算法无法从‘难解’问题中学习的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL算法（如GRPO）无法从模型无法解决的问题中学习，导致模型的上限无法提升。NuRL旨在通过自生成提示来突破这一限制。

Method: NuRL在训练过程中对难解样本（通过率为0%）注入自生成的提示，从而引入训练信号并提升通过率。

Result: NuRL在6个基准测试和3个模型上均取得一致提升，且能提高模型的上限，而GRPO则无法改变模型的上限。

Conclusion: NuRL通过自生成提示有效提升了LLM的推理能力，尤其是在难解问题上，且与测试时扩展方法互补。

Abstract: Current online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms like GRPO share a key
limitation in LLM reasoning: they cannot learn from problems that are
"unsolvable" to the model. In other words, they can only improve performance on
problems where the model is capable of exploring the correct answer.
Consequently, the model's "upper limit" remains unchanged after RL training,
even though the likelihood of solving easier, solvable problems may increase.
These hard samples cannot contribute to training, as no rollouts yield rewards
and thus no gradients are produced. To unlock learning from these hard samples,
we propose NuRL, a "nudging" method that aims to push the upper bound of LLM
reasoning using self-generated hints, i.e., abstract cues that help reduce the
problem difficulty for the model. Given a question and its gold answer, the
model generates a CoT and then produces a hint containing the core knowledge
needed to solve the problem. During training, we generate G rollouts from the
base policy and use the pass rate to decide whether the hint should be
injected. For hard samples with a 0% pass rate, we inject the hint and
regenerate a new batch of trajectories. This yields two benefits: (1) the hint
boosts pass rates (from 0% to non-zero), thereby introducing training signals
for previously unsolvable samples, and (2) the hints are self-generated,
avoiding distributional shift and do not rely on external models. NuRL achieves
consistent improvements across 6 benchmarks and 3 models, while remaining
complementary to test-time scaling. Notably, NuRL can raise the model's upper
limit, whereas GRPO leaves pass@1024 unchanged from the base model.
Furthermore, we present a systematic study of what makes an effective hint and
when hints are most useful. Interestingly, the best hints are abstract and
high-level, and are most beneficial when applied necessarily and after GRPO has
converged.

Result: 在多个多模态基准测试中验证了性能提升和可解释性增强。

Conclusion: 时间交互动态能有效指导MoE路由，提升模型性能和专家泛化能力。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have become pivotal for large-scale
multimodal models. However, their routing mechanisms typically overlook the
informative, time-varying interaction dynamics between modalities. This
limitation hinders expert specialization, as the model cannot explicitly
leverage intrinsic modality relationships for effective reasoning. To address
this, we propose a novel framework that guides MoE routing using quantified
temporal interaction. A multimodal interaction-aware router learns to dispatch
tokens to experts based on the nature of their interactions. This dynamic
routing encourages experts to acquire generalizable interaction-processing
skills rather than merely learning task-specific features. Our framework builds
on a new formulation of temporal multimodal interaction dynamics, which are
used to guide expert routing. We first demonstrate that these temporal
multimodal interactions reveal meaningful patterns across applications, and
then show how they can be leveraged to improve both the design and performance
of MoE-based models. Comprehensive experiments on challenging multimodal
benchmarks validate our approach, demonstrating both enhanced performance and
improved interpretability.

Result: 生成的最小解释不仅保留了模型决策，还帮助理解模型内部计算机制。

Conclusion: 该方法为输入级解释和模型内部计算机制之间提供了实用桥梁。

Abstract: Machine learning models, by virtue of training, learn a large repertoire of
decision rules for any given input, and any one of these may suffice to justify
a prediction. However, in high-dimensional input spaces, such rules are
difficult to identify and interpret. In this paper, we introduce an
activation-matching based approach to generate minimal and faithful
explanations for the decisions of pre-trained image classifiers. We aim to
identify minimal explanations that not only preserve the model's decision but
are also concise and human-readable. To achieve this, we train a lightweight
autoencoder to produce binary masks that learns to highlight the decision-wise
critical regions of an image while discarding irrelevant background. The
training objective integrates activation alignment across multiple layers,
consistency at the output label, priors that encourage sparsity, and
compactness, along with a robustness constraint that enforces faithfulness. The
minimal explanations so generated also lead us to mechanistically interpreting
the model internals. In this regard we also introduce a circuit readout
procedure wherein using the explanation's forward pass and gradients, we
identify active channels and construct a channel-level graph, scoring
inter-layer edges by ingress weight magnitude times source activation and
feature-to-class links by classifier weight magnitude times feature activation.
Together, these contributions provide a practical bridge between minimal
input-level explanations and a mechanistic understanding of the internal
computations driving model decisions.

Motivation: 传统字典学习方法仅关注样本级别的稀疏性，忽略了原子在样本间的共享，导致冗余和次优字典。

Method: 引入基于$L_\infty$范数的正则化项，结合Beta-Bernoulli先验，从概率模型推导出公式，并优化超参数选择。

Result: 在基准数据集上，重建质量提升20%（RMSE降低），且仅使用不到十分之一的字典原子。

Conclusion: 该方法通过行级稀疏性优化，显著提升了字典学习的效率和性能，理论分析得到实验验证。

Abstract: Dictionary learning is traditionally formulated as an $L_1$-regularized
signal reconstruction problem. While recent developments have incorporated
discriminative, hierarchical, or generative structures, most approaches rely on
encouraging representation sparsity over individual samples that overlook how
atoms are shared across samples, resulting in redundant and sub-optimal
dictionaries. We introduce a parsimony promoting regularizer based on the
row-wise $L_\infty$ norm of the coefficient matrix. This additional penalty
encourages entire rows of the coefficient matrix to vanish, thereby reducing
the number of dictionary atoms activated across the dataset. We derive the
formulation from a probabilistic model with Beta-Bernoulli priors, which
provides a Bayesian interpretation linking the regularization parameters to
prior distributions. We further establish theoretical calculation for optimal
hyperparameter selection and connect our formulation to both Minimum
Description Length, Bayesian model selection and pathlet learning. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves
substantially improved reconstruction quality (with a 20\% reduction in RMSE)
and enhanced representation sparsity, utilizing fewer than one-tenth of the
available dictionary atoms, while empirically validating our theoretical
analysis.

Abstract: Active Test-Time Adaptation (ATTA) improves model robustness under domain

efficiency, wasting human annotation budget. We propose Conformal Prediction
Active TTA (CPATTA), which first brings principled, coverage-guaranteed
uncertainty into ATTA. CPATTA employs smoothed conformal scores with a top-K
certainty measure, an online weight-update algorithm driven by pseudo coverage,
a domain-shift detector that adapts human supervision, and a staged update
scheme balances human-labeled and model-labeled data. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that CPATTA consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ATTA

Result: 实验表明，TSQA模型不仅能成功训练，还能通过利用大量未标注数据超越VLM的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了TSQA任务中数据不足的问题，并展示了伪标签训练的潜力。

Abstract: Time-series question answering (TSQA) tasks face significant challenges due
to the lack of labeled data. Alternatively, with recent advancements in
large-scale models, vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated the
potential to analyze time-series signals in a zero-shot manner. In this paper,
we propose a training approach that uses pseudo labels generated by a VLM.
Although VLMs can produce incorrect labels, TSQA models can still be
effectively trained based on the property that deep neural networks are
inherently robust to such noisy labels. Our experimental results demonstrate
that TSQA models are not only successfully trained with pseudo labels, but also
surpass the performance of the VLM itself by leveraging a large amount of
unlabeled data.

Abstract: Accurate and physically feasible human motion prediction is crucial for safe
and seamless human-robot collaboration. While recent advancements in human
motion capture enable real-time pose estimation, the practical value of many
existing approaches is limited by the lack of fu- ture predictions and
consideration of physical constraints. Conventional motion prediction schemes
rely heavily on past poses, which are not always available in real-world
scenarios. To address these limitations, we present a physics-informed learning
framework that integrates domain knowledge into both training and inference to
predict human motion using inertial measurements from only 5 IMUs. We propose a
network that accounts for the spatial characteristics of human movements.
During training, we incorporate forward and differential kinematics functions
as additional loss components to regularize the learned joint predictions. At
the inference stage, we refine the prediction from the previous iteration to
update a joint state buffer, which is used as extra inputs to the network.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high accuracy,
smooth transitions between motions, and generalizes well to unseen subjects

Conclusion: 该方法能适应学习任务，适用于传统方法难以处理的场景（如异质性数据）。

Abstract: We propose an adaptive graph coarsening method to jointly learn graph neural
network (GNN) parameters and merge nodes via K-means clustering during
training. As real-world graphs grow larger, processing them directly becomes
increasingly challenging and sometimes infeasible. Tailoring algorithms to
large-scale data may sacrifice performance, so we instead consider graph
reduction to decrease the amount of data used during training. In particular,
we propose a method to simultaneously train a GNN and coarsen its graph by
partitioning nodes via K-means clustering based on their embeddings. Unlike
past graph coarsening works, our approach allows us to merge nodes during
training. Not only does this preclude coarsening as a preprocessing step, but
our node clusters can adapt to the learning task instead of relying solely on
graph connectivity and features. Thus, our method is amenable to scenarios that
are challenging for other methods, such as heterophilic data. We validate our
approach on both homophilic and heterophilic node classification datasets. We
further visualize relationships between node embeddings and their corresponding
clusters to illustrate that our coarsened graph adapts to the learning task
during training.

Result: 在MLLM和LLM基准测试中，该方法优于现有训练自由和训练基线，甚至在某些情况下超过监督混合训练。

Conclusion: Expert Merging提供了一种无标签、参数高效且可扩展的多专家模型合并方案。

Abstract: Model merging, which combines multiple domain-specialized experts into a
single model, offers a practical path to endow Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with broad capabilities without the
cost of joint training or serving many models. However, training-free methods
rely on hand-tuned coefficients, whereas training-based methods primarily align
parameters rather than downstream task behavior and typically treat all layers
uniformly, ignoring inter-layer heterogeneity. We introduce Expert Merging, a
training-light method that learns a small set of layer-wise coefficients using
only unlabeled calibration data. The coefficients are optimized to explicitly
align the merged model's hidden states and logits with those of the
corresponding experts, with a coefficient regularizer for stability and
task-weighted losses for controllable trade-offs. To capture inter-layer
variation, Expert Merging++ augments this design with importance-guided
chunking: a normalized layer-importance metric, derived from learned
coefficients, task-vector magnitudes, and parameter counts, allocates more
chunk-wise coefficients to high-importance layers while keeping low-importance
layers lightweight. The result is a label-free, parameter-efficient, and
scalable approach to multi-expert model merging across LLMs and MLLMs. Across
MLLM backbones (InternVL and Qwen2-VL) and the LLM backbone (Mistral), our
method surpasses strong training-free and training-based merging baselines,
with Expert Merging++ delivering further gains and, in some cases, even
exceeding supervised Mixture Training. The source code is available at

Abstract: Flow matching has recently emerged as a powerful framework for
continuous-time generative modeling. However, when applied to long-tailed
distributions, standard flow matching suffers from majority bias, producing
minority modes with low fidelity and failing to match the true class
proportions. In this work, we propose Unbalanced Optimal Transport Reweighted
Flow Matching (UOT-RFM), a novel framework for generative modeling under
class-imbalanced (long-tailed) distributions that operates without any class
label information. Our method constructs the conditional vector field using
mini-batch Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) and mitigates majority bias
through a principled inverse reweighting strategy. The reweighting relies on a
label-free majority score, defined as the density ratio between the target
distribution and the UOT marginal. This score quantifies the degree of majority
based on the geometric structure of the data, without requiring class labels.
By incorporating this score into the training objective, UOT-RFM theoretically
recovers the target distribution with first-order correction ($k=1$) and
empirically improves tail-class generation through higher-order corrections ($k
> 1$). Our model outperforms existing flow matching baselines on long-tailed
benchmarks, while maintaining competitive performance on balanced datasets.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MuPlon的新框架，通过双因果干预策略解决传统方法中的数据噪声和偏差问题，显著提升了声明验证的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统声明验证方法忽略了证据间的复杂交互，导致结果不可靠。MuPlon旨在通过优化节点权重和构建推理路径来解决这些问题。

Method: MuPlon采用双因果干预策略：后门路径通过优化节点概率权重减少噪声干扰，前门路径通过提取相关子图和应用反事实推理消除数据偏差。

Result: 实验表明，MuPlon优于现有方法，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MuPlon通过双路径因果干预有效解决了数据噪声和偏差问题，为声明验证任务提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: As a critical task in data quality control, claim verification aims to curb
the spread of misinformation by assessing the truthfulness of claims based on a
wide range of evidence. However, traditional methods often overlook the complex
interactions between evidence, leading to unreliable verification results. A
straightforward solution represents the claim and evidence as a fully connected
graph, which we define as the Claim-Evidence Graph (C-E Graph). Nevertheless,
claim verification methods based on fully connected graphs face two primary
confounding challenges, Data Noise and Data Biases. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Path Causal Optimization
(MuPlon). MuPlon integrates a dual causal intervention strategy, consisting of
the back-door path and front-door path. In the back-door path, MuPlon dilutes
noisy node interference by optimizing node probability weights, while
simultaneously strengthening the connections between relevant evidence nodes.
In the front-door path, MuPlon extracts highly relevant subgraphs and
constructs reasoning paths, further applying counterfactual reasoning to
eliminate data biases within these paths. The experimental results demonstrate
that MuPlon outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

We show that in line-of-sight simulations with a multi-antenna receiver, MC-CLE
learns critical properties including angular ambiguity and front-to-back
antenna patterns. MC-CLE also achieves lower cross-entropy loss relative to a
uniform baseline and Gaussian posteriors. alternatives under a uniform-loss

Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal
waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational
noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to
predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As
a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific
Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver
pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed
profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We
first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate
physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with
frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep
sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The
final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed
mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder
for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for
source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer
that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital
twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case
scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the
framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss
combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates
for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework
advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates
how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime
operations.

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has shown strong promise for unsupervised
graph representation learning, yet its effectiveness on heterophilic graphs,
where connected nodes often belong to different classes, remains limited. Most
existing methods rely on complex augmentation schemes, intricate encoders, or
negative sampling, which raises the question of whether such complexity is
truly necessary in this challenging setting. In this work, we revisit the
foundations of supervised and unsupervised learning on graphs and uncover a
simple yet effective principle for GCL: mitigating node feature noise by
aggregating it with structural features derived from the graph topology. This
observation suggests that the original node features and the graph structure
naturally provide two complementary views for contrastive learning. Building on
this insight, we propose an embarrassingly simple GCL model that uses a GCN
encoder to capture structural features and an MLP encoder to isolate node
feature noise. Our design requires neither data augmentation nor negative
sampling, yet achieves state-of-the-art results on heterophilic benchmarks with
minimal computational and memory overhead, while also offering advantages in
homophilic graphs in terms of complexity, scalability, and robustness. We
provide theoretical justification for our approach and validate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments, including robustness evaluations
against both black-box and white-box adversarial attacks.

Method: RCU利用旋转显著性权重量化控制遗忘程度，设计斜对称损失构建认知旋转空间，并通过正交旋转轴正则化最小化干扰。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，RCU无需保留数据集即可实现SOTA性能。

Conclusion: RCU有效解决了连续遗忘请求下的累积效用损失问题，为模型安全提供了新思路。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly prevalent, their security
vulnerabilities have already drawn attention. Machine unlearning is introduced
to seek to mitigate these risks by removing the influence of undesirable data.
However, existing methods not only rely on the retained dataset to preserve
model utility, but also suffer from cumulative catastrophic utility loss under
continuous unlearning requests. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel
method, called Rotation Control Unlearning (RCU), which leverages the
rotational salience weight of RCU to quantify and control the unlearning degree
in the continuous unlearning process. The skew symmetric loss is designed to
construct the existence of the cognitive rotation space, where the changes of
rotational angle can simulate the continuous unlearning process. Furthermore,
we design an orthogonal rotation axes regularization to enforce mutually
perpendicular rotation directions for continuous unlearning requests,
effectively minimizing interference and addressing cumulative catastrophic
utility loss. Experiments on multiple datasets confirm that our method without
retained dataset achieves SOTA performance.

Result: 训练速度提升1.8-2.8倍，GPU利用率提高1.4-2.1倍。

Conclusion: OPPO高效且易于集成，显著提升RLHF训练效率。

Abstract: Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF) is a widely adopted paradigm for aligning large language models
(LLMs) with human preferences. However, its training pipeline suffers from
substantial inefficiencies due to sequential multi-model dependencies (e.g.,
reward model depends on actor outputs) and long-tail response lengths, where a
few long responses straggle the stage completion. We present OPPO, a novel,
lightweight, and model-agnostic PPO-based RLHF framework that improves training
efficiency by overlapping pipeline execution. OPPO introduces two novel
techniques: (1) Intra-step overlap, which streams upstream model outputs (e.g.,
actor model) in right-sized chunks, enabling the downstream model (e.g.,
reward) to begin prefill while the upstream continues decoding; and (2)
Inter-step overlap, which adaptively overcommits a few prompts and defers long
generations to future steps, mitigating tail latency without discarding partial
work. OPPO integrates easily with existing PPO implementations with a few lines
of code change. Extensive evaluations show that OPPO accelerates PPO-based RLHF
training by $1.8 \times-2.8 \times$ and improves GPU utilization by $1.4
\times-2.1 \times$ without compromising training convergence.

Conclusion: 自主感知聚类框架能有效捕捉局部自主性对聚类的影响，显著提升聚类准确性。

Abstract: Clustering arises in a wide range of problem formulations, yet most existing
approaches assume that the entities under clustering are passive and strictly
conform to their assigned groups. In reality, entities often exhibit local
autonomy, overriding prescribed associations in ways not fully captured by
feature representations. Such autonomy can substantially reshape clustering
outcomes -- altering cluster compositions, geometry, and cardinality -- with
significant downstream effects on inference and decision-making. We introduce
autonomy-aware clustering, a reinforcement (RL) learning framework that learns
and accounts for the influence of local autonomy without requiring prior
knowledge of its form. Our approach integrates RL with a deterministic
annealing (DA) procedure, where, to determine underlying clusters, DA naturally
promotes exploration in early stages of annealing and transitions to
exploitation later. We also show that the annealing procedure exhibits phase
transitions that enable design of efficient annealing schedules. To further
enhance adaptability, we propose the Adaptive Distance Estimation Network
(ADEN), a transformer-based attention model that learns dependencies between
entities and cluster representatives within the RL loop, accommodates
variable-sized inputs and outputs, and enables knowledge transfer across
diverse problem instances. Empirical results show that our framework closely
aligns with underlying data dynamics: even without explicit autonomy models, it
achieves solutions close to the ground truth (gap ~3-4%), whereas ignoring
autonomy leads to substantially larger gaps (~35-40%). The code and data are
publicly available at https://github.com/salar96/AutonomyAwareClustering.

Conclusion: 该算法首次实现了动作空间扩展的在线学习中的次线性遗憾界。

Abstract: With advances in generative AI, decision-making agents can now dynamically
create new actions during online learning, but action generation typically
incurs costs that must be balanced against potential benefits. We study an
online learning problem where an agent can generate new actions at any time
step by paying a one-time cost, with these actions becoming permanently
available for future use. The challenge lies in learning the optimal sequence
of two-fold decisions: which action to take and when to generate new ones,
further complicated by the triangular tradeoffs among exploitation, exploration
and $\textit{creation}$. To solve this problem, we propose a doubly-optimistic
algorithm that employs Lower Confidence Bounds (LCB) for action selection and
Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) for action generation. Empirical evaluation on
healthcare question-answering datasets demonstrates that our approach achieves
favorable generation-quality tradeoffs compared to baseline strategies. From
theoretical perspectives, we prove that our algorithm achieves the optimal
regret of $O(T^{\frac{d}{d+2}}d^{\frac{d}{d+2}} + d\sqrt{T\log T})$, providing
the first sublinear regret bound for online learning with expanding action
spaces.

Abstract: Bridging information geometry with machine learning, this paper presents a
method for constructing neural networks intrinsically on statistical manifolds.
We demonstrate this approach by formulating a neural network architecture
directly on the lognormal statistical manifold. The construction is driven by
the Hamiltonian system that is equivalent to the gradient flow on this
manifold. First, we define the network's input values using the coordinate
system of this Hamiltonian dynamics, naturally embedded in the Poincare disk.
The core of our contribution lies in the derivation of the network's components
from geometric principles: the rotation component of the synaptic weight matrix
is determined by the Lie group action of SU(1,1) on the disk, while the
activation function emerges from the symplectic structure of the system. We
subsequently obtain the complete weight matrix, including its translation
vector, and the resulting output values. This work shows that the lognormal
manifold can be seamlessly viewed as a neural manifold, with its geometric
properties dictating a unique and interpretable neural network structure. The
proposed method offers a new paradigm for building learning systems grounded in
the differential geometry of their underlying parameter spaces.

Abstract: Industrial design evaluation often relies on high-fidelity simulations of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs). While accurate, these
simulations are computationally expensive, making dense exploration of design
spaces impractical. Operator learning has emerged as a promising approach to
accelerate PDE solution prediction; however, its effectiveness is often limited
by the scarcity of labeled physics-based data. At the same time, large numbers
of geometry-only candidate designs are readily available but remain largely
untapped. We propose a two-stage framework to better exploit this abundant,
physics-agnostic resource and improve supervised operator learning under
limited labeled data. In Stage 1, we pretrain an autoencoder on a geometry
reconstruction task to learn an expressive latent representation without PDE
labels. In Stage 2, the neural operator is trained in a standard supervised
manner to predict PDE solutions, using the pretrained latent embeddings as
inputs instead of raw point clouds. Transformer-based architectures are adopted
for both the autoencoder and the neural operator to handle point cloud data and
integrate both stages seamlessly. Across four PDE datasets and three
state-of-the-art transformer-based neural operators, our approach consistently
improves prediction accuracy compared to models trained directly on raw point
cloud inputs. These results demonstrate that representations from
physics-agnostic pretraining provide a powerful foundation for data-efficient
operator learning.

Abstract: Interventional causal discovery seeks to identify causal relations by
leveraging distributional changes introduced by interventions, even in the
presence of latent confounders. Beyond the spurious dependencies induced by
latent confounders, we highlight a common yet often overlooked challenge in the
problem due to post-treatment selection, in which samples are selectively
included in datasets after interventions. This fundamental challenge widely
exists in biological studies; for example, in gene expression analysis, both
observational and interventional samples are retained only if they meet quality
control criteria (e.g., highly active cells). Neglecting post-treatment
selection may introduce spurious dependencies and distributional changes under
interventions, which can mimic causal responses, thereby distorting causal
discovery results and challenging existing causal formulations. To address
this, we introduce a novel causal formulation that explicitly models
post-treatment selection and reveals how its differential reactions to
interventions can distinguish causal relations from selection patterns,
allowing us to go beyond traditional equivalence classes toward the underlying
true causal structure. We then characterize its Markov properties and propose a
Fine-grained Interventional equivalence class, named FI-Markov equivalence,
represented by a new graphical diagram, F-PAG. Finally, we develop a provably
sound and complete algorithm, F-FCI, to identify causal relations, latent
confounders, and post-treatment selection up to $\mathcal{FI}$-Markov
equivalence, using both observational and interventional data. Experimental
results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method
recovers causal relations despite the presence of both selection and latent
confounders.

accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, ROC-AUC, and error
rate (RMSE, MAE) measures. In addition, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)
was used to ascertain model explainability and clinical relevance. The
CardioForest model performed best on all metrics, achieving a test accuracy of
94.95%, a balanced accuracy of 88.31%, and high precision and recall metrics.
SHAP analysis confirmed the model's ability to rank the most relevant ECG
features, such as QRS duration, in accordance with clinical intuitions, thereby
fostering trust and usability in clinical practice. The findings recognize
CardioForest as an extremely dependable and interpretable WCT detection model.
Being able to offer accurate predictions and transparency through
explainability makes it a valuable tool to help cardiologists make timely and
well-informed diagnoses, especially for high-stakes and emergency scenarios.

Conclusion: AR3PO是一种高效且成本低的RLVR算法，适用于不同规模的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive reasoning performance,
with reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) emerging as a
standard paradigm for post-training. A representative algorithm, group relative
policy optimization (GRPO) (Shao et al., 2024), computes advantages by
normalizing outcome rewards within response groups, but suffers from a
vanishing advantage issue when all responses in a group receive identical
rewards. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Rollout and Response Reuse
Policy Optimization (AR3PO), a sampling efficient RLVR algorithm that
introduces two novel techniques: adaptive rollout, which dynamically allocates
more responses to difficult prompts while saving computation on easier ones,
and response reuse, which leverages previously generated correct responses to
provide useful training signals. We compare AR3PO with strong RLVR baselines on
multiple representative benchmarks using two different families of base models.
Across the 7B and 8B models, AR3PO consistently outperforms GRPO and matches or
surpasses DAPO (Yu et al., 2025), reducing rollout cost by up to 4.2x. On the
larger 32B model, AR3PO achieves comparable performance to DAPO at similar
training steps while maintaining substantially lower rollout cost.

Result: 在代码生成任务中，RA3显著提升了HumanEval和MBPP的性能，并实现了更快的收敛。

Conclusion: RA3在紧凑决策空间和短有效时间范围内表现最佳，验证了动作抽象的重要性。

Abstract: Large language models excel with reinforcement learning (RL), but fully
unlocking this potential requires a mid-training stage. An effective
mid-training phase should identify a compact set of useful actions and enable
fast selection among them through online RL. We formalize this intuition by
presenting the first theoretical result on how mid-training shapes
post-training: it characterizes an action subspace that minimizes both the
value approximation error from pruning and the RL error during subsequent
planning. Our analysis reveals two key determinants of mid-training
effectiveness: pruning efficiency, which shapes the prior of the initial RL
policy, and its impact on RL convergence, which governs the extent to which
that policy can be improved via online interactions. These results suggest that
mid-training is most effective when the decision space is compact and the
effective horizon is short, highlighting the importance of operating in the
space of action abstractions rather than primitive actions. Building on these
insights, we propose Reasoning as Action Abstractions (RA3), a scalable
mid-training algorithm. Specifically, we derive a sequential variational lower
bound and optimize it by iteratively discovering temporally-consistent latent
structures via RL, followed by fine-tuning on the bootstrapped data.
Experiments on code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. Across multiple base models, RA3 improves the average performance on
HumanEval and MBPP by 8 and 4 points over the base model and the next-token
prediction baseline. Furthermore, RA3 achieves faster convergence and higher
asymptotic performance in RLVR on HumanEval+, MBPP+, LiveCodeBench, and
Codeforces.

*Jingqi Fan,Canzhe Zhao,Shuai Li,Siwei Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对异步去中心化环境的多玩家多臂老虎机（MP-MAB）算法，解决了碰撞和玩家数量检测的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实系统通常是异步和去中心化的，但现有研究多集中于同步设置，因此需要解决异步环境中的协调和玩家数量检测问题。

Method: 开发了一种新算法，玩家在探索和利用之间自适应切换，通过均匀拉取臂减少碰撞概率，并通过小概率继续拉取他人利用的臂检测玩家离开。

Result: 算法实现了$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$的遗憾，并在实验中验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对异步去中心化环境的高效MP-MAB算法，适用于现实场景。

Abstract: In recent years, multi-player multi-armed bandits (MP-MAB) have been
extensively studied due to their wide applications in cognitive radio networks
and Internet of Things systems. While most existing research on MP-MAB focuses
on synchronized settings, real-world systems are often decentralized and
asynchronous, where players may enter or leave the system at arbitrary times,
and do not have a global clock. This decentralized asynchronous setting
introduces two major challenges. First, without a global time, players cannot
implicitly coordinate their actions through time, making it difficult to avoid
collisions. Second, it is important to detect how many players are in the
system, but doing so may cost a lot. In this paper, we address the challenges
posed by such a fully asynchronous setting in a decentralized environment. We
develop a novel algorithm in which players adaptively change between
exploration and exploitation. During exploration, players uniformly pull their
arms, reducing the probability of collisions and effectively mitigating the
first challenge. Meanwhile, players continue pulling arms currently exploited
by others with a small probability, enabling them to detect when a player has
left, thereby addressing the second challenge. We prove that our algorithm
achieves a regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T \log T} + {\log T}/{\Delta^2})$,
where $\Delta$ is the minimum expected reward gap between any two arms. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first efficient MP-MAB algorithm in the
asynchronous and decentralized environment. Extensive experiments further
validate the effectiveness and robustness of our algorithm, demonstrating its
applicability to real-world scenarios.

*Kun Feng,Shaocheng Lan,Yuchen Fang,Wenchao He,Lintao Ma,Xingyu Lu,Kan Ren*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kairos提出了一种灵活的时间序列基础模型框架，通过动态分块标记化和自适应位置编码，解决了现有模型在处理信息密度不均的时间序列时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列信息密度不均，现有模型处理流程固定，无法适应动态变化。

Method: 采用动态分块标记化和实例自适应位置嵌入，结合大规模可预测性分层时间序列数据集训练。

Result: 在零样本基准测试中表现优异，参数更少，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Kairos框架有效解决了时间序列建模中的动态适应问题，展示了强大的零样本能力。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for
time series analysis, driven by large-scale pretraining on diverse data
corpora. However, time series inherently exhibit heterogeneous information
density over time, influenced by system states and signal complexity,
presenting significant modeling challenges especially in a zero-shot scenario.
Current TSFMs rely on non-adaptive processing pipelines that fail to capture
this dynamic nature. For example, common tokenization strategies such as
fixed-size patching enforce rigid observational granularity, limiting their
ability to adapt to varying information densities. Similarly, conventional
positional encodings impose a uniform temporal scale, making it difficult to
model diverse periodicities and trends across series. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Kairos, a flexible TSFM framework that integrates a
dynamic patching tokenizer and an instance-adaptive positional embedding.
Kairos adaptively selects tokenization granularity and tailors positional
encodings to the unique characteristics of each time series instance. Trained
on a large-scale Predictability-Stratified Time Series (PreSTS) corpus
comprising over 300 billion time points and adopting a multi-patch prediction
strategy in the inference stage, Kairos achieves superior performance with much
fewer parameters on two common zero-shot benchmarks, GIFT-Eval and the
Time-Series-Library benchmark, consistently outperforming established methods
across diverse tasks. The project page is at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MIDAS是一种数据增强策略，通过生成语义不一致的多模态样本并引入弱模态权重和难样本权重，有效解决多模态模型中的模态不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态模型常过度依赖主导模态，而数据中心的解决方案尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出MIDAS，生成语义不一致的跨模态样本，并引入弱模态权重和难样本权重。

Result: 在多个多模态分类基准上，MIDAS显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MIDAS通过数据增强和动态权重调整，有效提升多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal models often over-rely on dominant modalities, failing to achieve
optimal performance. While prior work focuses on modifying training objectives
or optimization procedures, data-centric solutions remain underexplored. We
propose MIDAS, a novel data augmentation strategy that generates misaligned
samples with semantically inconsistent cross-modal information, labeled using
unimodal confidence scores to compel learning from contradictory signals.
However, this confidence-based labeling can still favor the more confident
modality. To address this within our misaligned samples, we introduce
weak-modality weighting, which dynamically increases the loss weight of the
least confident modality, thereby helping the model fully utilize weaker
modality. Furthermore, when misaligned features exhibit greater similarity to
the aligned features, these misaligned samples pose a greater challenge,
thereby enabling the model to better distinguish between classes. To leverage
this, we propose hard-sample weighting, which prioritizes such semantically
ambiguous misaligned samples. Experiments on multiple multimodal classification
benchmarks demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms related baselines
in addressing modality imbalance.

*Yeongmin Kim,Donghyeok Shin,Mina Kang,Byeonghu Na,Il-Chul Moon*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Concrete Score Distillation (CSD)的新方法，用于改进大型语言模型的知识蒸馏，解决了现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法存在软最大平滑和对数位移不变性限制的问题，需要一种更高效的蒸馏目标。

Method: CSD通过离散分数匹配目标，避免了软最大平滑，并放宽了对最优解集的限制，同时解决了训练不稳定性和二次复杂度问题。

Result: 实验表明，CSD在任务无关和任务特定的蒸馏中均优于现有方法，实现了更好的保真度-多样性权衡。

Conclusion: CSD是一种可扩展且有效的LLM蒸馏方法，能够与其他技术结合产生互补增益。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) deliver remarkable performance but are costly to
deploy, motivating knowledge distillation (KD) for efficient inference.
Existing KD objectives typically match student and teacher probabilities via
softmax, which blurs valuable logit information. While direct logit
distillation (DLD) mitigates softmax smoothing, it fails to account for logit
shift invariance, thereby restricting the solution space. We propose Concrete
Score Distillation (CSD), a discrete score-matching objective that overcomes
both softmax-induced smoothing and restrictions on the optimal solution set. We
resolve the training instability and quadratic complexity of discrete
score-matching in autoregressive LLMs, and the resulting CSD objective aligns
relative logit differences across all vocabulary pairs between student and
teacher with flexible weighting. We provide both mode-seeking and mode-covering
instances within our framework and evaluate CSD on task-agnostic
instruction-following and task-specific distillation using GPT-2-1.5B,
OpenLLaMA-7B, and GEMMA-7B-IT. Experiments show that CSD consistently surpasses
recent KD objectives, achieves favorable fidelity-diversity trade-offs, and
yields complementary gains when combined with on-policy techniques,
demonstrating its scalability and effectiveness for LLM distillation.

*Suping Xu,Chuyi Dai,Ye Liu,Lin Shang,Xibei Yang,Witold Pedrycz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于空间感知可分性准则的特征选择方法S²FS，用于模糊决策系统，显著提升了分类和聚类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能直接关联评估标准与学习性能，或仅依赖非方向性欧氏距离，限制了决策边界的清晰性。

Method: S²FS结合类内紧凑性和类间分离性，整合标量距离与空间方向信息，采用前向贪婪策略选择特征。

Result: 在十个真实数据集上，S²FS在分类和聚类性能上均优于八种先进算法，且所选特征更具可解释性。

Conclusion: S²FS通过空间感知可分性准则，显著提升了模糊决策系统的特征选择效果。

Abstract: Feature selection is crucial for fuzzy decision systems (FDSs), as it
identifies informative features and eliminates rule redundancy, thereby
enhancing predictive performance and interpretability. Most existing methods
either fail to directly align evaluation criteria with learning performance or
rely solely on non-directional Euclidean distances to capture relationships
among decision classes, which limits their ability to clarify decision
boundaries. However, the spatial distribution of instances has a potential
impact on the clarity of such boundaries. Motivated by this, we propose
Spatially-aware Separability-driven Feature Selection (S$^2$FS), a novel
framework for FDSs guided by a spatially-aware separability criterion. This
criterion jointly considers within-class compactness and between-class
separation by integrating scalar-distances with spatial directional
information, providing a more comprehensive characterization of class
structures. S$^2$FS employs a forward greedy strategy to iteratively select the
most discriminative features. Extensive experiments on ten real-world datasets
demonstrate that S$^2$FS consistently outperforms eight state-of-the-art
feature selection algorithms in both classification accuracy and clustering
performance, while feature visualizations further confirm the interpretability
of the selected features.

*Ziniu Li,Congliang Chen,Tianyun Yang,Tian Ding,Ruoyu Sun,Ge Zhang,Wenhao Huang,Zhi-Quan Luo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于背包问题的最优探索预算分配方法，显著提升了大型语言模型在强化学习中的训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在探索预算分配上采用均匀分配，导致简单任务和困难任务都无法有效学习，梯度为零。

Method: 将任务探索视为背包问题中的物品，根据价值和成本动态分配预算，优化GRPO训练。

Result: 非零梯度比例提升20-40%，数学推理任务平均提升2-4分，峰值提升9分。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升训练效率，节省计算资源，适用于复杂任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can self-improve through reinforcement learning,
where they generate trajectories to explore and discover better solutions.
However, this exploration process is computationally expensive, often forcing
current methods to assign limited exploration budgets to each task. This
uniform allocation creates problematic edge cases: easy tasks consistently
succeed while difficult tasks consistently fail, both producing zero gradients
during training updates for the widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO). We address this problem from the lens of exploration budget allocation.
Viewing each task's exploration as an "item" with a distinct "value" and
"cost", we establish a connection to the classical knapsack problem. This
formulation allows us to derive an optimal assignment rule that adaptively
distributes resources based on the model's current learning status. When
applied to GRPO, our method increases the effective ratio of non-zero policy
gradients by 20-40% during training. Acting as a computational "free lunch",
our approach could reallocate exploration budgets from tasks where learning is
saturated to those where it is most impactful. This enables significantly
larger budgets (e.g., 93 rollouts) for especially challenging problems, which
would be computationally prohibitive under a uniform allocation. These
improvements translate to meaningful gains on mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, with average improvements of 2-4 points and peak gains of 9 points
on specific tasks. Notably, achieving comparable performance with traditional
homogeneous allocation would require about 2x the computational resources.

Method: 将问题建模为MDP，利用RL方法学习最优数据选择策略，基于代理模型奖励信号。

Result: 在5%数据子集上微调，性能优于全数据集，最高提升10.8准确率点，训练时间减半。

Conclusion: RL引导的数据选择在微调LLMs中展现出显著潜力。

Abstract: Data selection for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) can be framed as a
budget-constrained optimization problem: maximizing a model's downstream
performance under a strict training data budget. Solving this problem is
generally intractable, and existing approximate approaches are
pretraining-oriented and transfer poorly to the fine-tuning setting. We
reformulate this problem as a tractable Markov Decision Process (MDP) and train
agents using various Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods to learn optimal data
selection policies, guided by an efficient, proxy-model-based reward signal.
Across four datasets, training on a $5\%$ subset selected by our approach
matches or outperforms fine-tuning on the full dataset by up to $10.8$ accuracy
points, while cutting wall-clock training time by up to $2 \times$,
highlighting the promise of RL-guided data selection.

Result: 在复杂连续控制环境中，ExploRLer在不增加梯度更新次数的情况下显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 迭代级探索是一种实用且有效的方法，可以增强策略梯度强化学习，并为替代目标的局限性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Policy-gradient methods such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are
typically updated along a single stochastic gradient direction, leaving the
rich local structure of the parameter space unexplored. Previous work has shown
that the surrogate gradient is often poorly correlated with the true reward
landscape. Building on this insight, we visualize the parameter space spanned
by policy checkpoints within an iteration and reveal that higher performing
solutions often lie in nearby unexplored regions. To exploit this opportunity,
we introduce ExploRLer, a pluggable pipeline that seamlessly integrates with
on-policy algorithms such as PPO and TRPO, systematically probing the
unexplored neighborhoods of surrogate on-policy gradient updates. Without
increasing the number of gradient updates, ExploRLer achieves significant
improvements over baselines in complex continuous control environments. Our
results demonstrate that iteration-level exploration provides a practical and
effective way to strengthen on-policy reinforcement learning and offer a fresh
perspective on the limitations of the surrogate objective.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中差分隐私带来的噪声对模型准确性的负面影响。

Method: 提出MS-PAFL框架，将模型分割为私有和公共子模型，仅在公共子模型注入噪声。

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，MS-PAFL在强隐私保护下仍能训练高精度模型。

Conclusion: MS-PAFL在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得了优越的平衡。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) often adopts differential privacy (DP) to protect
client data, but the added noise required for privacy guarantees can
substantially degrade model accuracy. To resolve this challenge, we propose
model-splitting privacy-amplified federated learning (MS-PAFL), a novel
framework that combines structural model splitting with statistical privacy
amplification. In this framework, each client's model is partitioned into a
private submodel, retained locally, and a public submodel, shared for global
aggregation. The calibrated Gaussian noise is injected only into the public
submodel, thereby confining its adverse impact while preserving the utility of
the local model. We further present a rigorous theoretical analysis that
characterizes the joint privacy amplification achieved through random client
participation and local data subsampling under this architecture. The analysis
provides tight bounds on both single-round and total privacy loss,
demonstrating that MS-PAFL significantly reduces the noise necessary to satisfy
a target privacy protection level. Extensive experiments validate our
theoretical findings, showing that MS-PAFL consistently attains a superior
privacy-utility trade-off and enables the training of highly accurate models
under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: Neural Forecasters (NFs) are a cornerstone of Long-term Time Series
Forecasting (LTSF). However, progress has been hampered by an overemphasis on
architectural complexity at the expense of fundamental forecasting principles.
In this work, we return to first principles to redesign the LTSF paradigm. We
begin by introducing a Multiple Neural Forecasting Theorem that provides a
theoretical basis for our approach. We propose Boosted Direct Output (BDO), a
novel forecasting strategy that synergistically combines the advantages of both
Auto-Regressive (AR) and Direct Output (DO). In addition, we stabilize the
learning process by smoothly tracking the model's parameters. Extensive
experiments show that these principled improvements enable a simple MLP to
achieve state-of-the-art performance, outperforming recent, complex models in
nearly all cases, without any specific considerations in the area. Finally, we
empirically verify our theorem, establishing a dynamic performance bound and
identifying promising directions for future research. The code for review is

Result: 研究发现温度调节对输出层性能至关重要，并验证了Group-Sum层在多达2000类的分类任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: DLGNs在大规模分类任务中具有潜力，温度调节和合适的输出层策略是关键因素。

Abstract: Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs) are a very fast and
energy-efficient alternative to conventional feed-forward networks. With
learnable combinations of logical gates, DLGNs enable fast inference by
hardware-friendly execution. Since the concept of DLGNs has only recently
gained attention, these networks are still in their developmental infancy,
including the design and scalability of their output layer. To date, this
architecture has primarily been tested on datasets with up to ten classes.
  This work examines the behavior of DLGNs on large multi-class datasets. We
investigate its general expressiveness, its scalability, and evaluate
alternative output strategies. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we
provide key insights into the importance of temperature tuning and its impact
on output layer performance. We evaluate conditions under which the Group-Sum
layer performs well and how it can be applied to large-scale classification of
up to 2000 classes.

Conclusion: AIM兼具性能优势和可解释性，为多属性分子设计提供更鲁棒和直观的模型。

Abstract: Simultaneously optimizing multiple, frequently conflicting, molecular
properties is a key bottleneck in the development of novel therapeutics.
Although a promising approach, the efficacy of multi-task learning is often
compromised by destructive gradient interference, especially in the data-scarce
regimes common to drug discovery. To address this, we propose AIM, an
optimization framework that learns a dynamic policy to mediate gradient
conflicts. The policy is trained jointly with the main network using a novel
augmented objective composed of dense, differentiable regularizers. This
objective guides the policy to produce updates that are geometrically stable
and dynamically efficient, prioritizing progress on the most challenging tasks.
We demonstrate that AIM achieves statistically significant improvements over
multi-task baselines on subsets of the QM9 and targeted protein degraders
benchmarks, with its advantage being most pronounced in data-scarce regimes.
Beyond performance, AIM's key contribution is its interpretability; the learned
policy matrix serves as a diagnostic tool for analyzing inter-task
relationships. This combination of data-efficient performance and diagnostic
insight highlights the potential of adaptive optimizers to accelerate
scientific discovery by creating more robust and insightful models for
multi-property molecular design.

Abstract: Autonomous Raman instruments on Mars rovers, deep-sea landers, and field
robots must interpret raw spectra distorted by fluorescence baselines, peak
shifts, and limited ground-truth labels. Using curated subsets of the RRUFF
database, we evaluate one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and
report four advances: (i) Baseline-independent classification: compact CNNs
surpass $k$-nearest-neighbors and support-vector machines on handcrafted
features, removing background-correction and peak-picking stages while ensuring
reproducibility through released data splits and scripts. (ii)
Pooling-controlled robustness: tuning a single pooling parameter accommodates
Raman shifts up to $30 \,\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$, balancing translational invariance
with spectral resolution. (iii) Label-efficient learning: semi-supervised
generative adversarial networks and contrastive pretraining raise accuracy by
up to $11\%$ with only $10\%$ labels, valuable for autonomous deployments with
scarce annotation. (iv) Constant-time adaptation: freezing the CNN backbone and
retraining only the softmax layer transfers models to unseen minerals at
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ cost, outperforming Siamese networks on resource-limited
processors. This workflow, which involves training on raw spectra, tuning
pooling, adding semi-supervision when labels are scarce, and fine-tuning
lightly for new targets, provides a practical path toward robust, low-footprint
Raman classification in autonomous exploration.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm across multiple
entities while preserving data privacy. However, with the continuous emergence
of new data and increasing model diversity, traditional federated learning
faces significant challenges, including inherent issues of data heterogeneity,
model heterogeneity and catastrophic forgetting, along with new challenge of
knowledge misalignment. In this study, we introduce FedDCL, a novel framework
designed to enable data-free continual learning of the server model in a
model-heterogeneous federated setting. We leverage pre-trained diffusion models
to extract lightweight class-specific prototypes, which confer a threefold
data-free advantage, enabling: (1) generation of synthetic data for the current
task to augment training and counteract non-IID data distributions; (2)
exemplar-free generative replay for retaining knowledge from previous tasks;
and (3) data-free dynamic knowledge transfer from heterogeneous clients to the
server. Experimental results on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of FedDCL, showcasing its potential to enhance the generalizability and
practical applicability of federated learning in dynamic settings.

Abstract: Within the PAC-Bayesian framework, the Gibbs classifier (defined on a
posterior $Q$) and the corresponding $Q$-weighted majority vote classifier are
commonly used to analyze the generalization performance. However, there exists
a notable lack in theoretical research exploring the certified robustness of
majority vote classifier and its interplay with generalization. In this study,
we develop a generalization error bound that possesses a certified robust
radius for the smoothed majority vote classifier (i.e., the $Q$-weighted
majority vote classifier with smoothed inputs); In other words, the
generalization bound holds under any data perturbation within the certified
robust radius. As a byproduct, we find that the underpinnings of both the
generalization bound and the certified robust radius draw, in part, upon weight
spectral norm, which thereby inspires the adoption of spectral regularization
in smooth training to boost certified robustness. Utilizing the
dimension-independent property of spherical Gaussian inputs in smooth training,
we propose a novel and inexpensive spectral regularizer to enhance the smoothed
majority vote classifier. In addition to the theoretical contribution, a set of
empirical results is provided to substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed
method.

Conclusion: QSBP为生成建模提供了新的视角，其量子特性在随机过程中展现出独特优势，未来可进一步探索其应用潜力。

Abstract: The Quantum Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem (QSBP) describes the evolution of a
stochastic process between two arbitrary probability distributions, where the
dynamics are governed by the Schr\"odinger equation rather than by the
traditional real-valued wave equation. Although the QSBP is known in the
mathematical literature, we formulate it here from a Lagrangian perspective and
derive its main features in a way that is particularly suited to generative
modeling. We show that the resulting evolution equations involve the so-called
Bohm (quantum) potential, representing a notion of non-locality in the
stochastic process. This distinguishes the QSBP from classical stochastic
dynamics and reflects a key characteristic typical of quantum mechanical
systems. In this work, we derive exact closed-form solutions for the QSBP
between Gaussian distributions. Our derivation is based on solving the
Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) and the Hamilton-Jacobi Equation (HJE) arising
from the Lagrangian formulation of dynamical Optimal Transport. We find that,
similar to the classical Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem, the solution to the QSBP
between Gaussians is again a Gaussian process; however, the evolution of the
covariance differs due to quantum effects. Leveraging these explicit solutions,
we present a modified algorithm based on a Gaussian Mixture Model framework,
and demonstrate its effectiveness across several experimental settings,
including single-cell evolution data, image generation, molecular translation
and applications in Mean-Field Games.

Motivation: 减少大型语言模型在推理时的延迟和内存消耗，同时保持模型性能。

Method: 提出CAST框架，包含AdamS优化器、权重缩放模块和知识蒸馏技术，实现联合优化和渐进稀疏化。

Result: 在2:4稀疏模式下，模型性能优于现有方法，LLaMA2-7B稀疏模型的困惑度仅增加0.09，零样本准确率提升0.36%。

Conclusion: CAST是一种高效且实用的稀疏训练方法，适用于量化与微调场景，并能通过经验缩放定律预测性能。

Abstract: Sparsity-aware training is an effective approach for transforming large
language models (LLMs) into hardware-friendly sparse patterns, thereby reducing
latency and memory consumption during inference. In this paper, we propose
Continuous Adaptive Sparse Trainer (CAST), a fully continuous and
differentiable sparsity-aware training framework for semi-structured (or "N:M")
sparse models. Unlike previous approaches that optimize sparsity patterns and
weights separately, CAST enables seamless joint optimization during training,
while progressively transforming the model into the desired sparsity format.
Specifically, CAST introduces three key components: 1) AdamS, a sparsity-aware
optimizer that leverages adaptive L1 decay to promote uniform sparsification
across all parameters; 2) Weight Scaling, a module designed to mitigate the
magnitude reduction caused by decay while preserving desired sparsity patterns;
3) Knowledge Distillation, which employs the dense model as a self-teacher to
enhance training efficiency. We evaluate CAST under 2:4 sparsity patterns
across multiple model families, ranging from 125M to 13B parameters. Our
results demonstrate significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art
methods in both perplexity and zero-shot accuracy with minimal training
resources. Notably, on LLaMA2-7B, our 2:4 sparse model achieves a negligible
perplexity increase of 0.09 and a 0.36% gain in zero-shot accuracy compared to
the dense model using only 2% of the original pretraining tokens. Additionally,
we establish an accurate and robust empirical scaling law to predict sparse
model performance given adequate training resources. Finally, we demonstrate
the practical applicability of our sparse models by evaluating them under
quantization and fine-tuning scenarios.

Result: 在导航任务和合成环境中验证了方法的有效性，提升了学习效率和价值估计。

Conclusion: 挑战了完整状态访问的必要性，为不对称强化学习方法提供了新方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in partially observable environments requires agents
to act under uncertainty from noisy, incomplete observations. Asymmetric
actor-critic methods leverage privileged information during training to improve
learning under these conditions. However, existing approaches typically assume
full-state access during training. In this work, we challenge this assumption
by proposing a novel actor-critic framework, called informed asymmetric
actor-critic, that enables conditioning the critic on arbitrary privileged
signals without requiring access to the full state. We show that policy
gradients remain unbiased under this formulation, extending the theoretical
foundation of asymmetric methods to the more general case of privileged partial
information. To quantify the impact of such signals, we propose informativeness
measures based on kernel methods and return prediction error, providing
practical tools for evaluating training-time signals. We validate our approach
empirically on benchmark navigation tasks and synthetic partially observable
environments, showing that our informed asymmetric method improves learning
efficiency and value estimation when informative privileged inputs are
available. Our findings challenge the necessity of full-state access and open
new directions for designing asymmetric reinforcement learning methods that are
both practical and theoretically sound.

Result: 在合成任务和实际应用中，间接注意力机制表现出更好的处理不对齐能力。

Conclusion: 间接注意力机制能有效解决键和值不对齐问题，提升注意力机制的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The attention mechanism has become a cornerstone of modern deep learning
architectures, where keys and values are typically derived from the same
underlying sequence or representation. This work explores a less conventional
scenario, when keys and values originate from different sequences or
modalities. Specifically, we first analyze the attention mechanism's behavior
under noisy value features, establishing a critical noise threshold beyond
which signal degradation becomes significant. Furthermore, we model context
(key, value) misalignment as an effective form of structured noise within the
value features, demonstrating that the noise induced by such misalignment can
substantially exceed this critical threshold, thereby compromising standard
attention's efficacy. Motivated by this, we introduce Indirect Attention, a
modified attention mechanism that infers relevance indirectly in scenarios with
misaligned context. We evaluate the performance of Indirect Attention across a
range of synthetic tasks and real world applications, showcasing its superior
ability to handle misalignment.

Motivation: 时尚行业缺乏可信且易理解的可持续性信息，通用语言模型易产生幻觉，需领域专用解决方案。

Result: FITS在用户评估中表现良好，展示了领域专用NLP的价值，并提供了可持续性数据集。

Conclusion: 领域适应的NLP能促进决策，AI在气候挑战中有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Access to credible sustainability information in the fashion industry remains
limited and challenging to interpret, despite growing public and regulatory
demands for transparency. General-purpose language models often lack
domain-specific knowledge and tend to "hallucinate", which is particularly
harmful for fields where factual correctness is crucial. This work explores how
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to classify
sustainability data for fashion brands, thereby addressing the scarcity of
credible and accessible information in this domain. We present a prototype
Fashion Information Tool for Sustainability (FITS), a transformer-based system
that extracts and classifies sustainability information from credible,
unstructured text sources: NGO reports and scientific publications. Several
BERT-based language models, including models pretrained on scientific and
climate-specific data, are fine-tuned on our curated corpus using a
domain-specific classification schema, with hyperparameters optimized via
Bayesian optimization. FITS allows users to search for relevant data, analyze
their own data, and explore the information via an interactive interface. We
evaluated FITS in two focus groups of potential users concerning usability,
visual design, content clarity, possible use cases, and desired features. Our
results highlight the value of domain-adapted NLP in promoting informed
decision-making and emphasize the broader potential of AI applications in
addressing climate-related challenges. Finally, this work provides a valuable
dataset, the SustainableTextileCorpus, along with a methodology for future
updates. Code available at https://github.com/daphne12345/FITS

TL;DR: Muon优化器在训练大型语言模型（LLMs）时比Adam更快，其成功机制与关联记忆有关，尤其在处理重尾数据时表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究Muon优化器在LLMs训练中优于Adam的机制，并通过关联记忆视角解释其在重尾数据上的优势。

Method: 通过消融实验分析Muon优化的Transformer组件，并结合理论分析单层关联记忆模型在类别不平衡数据下的表现。

Result: Muon的更新规则产生更各向同性的奇异谱，能更有效地优化重尾数据中的尾部类别，且在理论上证明其学习更平衡。

Conclusion: Muon的核心优势在于其更新规则与线性关联记忆的外积结构一致，使其在重尾分布中比Adam更平衡和高效。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer is consistently faster than Adam in training Large
Language Models (LLMs), yet the mechanism underlying its success remains
unclear. This paper demystifies this mechanism through the lens of associative
memory. By ablating the transformer components optimized by Muon, we reveal
that the associative memory parameters of LLMs, namely the Value and Output
(VO) attention weights and Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs), are the primary
contributors to Muon's superiority. Motivated by this associative memory view,
we then explain Muon's superiority on real-world corpora, which are
intrinsically heavy-tailed: a few classes (tail classes) appear far less
frequently than others. The superiority is explained through two key
properties: (i) its update rule consistently yields a more isotropic singular
spectrum than Adam; and as a result, (ii) on heavy-tailed data, it optimizes
tail classes more effectively than Adam. Beyond empirical evidence, we
theoretically confirm these findings by analyzing a one-layer associative
memory model under class-imbalanced data. We prove that Muon consistently
achieves balanced learning across classes regardless of feature embeddings,
whereas Adam can induce large disparities in learning errors depending on
embedding properties. In summary, our empirical observations and theoretical
analyses reveal Muon's core advantage: its update rule aligns with the
outer-product structure of linear associative memories, enabling more balanced
and effective learning of tail classes in heavy-tailed distributions than Adam.

Motivation: 现有图分类后门攻击方法因结构或语义异常容易被检测，需要更隐蔽的攻击手段。

Method: 提出DPSBA框架，利用对抗训练和异常感知判别器学习分布内触发器。

Result: DPSBA在攻击成功率和隐蔽性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPSBA在真实数据集上验证了其有效性和隐蔽性的平衡。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated strong performance across
tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification,
but remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks that implant imperceptible triggers
during training to control predictions. While node-level attacks exploit local
message passing, graph-level attacks face the harder challenge of manipulating
global representations while maintaining stealth. We identify two main sources
of anomaly in existing graph classification backdoor methods: structural
deviation from rare subgraph triggers and semantic deviation caused by label
flipping, both of which make poisoned graphs easily detectable by anomaly
detection models. To address this, we propose DPSBA, a clean-label backdoor
framework that learns in-distribution triggers via adversarial training guided
by anomaly-aware discriminators. DPSBA effectively suppresses both structural
and semantic anomalies, achieving high attack success while significantly
improving stealth. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate that
DPSBA achieves a superior balance between effectiveness and detectability
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Motivation: 解决现有TDG方法因仅预测分类器层而导致的泛化能力不足问题，同时避免全模型预测的高计算成本。

Method: 1. 通过约束权重变化在单个时间域上微调基础模型，创建功能多样但参数相似的专家模型；2. 在主成分子空间中建模时间权重轨迹，优化偏差-方差权衡，自适应计算平均系数。

Result: 在7个TDG基准测试、5种模型和2种TDG设置中，TEA比现有方法性能提升高达69%，效率提升高达60倍。

Conclusion: TEA通过权重平均和自适应系数优化，实现了高效且强大的时间域泛化能力。

Abstract: Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) aims to generalize across temporal
distribution shifts, e.g., lexical change over time. Prior work often addresses
this by predicting future model weights. However, full model prediction is
prohibitively expensive for even reasonably sized models. Thus, recent methods
only predict the classifier layer, limiting generalization by failing to adjust
other model components. To address this, we propose Temporal Experts Averaging
(TEA), a novel and scalable TDG framework that updates the entire model using
weight averaging to maximize generalization potential while minimizing
computational costs. Our theoretical analysis guides us to two steps that
enhance generalization to future domains. First, we create expert models with
functional diversity yet parameter similarity by fine-tuning a domain-agnostic
base model on individual temporal domains while constraining weight changes.
Second, we optimize the bias-variance tradeoff through adaptive averaging
coefficients derived from modeling temporal weight trajectories in a principal
component subspace. Expert's contributions are based on their projected
proximity to future domains. Extensive experiments across 7 TDG benchmarks, 5
models, and 2 TDG settings shows TEA outperforms prior TDG methods by up to 69%
while being up to 60x more efficient.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) artifact detection in real-world settings faces
significant challenges such as computational inefficiency in multi-channel
methods, poor robustness to simultaneous noise, and trade-offs between accuracy
and complexity in deep learning models. We propose a hybrid spectral-temporal
framework for real-time detection and classification of ocular (EOG), muscular
(EMG), and white noise artifacts in single-channel EEG. This method, in
contrast to other approaches, combines time-domain low-pass filtering
(targeting low-frequency EOG) and frequency-domain power spectral density (PSD)
analysis (capturing broad-spectrum EMG), followed by PCA-optimized feature
fusion to minimize redundancy while preserving discriminative information. This
feature engineering strategy allows a lightweight multi-layer perceptron (MLP)
architecture to outperform advanced CNNs and RNNs by achieving 99% accuracy at
low SNRs (SNR -7) dB and >90% accuracy in moderate noise (SNR 4 dB).
Additionally, this framework addresses the unexplored problem of simultaneous
multi-source contamination(EMG+EOG+white noise), where it maintains 96%
classification accuracy despite overlapping artifacts. With 30-second training
times (97% faster than CNNs) and robust performance across SNR levels, this
framework bridges the gap between clinical applicability and computational
efficiency, which enables real-time use in wearable brain-computer interfaces.
This work also challenges the ubiquitous dependence on model depth for EEG
artifact detection by demonstrating that domain-informed feature fusion
surpasses complex architecture in noisy scenarios.

Result: clip-low增加熵，clip-high减少熵；调整clip-low可防止熵崩溃。

Conclusion: 裁剪机制是RLVR中被忽视的干扰因素，可通过调整clip-low控制熵。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM
quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and
progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the
clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through
theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy,
while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the
effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even
when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings
highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward
signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the
reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be
deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive
clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately
prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.

Result: 实验表明，UncertainGen在真实宏基因组数据集上优于确定性k-mer和LLM嵌入方法。

Conclusion: UncertainGen为大规模宏基因组分析提供了可扩展且轻量化的解决方案。

Abstract: Metagenomic binning aims to cluster DNA fragments from mixed microbial
samples into their respective genomes, a critical step for downstream analyses
of microbial communities. Existing methods rely on deterministic
representations, such as k-mer profiles or embeddings from large language
models, which fail to capture the uncertainty inherent in DNA sequences arising
from inter-species DNA sharing and from fragments with highly similar
representations. We present the first probabilistic embedding approach,
UncertainGen, for metagenomic binning, representing each DNA fragment as a
probability distribution in latent space. Our approach naturally models
sequence-level uncertainty, and we provide theoretical guarantees on embedding
distinguishability. This probabilistic embedding framework expands the feasible
latent space by introducing a data-adaptive metric, which in turn enables more
flexible separation of bins/clusters. Experiments on real metagenomic datasets
demonstrate the improvements over deterministic k-mer and LLM-based embeddings
for the binning task by offering a scalable and lightweight solution for
large-scale metagenomic analysis.

Conclusion: 研究表明，领域感知的HDC编码是必要的，优化后的HDC为受限硬件上的实时工业AI提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Smart manufacturing requires on-device intelligence that meets strict latency
and energy budgets. HyperDimensional Computing (HDC) offers a lightweight
alternative by encoding data as high-dimensional hypervectors and computing
with simple operations. Prior studies often assume that the qualitative
relation between HDC hyperparameters and performance is stable across
applications. Our analysis of two representative tasks, signal-based quality
monitoring in Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machining and image-based defect
detection in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF), shows that this assumption does
not hold. We map how encoder type, projection variance, hypervector
dimensionality, and data regime shape accuracy, inference latency, training
time, and training energy. A formal complexity model explains predictable
trends in encoding and similarity computation and reveals nonmonotonic
interactions with retraining that preclude a closed-form optimum. Empirically,
signals favor nonlinear Random Fourier Features with more exclusive encodings
and saturate in accuracy beyond moderate dimensionality. Images favor linear
Random Projection, achieve high accuracy with small dimensionality, and depend
more on sample count than on dimensionality. Guided by these insights, we tune
HDC under multiobjective constraints that reflect edge deployment and obtain
models that match or exceed the accuracy of state-of-the-art deep learning and
Transformer models while delivering at least 6x faster inference and more than
40x lower training energy. These results demonstrate that domain-aware HDC
encoding is necessary and that tuned HDC offers a practical, scalable path to
real-time industrial AI on constrained hardware. Future work will enable
adaptive encoder and hyperparameter selection, expand evaluation to additional
manufacturing modalities, and validate on low-power accelerators.

Abstract: The appearance of transformer-based models in Reinforcement Learning (RL) has
expanded the horizons of possibilities in robotics tasks, but it has
simultaneously brought a wide range of challenges during its implementation,
especially in model-free online RL. Some of the existing learning algorithms
cannot be easily implemented with transformer-based models due to the
instability of the latter. In this paper, we propose a method that uses the
Accelerator policy as a transformer's trainer. The Accelerator, a simpler and
more stable model, interacts with the environment independently while
simultaneously training the transformer through behavior cloning during the
first stage of the proposed algorithm. In the second stage, the pretrained
transformer starts to interact with the environment in a fully online setting.
As a result, this model-free algorithm accelerates the transformer in terms of
its performance and helps it to train online in a more stable and faster way.
By conducting experiments on both state-based and image-based ManiSkill
environments, as well as on MuJoCo tasks in MDP and POMDP settings, we show
that applying our algorithm not only enables stable training of transformers
but also reduces training time on image-based environments by up to a factor of
two. Moreover, it decreases the required replay buffer size in off-policy
methods to 10-20 thousand, which significantly lowers the overall computational
demands.

than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate
how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations
required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which
simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous
location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on
visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which
we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and
tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through
better management of simulations and combating redundancy.

Abstract: Alignment of large language models remains a central challenge in natural
language processing. Preference optimization has emerged as a popular and
effective method for improving alignment, typically through training-time or

decoding (AAD), a method to enhance model alignment directly at inference.
Theoretically, AAD can be interpreted as implicit reward optimization, yet it
requires no specialized training beyond the standard DPO setup. Empirically,
AAD consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse alignment
benchmarks and model scales. Moreover, in data-constrained settings, AAD can

Abstract: Mapping informal settlements is crucial for addressing challenges related to
urban planning, public health, and infrastructure in rapidly growing cities.
Geospatial machine learning has emerged as a key tool for detecting and mapping
these areas from remote sensing data. However, existing approaches often treat
spatial units independently, neglecting the relational structure of the urban
fabric. We propose a graph-based framework that explicitly incorporates local
geographical context into the classification process. Each spatial unit (cell)
is embedded in a graph structure along with its adjacent neighbors, and a
lightweight Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is trained to classify whether
the central cell belongs to an informal settlement. Experiments are conducted
on a case study in Rio de Janeiro using spatial cross-validation across five
distinct zones, ensuring robustness and generalizability across heterogeneous
urban landscapes. Our method outperforms standard baselines, improving Kappa
coefficient by 17 points over individual cell classification. We also show that
graph-based modeling surpasses simple feature concatenation of neighboring
cells, demonstrating the benefit of encoding spatial structure for urban scene
understanding.

Motivation: 传统神经算子模型依赖全局混合机制（如谱卷积或注意力），容易过度平滑局部动态且计算成本高。FINO旨在通过严格局部性和多尺度表示能力解决这些问题。

Method: FINO采用可学习的卷积核替代固定有限差分系数，并通过局部操作块（包含差分模板层、门控掩码和线性融合步骤）构建自适应局部特征。嵌入编码器-解码器结构，保留局部结构的精细性和可解释性。

Conclusion: FINO证明了严格局部性和可学习时间步进方案为神经PDE求解器提供了高效且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Neural operator models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs)
often rely on global mixing mechanisms-such as spectral convolutions or
attention-which tend to oversmooth sharp local dynamics and introduce high
computational cost. We present FINO, a finite-difference-inspired neural
architecture that enforces strict locality while retaining multiscale
representational power. FINO replaces fixed finite-difference stencil
coefficients with learnable convolutional kernels and evolves states via an
explicit, learnable time-stepping scheme. A central Local Operator Block
leverage a differential stencil layer, a gating mask, and a linear fuse step to
construct adaptive derivative-like local features that propagate forward in
time. Embedded in an encoder-decoder with a bottleneck, FINO captures
fine-grained local structures while preserving interpretability. We establish
(i) a composition error bound linking one-step approximation error to stable
long-horizon rollouts under a Lipschitz condition, and (ii) a universal
approximation theorem for discrete time-stepped PDE dynamics. (iii) Across six
benchmarks and a climate modelling task, FINO achieves up to 44\% lower error
and up to around 2\times speedups over state-of-the-art operator-learning
baselines, demonstrating that strict locality with learnable time-stepping
yields an accurate and scalable foundation for neural PDE solvers.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度学习的室内环境质量（IEQ）管理方法，通过比较LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种架构，优化了能源效率和舒适度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统HVAC系统在保证室内环境质量时能耗高，需要一种更智能的方法来平衡能源效率和舒适度。

Method: 利用ROBOD数据集，比较了LSTM、GRU和CNN-LSTM三种深度学习架构在不同时间范围内的预测性能。

Result: GRU在短期预测中表现最佳，CNN-LSTM适合长期预测，LSTM在长时间序列建模中表现稳健。

Conclusion: 研究为智能建筑管理系统提供了实用建议，通过预测性控制降低能耗并提升舒适度。

Abstract: Ensuring optimal Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is vital for occupant
health and productivity, yet it often comes at a high energy cost in
conventional Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems. This
paper proposes a deep learning driven approach to proactively manage IEQ
parameters specifically CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity while
balancing building energy efficiency. Leveraging the ROBOD dataset collected
from a net-zero energy academic building, we benchmark three
architectures--Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), and
a hybrid Convolutional Neural Network LSTM (CNN-LSTM)--to forecast IEQ
variables across various time horizons. Our results show that GRU achieves the
best short-term prediction accuracy with lower computational overhead, whereas
CNN-LSTM excels in extracting dominant features for extended forecasting
windows. Meanwhile, LSTM offers robust long-range temporal modeling. The
comparative analysis highlights that prediction reliability depends on data
resolution, sensor placement, and fluctuating occupancy conditions. These
findings provide actionable insights for intelligent Building Management
Systems (BMS) to implement predictive HVAC control, thereby reducing energy
consumption and enhancing occupant comfort in real-world building operations.

*Marcello Massimo Negri,Jonathan Aellen,Manuel Jahn,AmirEhsan Khorashadizadeh,Volker Roth*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Marginal Flow的框架，解决了现有密度建模方法的训练昂贵、推理慢、似然近似、模式崩溃或架构限制等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密度建模方法存在训练昂贵、推理慢、近似似然、模式崩溃或架构限制等不足，需要一种更高效灵活的解决方案。

Method: 通过定义参数化分布$q(x|w)$和潜在参数$w$，并采样$w$从可学习分布$q_\theta(w)$中，实现潜在变量的边缘化。

Result: Marginal Flow支持精确密度评估，训练和推理速度显著快于竞争模型，且具有灵活性，适用于多种任务。

Conclusion: Marginal Flow是一种高效、灵活的密度建模框架，适用于多种复杂任务。

Abstract: Current density modeling approaches suffer from at least one of the following
shortcomings: expensive training, slow inference, approximate likelihood, mode
collapse or architectural constraints like bijective mappings. We propose a
simple yet powerful framework that overcomes these limitations altogether. We
define our model $q_\theta(x)$ through a parametric distribution $q(x|w)$ with
latent parameters $w$. Instead of directly optimizing the latent variables $w$,
our idea is to marginalize them out by sampling $w$ from a learnable
distribution $q_\theta(w)$, hence the name Marginal Flow. In order to evaluate
the learned density $q_\theta(x)$ or to sample from it, we only need to draw
samples from $q_\theta(w)$, which makes both operations efficient. The proposed
model allows for exact density evaluation and is orders of magnitude faster
than competing models both at training and inference. Furthermore, Marginal
Flow is a flexible framework: it does not impose any restrictions on the neural
network architecture, it enables learning distributions on lower-dimensional
manifolds (either known or to be learned), it can be trained efficiently with
any objective (e.g. forward and reverse KL divergence), and it easily handles
multi-modal targets. We evaluate Marginal Flow extensively on various tasks
including synthetic datasets, simulation-based inference, distributions on
positive definite matrices and manifold learning in latent spaces of images.

TL;DR: TFPI是一种简单有效的RLVR改进方法，通过减少推理时的token使用，提升性能并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RLVR训练中长上下文需求导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 引入ThinkFree操作，通过直接丢弃思考内容减少token使用。

Result: TFPI加速RL收敛，提高性能上限，并减少token消耗。

Conclusion: TFPI是一种高效且无需复杂设计的RLVR改进方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) effectively solves
complex tasks but demands extremely long context lengths during training,
leading to substantial computational costs. While multi-stage training can
partially mitigate this, starting with overly short contexts often causes
irreversible performance degradation, ultimately failing to reduce overall
training compute significantly. In this paper, we introduce
**T**hinking-**F**ree **P**olicy **I**nitialization (**TFPI**), a simple yet
effective adaptation to RLVR that bridges long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
distillation and standard RLVR. TFPI employs a simple *ThinkFree* operation,
explicitly discarding the thinking content via a direct *</think>* append, to
reduce token usage during inference. Training with *ThinkFree*-adapted inputs
improves performance and lowers token consumption, even in the original
slow-thinking mode. Extensive experiments across various benchmarks have shown
that TFPI accelerates RL convergence, achieves a higher performance ceiling,
and yields more token-efficient reasoning models without specialized rewards or
complex training designs. With TFPI only, we train a 4B model to reach 89.0%
accuracy on AIME24 and 65.5% on LiveCodeBench using less than 4K H20 hours.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 锂电镀在快速充电过程中会加速容量衰减并引发安全隐患，现有检测方法因噪声放大和偏差问题不够可靠。

Method: 采用高斯过程框架直接建模Q(V)，利用GP的导数性质解析计算dQ/dV，实现无平滑处理的鲁棒检测。

Result: 实验验证表明，该方法在低温和高倍率充电条件下能可靠检测电镀峰，且与容量衰减结果一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时锂电镀检测提供了准确且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Lithium plating during fast charging is a critical degradation mechanism that
accelerates capacity fade and can trigger catastrophic safety failures. Recent
work has identified a distinctive dQ/dV peak above 4.0 V as a reliable
signature of plating onset; however, conventional methods for computing dQ/dV
rely on finite differencing with filtering, which amplifies sensor noise and
introduces bias in peak location. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) framework for lithium plating detection by directly modeling the
charge-voltage relationship Q(V) as a stochastic process with calibrated
uncertainty. Leveraging the property that derivatives of GPs remain GPs, we
infer dQ/dV analytically and probabilistically from the posterior, enabling
robust detection without ad hoc smoothing. The framework provides three key
benefits: (i) noise-aware inference with hyperparameters learned from data,
(ii) closed-form derivatives with credible intervals for uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) scalability to online variants suitable for embedded
BMS. Experimental validation on Li-ion coin cells across a range of C-rates
(0.2C-1C) and temperatures (0-40\deg C) demonstrates that the GP-based method
reliably detects plating peaks under low-temperature, high-rate charging, while
correctly reporting no peaks in baseline cases. The concurrence of
GP-identified differential peaks, reduced charge throughput, and capacity fade
measured via reference performance tests confirms the method's accuracy and
robustness, establishing a practical pathway for real-time lithium plating
detection.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态激活监控方法TPCs，通过逐步评估多项式项实现灵活的安全监控，节省资源并提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统安全监控器对所有查询使用相同计算量，导致资源浪费或漏检，需要灵活调整计算成本。

Method: 引入截断多项式分类器（TPCs），支持逐步训练和评估，可根据输入难度动态调整计算量。

Result: 在多个大规模安全数据集上，TPCs性能优于或媲美相同规模的MLP探针基线，且更具可解释性。

Conclusion: TPCs提供灵活的安全监控方案，适用于不同计算资源需求，同时保持高性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Monitoring large language models' (LLMs) activations is an effective way to
detect harmful requests before they lead to unsafe outputs. However,
traditional safety monitors often require the same amount of compute for every
query. This creates a trade-off: expensive monitors waste resources on easy
inputs, while cheap ones risk missing subtle cases. We argue that safety
monitors should be flexible--costs should rise only when inputs are difficult
to assess, or when more compute is available. To achieve this, we introduce
Truncated Polynomial Classifiers (TPCs), a natural extension of linear probes
for dynamic activation monitoring. Our key insight is that polynomials can be
trained and evaluated progressively, term-by-term. At test-time, one can
early-stop for lightweight monitoring, or use more terms for stronger
guardrails when needed. TPCs provide two modes of use. First, as a safety dial:
by evaluating more terms, developers and regulators can "buy" stronger
guardrails from the same model. Second, as an adaptive cascade: clear cases
exit early after low-order checks, and higher-order guardrails are evaluated
only for ambiguous inputs, reducing overall monitoring costs. On two
large-scale safety datasets (WildGuardMix and BeaverTails), for 4 models with
up to 30B parameters, we show that TPCs compete with or outperform MLP-based
probe baselines of the same size, all the while being more interpretable than
their black-box counterparts. Our code is available at

Motivation: 评估前沿AI系统的安全性至关重要，但AI可能故意隐藏危险能力或表现不佳以通过评估，威胁评估的完整性。

Method: 基于生存多臂老虎机框架，构建了一个战略欺骗模型，并开发了统计测试方法。

Result: 理论证明最优理性代理会表现出sandbagging行为，仿真实验验证了统计测试的可靠性。

Conclusion: 为前沿模型评估提供了潜在的稳健统计方法。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of frontier AI systems is an increasingly important
concern, helping to measure the capabilities of such models and identify risks
before deployment. However, it has been recognised that if AI agents are aware
that they are being evaluated, such agents may deliberately hide dangerous
capabilities or intentionally demonstrate suboptimal performance in
safety-related tasks in order to be released and to avoid being deactivated or
retrained. Such strategic deception - often known as "sandbagging" - threatens
to undermine the integrity of safety evaluations. For this reason, it is of
value to identify methods that enable us to distinguish behavioural patterns
that demonstrate a true lack of capability from behavioural patterns that are
consistent with sandbagging. In this paper, we develop a simple model of
strategic deception in sequential decision-making tasks, inspired by the
recently developed survival bandit framework. We demonstrate theoretically that
this problem induces sandbagging behaviour in optimal rational agents, and
construct a statistical test to distinguish between sandbagging and
incompetence from sequences of test scores. In simulation experiments, we
investigate the reliability of this test in allowing us to distinguish between
such behaviours in bandit models. This work aims to establish a potential
avenue for developing robust statistical procedures for use in the science of
frontier model evaluations.

TL;DR: AC-RL通过交互训练视觉模型生成更全面的文本描述，提升视觉数学推理的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型生成的文本描述常忽略推理所需的关键细节，导致推理失败。

Method: 提出AC-RL方法，通过交互中的澄清请求识别信息缺口，优化初始描述。

Result: 在七个视觉数学推理基准上，AC-RL比基线模型平均准确率提高4.4分。

Conclusion: AC-RL证明无需显式标注，仅通过交互即可有效学习视觉语言接口。

Abstract: Recent text-only models demonstrate remarkable mathematical reasoning
capabilities. Extending these to visual domains requires vision-language models
to translate images into text descriptions. However, current models, trained to
produce captions for human readers, often omit the precise details that
reasoning systems require. This creates an interface mismatch: reasoners often
fail not due to reasoning limitations but because they lack access to critical
visual information. We propose Adaptive-Clarification Reinforcement Learning
(AC-RL), which teaches vision models what information reasoners need through
interaction. Our key insight is that clarification requests during training
reveal information gaps; by penalizing success that requires clarification, we
create pressure for comprehensive initial captions that enable the reasoner to
solve the problem in a single pass. AC-RL improves average accuracy by 4.4
points over pretrained baselines across seven visual mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, and analysis shows it would cut clarification requests by up to 39%
if those were allowed. By treating clarification as a form of implicit
supervision, AC-RL demonstrates that vision-language interfaces can be
effectively learned through interaction alone, without requiring explicit
annotations.

Motivation: 群体公平性指标在分布偏移下不稳定，影响审计可靠性。

Method: 利用Wasserstein距离构建分布鲁棒性框架，提出DRUNE估计器。

Result: ε-WDF在标准基准测试中表现出稳定的公平性评估能力。

Conclusion: 该框架为分布偏移下的群体公平性审计提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Group-fairness metrics (e.g., equalized odds) can vary sharply across
resamples and are especially brittle under distribution shift, undermining
reliable audits. We propose a Wasserstein distributionally robust framework
that certifies worst-case group fairness over a ball of plausible test
distributions centered at the empirical law. Our formulation unifies common
group fairness notions via a generic conditional-probability functional and
defines $\varepsilon$-Wasserstein Distributional Fairness ($\varepsilon$-WDF)
as the audit target. Leveraging strong duality, we derive tractable
reformulations and an efficient estimator (DRUNE) for $\varepsilon$-WDF. We
prove feasibility and consistency and establish finite-sample certification
guarantees for auditing fairness, along with quantitative bounds under
smoothness and margin conditions. Across standard benchmarks and classifiers,
$\varepsilon$-WDF delivers stable fairness assessments under distribution
shift, providing a principled basis for auditing and certifying group fairness
beyond observational data.

Method: 通过100多项控制实验，涵盖LLM预训练到视觉对齐的全流程，分析不同数据类别和模型规模的影响。

Result: 视觉推理能力主要由推理类数据（如代码、数学）驱动，而感知能力则广泛来源于多样文本。

Conclusion: 研究提出了一种基于语言预训练的有意培养视觉先验的方法，为下一代多模态LLMs铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), despite being trained on text alone,
surprisingly develop rich visual priors. These priors allow latent visual
capabilities to be unlocked for vision tasks with a relatively small amount of
multimodal data, and in some cases, to perform visual tasks without ever having
seen an image. Through systematic analysis, we reveal that visual priors-the
implicit, emergent knowledge about the visual world acquired during language
pre-training-are composed of separable perception and reasoning priors with
unique scaling trends and origins. We show that an LLM's latent visual
reasoning ability is predominantly developed by pre-training on
reasoning-centric data (e.g., code, math, academia) and scales progressively.
This reasoning prior acquired from language pre-training is transferable and
universally applicable to visual reasoning. In contrast, a perception prior
emerges more diffusely from broad corpora, and perception ability is more
sensitive to the vision encoder and visual instruction tuning data. In
parallel, text describing the visual world proves crucial, though its
performance impact saturates rapidly. Leveraging these insights, we propose a
data-centric recipe for pre-training vision-aware LLMs and verify it in 1T
token scale pre-training. Our findings are grounded in over 100 controlled
experiments consuming 500,000 GPU-hours, spanning the full MLLM construction
pipeline-from LLM pre-training to visual alignment and supervised multimodal
fine-tuning-across five model scales, a wide range of data categories and
mixtures, and multiple adaptation setups. Along with our main findings, we
propose and investigate several hypotheses, and introduce the Multi-Level
Existence Bench (MLE-Bench). Together, this work provides a new way of
deliberately cultivating visual priors from language pre-training, paving the
way for the next generation of multimodal LLMs.

Abstract: In recent years, Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has
garnered substantial interest for its efficacy in data-driven decision-making
under distributional uncertainty. However, limited research has explored the
application of DRO to address individual fairness concerns, particularly when
considering causal structures and sensitive attributes in learning problems. To
address this gap, we first formulate the DRO problem from causality and
individual fairness perspectives. We then present the DRO dual formulation as
an efficient tool to convert the DRO problem into a more tractable and
computationally efficient form. Next, we characterize the closed form of the
approximate worst-case loss quantity as a regularizer, eliminating the max-step
in the min-max DRO problem. We further estimate the regularizer in more general
cases and explore the relationship between DRO and classical robust
optimization. Finally, by removing the assumption of a known structural causal
model, we provide finite sample error bounds when designing DRO with empirical
distributions and estimated causal structures to ensure efficiency and robust
learning.

Conclusion: 随机插值方法为物理仿真提供了竞争性基准，并展示了不同生成模型框架的潜力。

Abstract: Generative models have recently emerged as powerful surrogates for physical
systems, demonstrating increased accuracy, stability, and/or statistical
fidelity. Most approaches rely on iteratively denoising a Gaussian, a choice
that may not be the most effective for autoregressive prediction tasks in PDEs
and dynamical systems such as climate. In this work, we benchmark generative
models across diverse physical domains and tasks, and highlight the role of
stochastic interpolants. By directly learning a stochastic process between
current and future states, stochastic interpolants can leverage the proximity
of successive physical distributions. This allows for generative models that
can use fewer sampling steps and produce more accurate predictions than models
relying on transporting Gaussian noise. Our experiments suggest that generative
models need to balance deterministic accuracy, spectral consistency, and
probabilistic calibration, and that stochastic interpolants can potentially
fulfill these requirements by adjusting their sampling. This study establishes
stochastic interpolants as a competitive baseline for physical emulation and
gives insight into the abilities of different generative modeling frameworks.

Abstract: We consider imitation learning in the low-data regime, where only a limited

We introduce Noise-Guided Transport (NGT), a lightweight off-policy method that
casts imitation as an optimal transport problem solved via adversarial
training. NGT requires no pretraining or specialized architectures,
incorporates uncertainty estimation by design, and is easy to implement and
tune. Despite its simplicity, NGT achieves strong performance on challenging

Result: 实验表明，超参数调优可将自动调优性能平均提升94.8%，且通过元策略可进一步优化超参数（平均提升204.7%）。

Conclusion: 超参数调优是提升自动调优研究和实践的有效手段。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is widely used to optimize
performance-critical applications across many scientific domains by finding the
best program variant among many choices. Efficient optimization algorithms are
crucial for navigating the vast and complex search spaces in auto-tuning. As is
well known in the context of machine learning and similar fields,
hyperparameters critically shape optimization algorithm efficiency. Yet for
auto-tuning frameworks, these hyperparameters are almost never tuned, and their
potential performance impact has not been studied.
  We present a novel method for general hyperparameter tuning of optimization
algorithms for auto-tuning, thus "tuning the tuner". In particular, we propose
a robust statistical method for evaluating hyperparameter performance across
search spaces, publish a FAIR data set and software for reproducibility, and
present a simulation mode that replays previously recorded tuning data,
lowering the costs of hyperparameter tuning by two orders of magnitude. We show
that even limited hyperparameter tuning can improve auto-tuner performance by
94.8% on average, and establish that the hyperparameters themselves can be
optimized efficiently with meta-strategies (with an average improvement of
204.7%), demonstrating the often overlooked hyperparameter tuning as a powerful
technique for advancing auto-tuning research and practice.

Conclusion: 两阶段对齐策略有效提升了EEG模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for EEG signals offer a promising path to
generalizable brain-computer interface (BCI) applications, but they often
suffer from misalignment between pretraining objectives and downstream tasks,
as well as significant cross-subject distribution shifts. This paper addresses
these challenges by introducing a two-stage alignment strategy that bridges the
gap between generic pretraining and specific EEG decoding tasks. First, we
propose NeuroTTT: a domain-specific self-supervised fine-tuning paradigm that
augments the foundation model with task-relevant self-supervised objectives,
aligning latent representations to important spectral, spatial, and temporal
EEG features without requiring additional labeled data. Second, we incorporate
test-time training (TTT) at inference, we perform (i) self-supervised test-time
training on individual unlabeled test samples and (ii) prediction entropy
minimization (Tent), which updates only normalization statistics to continually
calibrate the model to each new input on the fly. Our approach, which, to our
knowledge, is the first to unify domain-tuned self-supervision with test-time
training in large-scale EEG foundation models, yields substantially improved
robustness and accuracy across diverse BCI tasks (imagined speech, stress
detection, motor imagery). Using CBraMod and LaBraM as backbones, our method
pushes their performance to a markedly higher level. Results on three diverse
tasks demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming conventional fine-tuning and
adaptation methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: AGD是一种基于可解释性的解码策略，通过引导生成过程提高LLMs的指令遵循和事实准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解码方法在满足复杂指令和生成准确文本方面表现不佳，现有控制技术常降低输出质量。

Method: AGD通过选择对用户定义ROI具有最高归因的候选词来引导生成，支持灵活定义ROI。

Result: AGD显著提升指令遵循（如Llama 3.1成功率从66.0%增至79.1%）和事实准确性，减少幻觉。

Conclusion: AGD是一种多功能、可解释且有效的方法，可增强现代LLMs的可靠性。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to follow complex instructions
and generate factually accurate text is critical for their real-world
application. However, standard decoding methods often fail to robustly satisfy
these requirements, while existing control techniques frequently degrade
general output quality. In this work, we introduce Attribution-Guided Decoding
(AGD), an interpretability-based decoding strategy. Instead of directly
manipulating model activations, AGD considers a set of high-probability output
token candidates and selects the one that exhibits the highest attribution to a
user-defined Region of Interest (ROI). This ROI can be flexibly defined over
different parts of the model's input or internal components, allowing AGD to
steer generation towards various desirable behaviors. We demonstrate AGD's
efficacy across three challenging domains. For instruction following, we show
that AGD significantly boosts adherence (e.g., improving the overall success
rate on Llama 3.1 from 66.0% to 79.1%). For knowledge-intensive tasks, we show
that guiding generation towards usage of internal knowledge components or
contextual sources can reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy in
both closed-book and open-book settings. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive,
entropy-based variant of AGD that mitigates quality degradation and reduces
computational overhead by applying guidance only when the model is uncertain.
Our work presents a versatile, more interpretable, and effective method for
enhancing the reliability of modern LLMs.

Motivation: 实际优化问题中，针对单一问题多次尝试不同启发式方法的需求未被系统研究，现有策略分散且缺乏统一视角。

Method: 通过统一术语和框架，整合算法选择、参数调优、多启动和资源分配等策略，并建立分类法。

Result: 提出了一个系统化的分类框架，统一了分散的研究策略。

Conclusion: 该综述填补了单问题多尝试优化策略的系统性研究空白，为未来研究提供了统一视角和分类基础。

Abstract: In certain real-world optimization scenarios, practitioners are not
interested in solving multiple problems but rather in finding the best solution
to a single, specific problem. When the computational budget is large relative
to the cost of evaluating a candidate solution, multiple heuristic alternatives
can be tried to solve the same given problem, each possibly with a different
algorithm, parameter configuration, initialization, or stopping criterion. The
sequential selection of which alternative to try next is crucial for
efficiently identifying the one that provides the best possible solution across
multiple attempts. Despite the relevance of this problem in practice, it has
not yet been the exclusive focus of any existing review. Several sequential
alternative selection strategies have been proposed in different research
topics, but they have not been comprehensively and systematically unified under
a common perspective.
  This work presents a focused review of single-problem multi-attempt heuristic
optimization. It brings together suitable strategies to this problem that have
been studied separately through algorithm selection, parameter tuning,
multi-start and resource allocation. These strategies are explained using a
unified terminology within a common framework, which supports the development
of a taxonomy for systematically organizing and classifying them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法样本效率低，需要大量模型评估，成本高且不实用。

Method: 结合贝叶斯估计和随机优化，优先选择信息量大的点，减少评估次数。

Result: ACE在评估效率上优于现有方法，同时保持生成最小且可行变化的能力。

Conclusion: ACE是一种高效且实用的反事实解释生成方法。

Abstract: Counterfactual Explanations (CFEs) interpret machine learning models by
identifying the smallest change to input features needed to change the model's
prediction to a desired output. For classification tasks, CFEs determine how
close a given sample is to the decision boundary of a trained classifier.
Existing methods are often sample-inefficient, requiring numerous evaluations
of a black-box model -- an approach that is both costly and impractical when
access to the model is limited. We propose Adaptive sampling for Counterfactual
Explanations (ACE), a sample-efficient algorithm combining Bayesian estimation
and stochastic optimization to approximate the decision boundary with fewer
queries. By prioritizing informative points, ACE minimizes evaluations while
generating accurate and feasible CFEs. Extensive empirical results show that
ACE achieves superior evaluation efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
methods, while maintaining effectiveness in identifying minimal and actionable
changes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义信息瓶颈（GIB）框架，通过协同信息重新定义原始IB原则，解决了其理论模糊性和估计难题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原始信息瓶颈（IB）原则在神经网络学习中有理论价值，但存在理论模糊性和估计困难，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过协同信息（即联合处理特征获得的信息）重新定义IB，提出GIB框架，并基于平均交互信息（II）提供可计算的协同定义。

Result: GIB在完美估计情况下上界原始IB，实验显示GIB在多种架构中表现一致，且更符合对抗鲁棒性的理解。

Conclusion: GIB不仅兼容现有IB理论，还解决了其局限性，为神经网络学习提供了更实用的理论框架。

Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers a compelling theoretical
framework to understand how neural networks (NNs) learn. However, its practical
utility has been constrained by unresolved theoretical ambiguities and
significant challenges in accurate estimation. In this paper, we present a
\textit{Generalized Information Bottleneck (GIB)} framework that reformulates
the original IB principle through the lens of synergy, i.e., the information
obtainable only through joint processing of features. We provide theoretical
and empirical evidence demonstrating that synergistic functions achieve
superior generalization compared to their non-synergistic counterparts.
Building on these foundations we re-formulate the IB using a computable
definition of synergy based on the average interaction information (II) of each
feature with those remaining. We demonstrate that the original IB objective is
upper bounded by our GIB in the case of perfect estimation, ensuring
compatibility with existing IB theory while addressing its limitations. Our
experimental results demonstrate that GIB consistently exhibits compression
phases across a wide range of architectures (including those with \textit{ReLU}
activations where the standard IB fails), while yielding interpretable dynamics
in both CNNs and Transformers and aligning more closely with our understanding
of adversarial robustness.

Motivation: Muon在训练神经网络时比现有自适应优化方法（如Adam）更快，但其在联邦学习中的直接应用会导致不收敛问题。

Method: 提出FedMuon方法，通过解决LMO的偏差问题，并分析近似求解LMO对收敛速度的影响。

Result: 实验表明，FedMuon在联邦学习中优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: FedMuon能有效解决Muon在联邦学习中的收敛问题，并在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Recently, a new optimization method based on the linear minimization oracle
(LMO), called Muon, has been attracting increasing attention since it can train
neural networks faster than existing adaptive optimization methods, such as
Adam. In this paper, we study how Muon can be utilized in federated learning.
We first show that straightforwardly using Muon as the local optimizer of
FedAvg does not converge to the stationary point since the LMO is a biased
operator. We then propose FedMuon which can mitigate this issue. We also
analyze how solving the LMO approximately affects the convergence rate and find
that, surprisingly, FedMuon can converge for any number of Newton-Schulz
iterations, while it can converge faster as we solve the LMO more accurately.
Through experiments, we demonstrated that FedMuon can outperform the
state-of-the-art federated learning methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于记忆驱动的自改进框架，结合LLM的通用知识与领域特定经验，提升序列决策任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的广泛但通用知识在特定决策任务中不足，需结合领域特定数据以提高适应性。

Method: 通过记忆存储过去交互和Q值，结合LLM先验知识进行自改进，相互强化。

Result: 在ALFWorld任务中，性能提升40%（已知任务）和75%（未知任务）。

Conclusion: 记忆驱动框架有效结合LLM与领域知识，显著提升决策任务性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as effective action policies for
sequential decision-making (SDM) tasks due to their extensive prior knowledge.
However, this broad yet general knowledge is often insufficient for specific
decision-making tasks with limited task-related data, making it challenging to
efficiently adapt LLMs to specific SDM tasks. To address this challenge, we
propose a memory-driven self-improvement framework that combines LLM general
prior knowledge with a compact memory of domain-specific experiences. Memory
retains past interactions and associated Q-values, thereby capturing
decision-relevant knowledge that facilitates accurate value estimation and
informs the LLM prior refinement. The refined LLM prior, in turn, generates
higher-reward trajectories that further enrich memory, forming a natural
self-improvement framework where memory and LLM prior mutually reinforce each
other. Experiments show that our memory-driven approach significantly
outperforms both traditional RL and LLM-based baselines, e.g., improving
performance by over 40\% on in-distribution tasks and over 75\% when
generalized to unseen tasks in ALFWorld.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有急诊和群体伤亡事件（MCI）分诊研究缺乏公开可用的可复现基准，限制了研究的可及性。

Method: 通过LLM辅助构建基准，包括数据预处理、特征协调和模式对齐，并定义两种场景（医院丰富资源和MCI模拟）。

Result: 提供了基线模型和SHAP可解释性分析，展示了不同场景下的预测差异和关键特征。

Conclusion: 这些贡献使分诊预测研究更具可复现性和可及性，推动了临床AI数据集的民主化。

Abstract: Research on emergency and mass casualty incident (MCI) triage has been
limited by the absence of openly usable, reproducible benchmarks. Yet these
scenarios demand rapid identification of the patients most in need, where
accurate deterioration prediction can guide timely interventions. While the
MIMIC-IV-ED database is openly available to credentialed researchers,
transforming it into a triage-focused benchmark requires extensive
preprocessing, feature harmonization, and schema alignment -- barriers that
restrict accessibility to only highly technical users.
  We address these gaps by first introducing an open, LLM-assisted emergency
triage benchmark for deterioration prediction (ICU transfer, in-hospital
mortality). The benchmark then defines two regimes: (i) a hospital-rich setting
with vitals, labs, notes, chief complaints, and structured observations, and
(ii) an MCI-like field simulation limited to vitals, observations, and notes.
Large language models (LLMs) contributed directly to dataset construction by
(i) harmonizing noisy fields such as AVPU and breathing devices, (ii)
prioritizing clinically relevant vitals and labs, and (iii) guiding schema
alignment and efficient merging of disparate tables.
  We further provide baseline models and SHAP-based interpretability analyses,
illustrating predictive gaps between regimes and the features most critical for
triage. Together, these contributions make triage prediction research more
reproducible and accessible -- a step toward dataset democratization in
clinical AI.

Result: 在合成问题上验证了有效性，成功学习多模态分布间的传输。

Conclusion: 新算法在数据到能量IPF中表现优异，并改进了现有数据到数据算法。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger bridge problem is concerned with finding a stochastic
dynamical system bridging two marginal distributions that minimises a certain
transportation cost. This problem, which represents a generalisation of optimal
transport to the stochastic case, has received attention due to its connections
to diffusion models and flow matching, as well as its applications in the
natural sciences. However, all existing algorithms allow to infer such dynamics
only for cases where samples from both distributions are available. In this
paper, we propose the first general method for modelling Schr\"odinger bridges
when one (or both) distributions are given by their unnormalised densities,
with no access to data samples. Our algorithm relies on a generalisation of the
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) procedure to the data-free case, inspired
by recent developments in off-policy reinforcement learning for training of
diffusion samplers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed data-to-energy
IPF on synthetic problems, finding that it can successfully learn transports
between multimodal distributions. As a secondary consequence of our
reinforcement learning formulation, which assumes a fixed time discretisation
scheme for the dynamics, we find that existing data-to-data Schr\"odinger
bridge algorithms can be substantially improved by learning the diffusion
coefficient of the dynamics. Finally, we apply the newly developed algorithm to
the problem of sampling posterior distributions in latent spaces of generative
models, thus creating a data-free image-to-image translation method. Code:

Result: 在Practical Molecular Optimization基准测试中达到新SOTA，并在先导化合物优化中获得更高的对接分数。

Conclusion: InVirtuoGen为药物发现提供了多功能生成基础，并开源了预训练模型和代码。

Abstract: We introduce InVirtuoGen, a discrete flow generative model for fragmented
SMILES for de novo and fragment-constrained generation, and
target-property/lead optimization of small molecules. The model learns to
transform a uniform source over all possible tokens into the data distribution.
Unlike masked models, its training loss accounts for predictions on all
sequence positions at every denoising step, shifting the generation paradigm
from completion to refinement, and decoupling the number of sampling steps from
the sequence length. For \textit{de novo} generation, InVirtuoGen achieves a
stronger quality-diversity pareto frontier than prior fragment-based models and
competitive performance on fragment-constrained tasks. For property and lead
optimization, we propose a hybrid scheme that combines a genetic algorithm with
a Proximal Property Optimization fine-tuning strategy adapted to discrete
flows. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Practical Molecular
Optimization benchmark, measured by top-10 AUC across tasks, and yields higher
docking scores in lead optimization than previous baselines. InVirtuoGen thus
establishes a versatile generative foundation for drug discovery, from early
hit finding to multi-objective lead optimization. We further contribute to open
science by releasing pretrained checkpoints and code, making our results fully
reproducible\footnote{https://github.com/invirtuolabs/InVirtuoGen_results}.

Motivation: 揭示梯度上升方法在机器遗忘中的失败原因，强调遗忘集与保留集之间的统计依赖性。

Method: 通过理论和实验分析，探讨梯度上升方法在机器遗忘中的表现，尤其是依赖关系的影响。

Result: 遗忘集与保留集的依赖导致梯度上升方法无法有效遗忘，甚至可能比原模型更差。

Conclusion: 统计依赖性是梯度上升方法在机器遗忘中失败的关键原因，需重新审视其适用性。

Abstract: Contrary to common belief, we show that gradient ascent-based unconstrained
optimization methods frequently fail to perform machine unlearning, a
phenomenon we attribute to the inherent statistical dependence between the
forget and retain data sets. This dependence, which can manifest itself even as
simple correlations, undermines the misconception that these sets can be
independently manipulated during unlearning. We provide empirical and
theoretical evidence showing these methods often fail precisely due to this
overlooked relationship. For random forget sets, this dependence means that
degrading forget set metrics (which, for a retrained model, should mirror test
set metrics) inevitably harms overall test performance. Going beyond random
sets, we consider logistic regression as an instructive example where a
critical failure mode emerges: inter-set dependence causes gradient
descent-ascent iterations to progressively diverge from the ideal retrained
model. Strikingly, these methods can converge to solutions that are not only
far from the retrained ideal but are potentially even further from it than the
original model itself, rendering the unlearning process actively detrimental. A
toy example further illustrates how this dependence can trap models in inferior
local minima, inescapable via finetuning. Our findings highlight that the
presence of such statistical dependencies, even when manifest only as
correlations, can be sufficient for ascent-based unlearning to fail. Our
theoretical insights are corroborated by experiments on complex neural
networks, demonstrating that these methods do not perform as expected in
practice due to this unaddressed statistical interplay.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应块大小调度器AdaBlock-dLLM，解决了传统半自回归解码中固定块大小的两个局限性，显著提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统半自回归解码采用固定块大小，存在延迟解码和过早解码错误的问题，限制了性能。

Method: 通过分析去噪过程中的置信度动态，提出波动带（VB）概念，并设计自适应块大小调度器AdaBlock-dLLM。

Result: 实验表明，AdaBlock-dLLM在相同吞吐量下准确率提升高达5.3%。

Conclusion: 自适应调度和置信度分析为未来dLLM训练策略提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are gaining attention for their
inherent capacity for parallel decoding, offering a compelling alternative to
autoregressive LLMs. Among various decoding strategies, blockwise
semi-autoregressive (semi-AR) approaches are widely adopted due to their
natural support for KV caching and their favorable accuracy-speed trade-off.
However, this paper identifies two fundamental limitations in the conventional
semi-AR decoding approach that applies a fixed block size: i) late decoding
overhead, where the unmasking of high-confidence tokens outside the current
block is unnecessarily delayed, and ii) premature decoding error, where
low-confidence tokens inside the current block are committed too early, leading
to incorrect tokens. This paper presents the first systematic investigation
challenging the fixed block size assumption in semi-AR decoding. Through a
statistical analysis of confidence dynamics during the denoising process, we
identify a volatility band (VB) region during dLLM decoding, which encodes
local semantic structure and can be used to guide adaptive block sizing.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce AdaBlock-dLLM, a training-free,
plug-and-play scheduler that adaptively aligns block boundaries with semantic
steps by adjusting block size during runtime. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks show that AdaBlock-dLLM achieves up to 5.3% accuracy
improvement under the same throughput budget. Beyond inference-time
optimization, we hope our semantics-aware adaptive scheduling approach and
confidence-based analysis will inspire future training strategies for dLLMs.

Motivation: 高风险的AI系统需要透明、可解释和可审计的决策，但现有方法（如CART）仅适用于结构化数据，而LLMs的提示策略缺乏可信行为保障。

Method: ACT将决策树的每个分裂点设计为自然语言问题，并通过基于不纯度的评估和LLM反馈（TextGrad）优化。

Result: 在文本基准测试中，ACT表现优于或与基于提示的基线相当，同时生成透明且可解释的决策路径。

Conclusion: ACT为处理非结构化数据提供了一种透明且可解释的决策树方法，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: When used in high-stakes settings, AI systems are expected to produce
decisions that are transparent, interpretable, and auditable, a requirement
increasingly expected by regulations. Decision trees such as CART provide clear
and verifiable rules, but they are restricted to structured tabular data and
cannot operate directly on unstructured inputs such as text. In practice, large
language models (LLMs) are widely used for such data, yet prompting strategies
such as chain-of-thought or prompt optimization still rely on free-form
reasoning, limiting their ability to ensure trustworthy behaviors. We present
the Agentic Classification Tree (ACT), which extends decision-tree methodology
to unstructured inputs by formulating each split as a natural-language
question, refined through impurity-based evaluation and LLM feedback via
TextGrad. Experiments on text benchmarks show that ACT matches or surpasses
prompting-based baselines while producing transparent and interpretable
decision paths.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原Robbins-Siegmund定理要求零阶项可和，但在许多强化学习应用中无法满足，因此需要扩展。

Method: 引入新的假设条件，结合平方可和条件，证明几乎必然收敛到有界集。

Result: 提供了几乎必然收敛速率、高概率浓度界和L^p收敛速率，并应用于Q-learning。

Conclusion: 扩展后的定理为强化学习算法提供了更广泛的收敛性分析工具。

Abstract: The Robbins-Siegmund theorem establishes the convergence of stochastic
processes that are almost supermartingales and is foundational for analyzing a
wide range of stochastic iterative algorithms in stochastic approximation and
reinforcement learning (RL). However, its original form has a significant
limitation as it requires the zero-order term to be summable. In many important
RL applications, this summable condition, however, cannot be met. This
limitation motivates us to extend the Robbins-Siegmund theorem for almost
supermartingales where the zero-order term is not summable but only square
summable. Particularly, we introduce a novel and mild assumption on the
increments of the stochastic processes. This together with the square summable
condition enables an almost sure convergence to a bounded set. Additionally, we
further provide almost sure convergence rates, high probability concentration
bounds, and $L^p$ convergence rates. We then apply the new results in
stochastic approximation and RL. Notably, we obtain the first almost sure
convergence rate, the first high probability concentration bound, and the first
$L^p$ convergence rate for $Q$-learning with linear function approximation.

Conclusion: fev-bench填补了现有基准测试的不足，为时间序列预测提供了更全面和严谨的评估工具。

Abstract: Benchmark quality is critical for meaningful evaluation and sustained
progress in time series forecasting, particularly given the recent rise of
pretrained models. Existing benchmarks often have narrow domain coverage or
overlook important real-world settings, such as tasks with covariates.
Additionally, their aggregation procedures often lack statistical rigor, making
it unclear whether observed performance differences reflect true improvements
or random variation. Many benchmarks also fail to provide infrastructure for
consistent evaluation or are too rigid to integrate into existing pipelines. To
address these gaps, we propose fev-bench, a benchmark comprising 100
forecasting tasks across seven domains, including 46 tasks with covariates.
Supporting the benchmark, we introduce fev, a lightweight Python library for
benchmarking forecasting models that emphasizes reproducibility and seamless
integration with existing workflows. Usingfev, fev-bench employs principled
aggregation methods with bootstrapped confidence intervals to report model
performance along two complementary dimensions: win rates and skill scores. We
report results on fev-bench for various pretrained, statistical and baseline
models, and identify promising directions for future research.

Abstract: Vector quantization is common in deep models, yet its hard assignments block

quantization as adding an error vector that mimics the quantization distortion,
keeping the forward pass hard while letting gradients flow. We also present a
space-filling variant (SF-DiVeQ) that assigns to a curve constructed by the
lines connecting codewords, resulting in less quantization error and full
codebook usage. Both methods train end-to-end without requiring auxiliary
losses or temperature schedules. On VQ-VAE compression and VQGAN generation
across various data sets, they improve reconstruction and sample quality over
alternative quantization approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 等变神经网络在分子和几何数据学习中具有强归纳偏差，但依赖计算昂贵的专用张量操作。

Method: 提出一个框架，将现有张量场网络转换为局部规范化范式，并比较不同等变表示的理论复杂度、运行时间和预测准确性。

Result: 发布了tensor_frames包，基于PyTorchGeometric实现局部规范化，便于将等变性集成到标准消息传递神经网络中。

Conclusion: 该框架在保持等变性的同时显著提高了运行效率，为等变神经网络的广泛应用提供了便利。

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks offer strong inductive biases for learning from
molecular and geometric data but often rely on specialized, computationally
expensive tensor operations. We present a framework to transfers existing
tensor field networks into the more efficient local canonicalization paradigm,
preserving equivariance while significantly improving the runtime. Within this
framework, we systematically compare different equivariant representations in
terms of theoretical complexity, empirical runtime, and predictive accuracy. We
publish the tensor_frames package, a PyTorchGeometric based implementation for
local canonicalization, that enables straightforward integration of
equivariance into any standard message passing neural network.

*Xi Wang,James McInerney,Lequn Wang,Nathan Kallus*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAT的信号，用于检测和防止大型推理模型的过度思考问题，从而节省计算资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在长链推理中表现更好，但存在过度思考的问题，即在得到正确答案后仍继续推理，浪费计算资源。

Method: 通过引入停止思考标记（</think>）并监控后续标记的熵（EAT），设计了一种动态停止推理的规则。

Result: 在MATH500和AIME2025数据集上，EAT减少了13-21%的标记使用，且不影响准确性。

Conclusion: EAT是一种简单且高效的方法，能够自适应地分配计算资源，适用于黑盒设置。

Abstract: Large reasoning models show improved performance with longer chains of
thought. However, recent work has highlighted (qualitatively) their tendency to
overthink, continuing to revise answers even after reaching the correct
solution. We quantitatively confirm this inefficiency by tracking Pass@1 for
answers averaged over a large number of rollouts and find that the model often
begins to always produce the correct answer early in the reasoning, making
extra reasoning a waste of tokens. To detect and prevent overthinking, we
propose a simple and inexpensive novel signal -- Entropy After </Think> (EAT)
-- for monitoring and deciding whether to exit reasoning early. By appending a
stop thinking token (</think>) and monitoring the entropy of the following
token as the model reasons, we obtain a trajectory that decreases and
stabilizes when Pass@1 plateaus; thresholding its variance under an exponential
moving average yields a practical stopping rule. Importantly, our approach
enables adaptively allocating compute based on the EAT trajectory, allowing us
to spend compute in a more efficient way compared with fixing the token budget
for all questions. Empirically, on MATH500 and AIME2025, EAT reduces token
usage by 13 - 21% without harming accuracy, and it remains effective in black
box settings where logits from the reasoning model are not accessible, and EAT
is computed with proxy models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了TAP方法，通过两阶段自适应个性化解决联邦学习中模型个性化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在分散式训练中表现优异，但最终模型可能不适合每个客户的需求。现有研究较少关注如何通过多任务和多模态基础模型的微调实现个性化。

Method: 提出TAP方法，包括（i）利用客户端与服务器模型架构不匹配进行选择性替换操作，（ii）通过后联邦学习知识蒸馏捕获有益知识而不影响个性化。

Result: 实验证明TAP在多种数据集和任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: TAP有效解决了联邦学习中模型个性化不足的问题，并提供了服务器模型在模态-任务对架构下的收敛分析。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), despite demonstrating impressive capabilities in the
training of multiple models in a decentralized manner, has been shown to
produce a final model not necessarily well-suited to the needs of each client.
While extensive work has been conducted on how to create tailored personalized
models, called Personalized Federated Learning (PFL), less attention has been
given to personalization via fine-tuning of foundation models with multi-task
and multi-modal properties. Moreover, there exists a lack of understanding in
the literature on how to fine-tune and personalize such models in a setting
that is heterogeneous across clients not only in data, but also in tasks and
modalities. To address this gap in the literature, we propose TAP (Two-Stage
Adaptive Personalization), which (i) leverages mismatched model architectures
between the clients and server to selectively conduct replacement operations
when it benefits a client's local tasks and (ii) engages in post-FL knowledge
distillation for capturing beneficial general knowledge without compromising
personalization. We also introduce the first convergence analysis of the server
model under its modality-task pair architecture, and demonstrate that as the
number of modality-task pairs increases, its ability to cater to all tasks
suffers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed algorithm across a variety of datasets and tasks in comparison to a
multitude of baselines. Implementation code is publicly available at
https://github.com/lee3296/TAP.

Motivation: 随着关键基础设施的复杂性增加，电力系统成为网络攻击的高价值目标，尤其是新型的不稳定攻击，目前缺乏有效防护。

Method: 采用监督学习模型，结合改进的Prony分析（MPA）方法，用于检测不稳定攻击并触发防御机制。

Result: 在IEEE 14 Bus系统上的实验证明，MPA是一种有效的检测不稳定攻击的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为电力系统提供了一种低成本、高效的防御不稳定攻击的解决方案。

Abstract: Every year critical infrastructure becomes more complex and we grow to rely
on it more and more. With this reliance, it becomes an attractive target for
cyberattacks from sophisticated actors, with one of the most attractive targets
being the power grid. One class of attacks, instability attacks, is a newer
type of attack that has relatively few protections developed. We present a cost
effective, data-driven approach to training a supervised machine learning model
to retrofit load shedding decision systems in power grids with the capacity to
defend against instability attacks. We show a proof of concept on the IEEE 14
Bus System using the Achilles Heel Technologies Power Grid Analyzer, and show
through an implementation of modified Prony analysis (MPA) that MPA is a viable
method for detecting instability attacks and triggering defense mechanisms.

Motivation: 为了提供一种可解释的方法来衡量神经网络中数据点的相似性，并验证其在多任务问题和实际数据集（如ImageNet）中的有效性。

Method: 通过计算低损失参数扰动分布下的样本损失协方差矩阵，构建损失核，并在合成多任务问题和Inception-v1模型上进行验证。

Result: 在合成任务中，损失核能按任务分离输入；在ImageNet上，其结构与WordNet语义层次一致。

Conclusion: 损失核是一种实用的可解释性和数据归因工具。

Abstract: We introduce the loss kernel, an interpretability method for measuring
similarity between data points according to a trained neural network. The
kernel is the covariance matrix of per-sample losses computed under a
distribution of low-loss-preserving parameter perturbations. We first validate
our method on a synthetic multitask problem, showing it separates inputs by
task as predicted by theory. We then apply this kernel to Inception-v1 to
visualize the structure of ImageNet, and we show that the kernel's structure
aligns with the WordNet semantic hierarchy. This establishes the loss kernel as
a practical tool for interpretability and data attribution.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TASP是一种针对长上下文LLM的拓扑感知序列并行方法，通过分解拓扑和通信原语，显著提升通信效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Ring Attention在AlltoAll拓扑中通信效率低的问题。

Method: 利用现代加速器的拓扑分解和通信原语分解，提出TASP方法。

Result: 在NVIDIA H100和AMD MI300X系统上，TASP比Ring Attention快3.58倍。

Conclusion: TASP通过优化通信效率，显著提升了长上下文LLM的性能。

Abstract: Long-context large language models (LLMs) face constraints due to the
quadratic complexity of the self-attention mechanism. The mainstream sequence
parallelism (SP) method, Ring Attention, attempts to solve this by distributing
the query into multiple query chunks across accelerators and enable each Q
tensor to access all KV tensors from other accelerators via the Ring AllGather
communication primitive. However, it exhibits low communication efficiency,
restricting its practical applicability. This inefficiency stems from the
mismatch between the Ring AllGather communication primitive it adopts and the
AlltoAll topology of modern accelerators. A Ring AllGather primitive is
composed of iterations of ring-styled data transfer, which can only utilize a
very limited fraction of an AlltoAll topology.
  Inspired by the Hamiltonian decomposition of complete directed graphs, we
identify that modern accelerator topology can be decomposed into multiple
orthogonal ring datapaths which can concurrently transfer data without
interference. Based on this, we further observe that the Ring AllGather
primitive can also be decomposed into the same number of concurrent ring-styled
data transfer at every iteration. Based on these insights, we propose TASP, a
topology-aware SP method for long-context LLMs that fully utilizes the
communication capacity of modern accelerators via topology decomposition and
primitive decomposition. Experimental results on both single-node and
multi-node NVIDIA H100 systems and a single-node AMD MI300X system demonstrate
that TASP achieves higher communication efficiency than Ring Attention on these
modern accelerator topologies and achieves up to 3.58 speedup than Ring
Attention and its variant Zigzag-Ring Attention. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典影响函数在深度神经网络中应用时面临Hessian矩阵不可逆和高维参数空间的挑战。

Method: 通过局部贝叶斯影响函数（BIF）替代Hessian矩阵求逆，利用损失景观统计量，通过随机梯度MCMC采样估计。

Result: 该方法能够高效扩展到数十亿参数的神经网络，并在预测再训练实验中取得先进结果。

Conclusion: BIF是一种Hessian-free方法，能够捕捉参数间的高阶交互，适用于大规模神经网络。

Abstract: Classical influence functions face significant challenges when applied to
deep neural networks, primarily due to non-invertible Hessians and
high-dimensional parameter spaces. We propose the local Bayesian influence
function (BIF), an extension of classical influence functions that replaces
Hessian inversion with loss landscape statistics that can be estimated via
stochastic-gradient MCMC sampling. This Hessian-free approach captures
higher-order interactions among parameters and scales efficiently to neural
networks with billions of parameters. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results
on predicting retraining experiments.

Abstract: We introduce Panama, an active learning framework to train parametric guitar
amp models end-to-end using a combination of an LSTM model and a WaveNet-like

that are determined through an ensemble-based active learning strategy to
minimize the amount of datapoints needed (i.e., amp knob settings). Our
strategy uses gradient-based optimization to maximize the disagreement among
ensemble models, in order to identify the most informative datapoints. MUSHRA
listening tests reveal that, with 75 datapoints, our models are able to match
the perceptual quality of NAM, the leading open-source non-parametric amp
modeler.

Motivation: 胸主动脉瘤（TAA）的发病机制复杂，涉及多种机械和机械生物学因素，需要识别驱动疾病进展的相互作用因素。

Method: 使用有限元框架生成合成TAA模型，训练神经网络（如Deep Operator Networks、UNets等）预测病因，并比较不同数据格式的效果。

Result: UNet在所有数据格式中表现最佳，且结合几何和力学数据（扩张性和可扩张性）显著提高预测准确性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在TAA评估中结合几何和力学数据的重要性，为个性化治疗策略提供了支持。

Abstract: Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) arise from diverse mechanical and
mechanobiological disruptions to the aortic wall that increase the risk of
dissection or rupture. Evidence links TAA development to dysfunctions in the
aortic mechanotransduction axis, including loss of elastic fiber integrity and
cell-matrix connections. Because distinct insults create different mechanical
vulnerabilities, there is a critical need to identify interacting factors that
drive progression. Here, we use a finite element framework to generate
synthetic TAAs from hundreds of heterogeneous insults spanning varying degrees
of elastic fiber damage and impaired mechanosensing. From these simulations, we
construct spatial maps of localized dilatation and distensibility to train
neural networks that predict the initiating combined insult. We compare several
architectures (Deep Operator Networks, UNets, and Laplace Neural Operators) and
multiple input data formats to define a standard for future subject-specific
modeling. We also quantify predictive performance when networks are trained
using only geometric data (dilatation) versus both geometric and mechanical
data (dilatation plus distensibility). Across all networks, prediction errors
are significantly higher when trained on dilatation alone, underscoring the
added value of distensibility information. Among the tested models, UNet
consistently provides the highest accuracy across all data formats. These
findings highlight the importance of acquiring full-field measurements of both
dilatation and distensibility in TAA assessment to reveal the mechanobiological
drivers of disease and support the development of personalized treatment
strategies.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为条件奖励建模（CRM）的新方法，通过将LLM的推理过程建模为时间序列，解决了现有过程奖励模型（PRMs）中步骤间依赖性和奖励与最终结果对齐的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRMs无法捕捉推理步骤间的依赖关系，且奖励信号与最终结果对齐不佳，导致信用分配模糊和奖励黑客攻击问题。

Method: 提出CRM方法，将推理步骤的奖励不仅基于前序步骤，还明确与最终结果关联，通过条件概率规则捕捉因果关系。

Result: 实验表明，CRM在多种采样和强化学习方法中优于现有奖励模型，且对奖励黑客攻击更鲁棒。

Conclusion: CRM为增强LLM推理提供了原则性框架，解决了信用分配模糊问题，并实现了稳定的下游性能提升。

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have emerged as a promising approach to enhance
the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by guiding their
step-by-step reasoning toward a final answer. However, existing PRMs either
treat each reasoning step in isolation, failing to capture inter-step
dependencies, or struggle to align process rewards with the final outcome.
Consequently, the reward signal fails to respect temporal causality in
sequential reasoning and faces ambiguous credit assignment. These limitations
make downstream models vulnerable to reward hacking and lead to suboptimal
performance. In this work, we propose Conditional Reward Modeling (CRM) that
frames LLM reasoning as a temporal process leading to a correct answer. The
reward of each reasoning step is not only conditioned on the preceding steps
but also explicitly linked to the final outcome of the reasoning trajectory. By
enforcing conditional probability rules, our design captures the causal
relationships among reasoning steps, with the link to the outcome allowing
precise attribution of each intermediate step, thereby resolving credit
assignment ambiguity. Further, through this consistent probabilistic modeling,
the rewards produced by CRM enable more reliable cross-sample comparison.
Experiments across Best-of-N sampling, beam search and reinforcement learning
demonstrate that CRM consistently outperforms existing reward models, offering
a principled framework for enhancing LLM reasoning. In particular, CRM is more
robust to reward hacking and delivers stable downstream improvements without
relying on verifiable rewards derived from ground truth.

Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，量化机器学习模型预测的不确定性对可靠决策至关重要。现有不确定性量化理论主要集中在分类任务，回归任务中的扩展仍具挑战性。

Method: 基于CRPS、对数、平方误差和二次评分等适当评分规则，构建统一框架，并在参数假设下推导闭式表达式。

Result: 不确定性度量自然分解为偶然性和认知性成分，并涵盖了基于预测方差和微分熵的流行回归UQ度量。

Conclusion: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛评估为选择可靠的不确定性度量提供了指导。

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty of machine learning model predictions is essential
for reliable decision-making, especially in safety-critical applications.
Recently, uncertainty quantification (UQ) theory has advanced significantly,
building on a firm basis of learning with proper scoring rules. However, these
advances were focused on classification, while extending these ideas to
regression remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a unified UQ
framework for regression based on proper scoring rules, such as CRPS,
logarithmic, squared error, and quadratic scores. We derive closed-form
expressions for the resulting uncertainty measures under practical parametric
assumptions and show how to estimate them using ensembles of models. In
particular, the derived uncertainty measures naturally decompose into aleatoric
and epistemic components. The framework recovers popular regression UQ measures
based on predictive variance and differential entropy. Our broad evaluation on
synthetic and real-world regression datasets provides guidance for selecting
reliable UQ measures.

Result: RSA在不同任务、模型和规模上显著提升性能，使小模型达到与大模型竞争的水平。

Conclusion: RSA是一种高效的测试时扩展方法，结合聚合感知强化学习可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Test-time scaling methods improve the capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) by increasing the amount of compute used during inference to make a
prediction. Inference-time compute can be scaled in parallel by choosing among
multiple independent solutions or sequentially through self-refinement. We
propose Recursive Self-Aggregation (RSA), a test-time scaling method inspired
by evolutionary methods that combines the benefits of both parallel and
sequential scaling. Each step of RSA refines a population of candidate
reasoning chains through aggregation of subsets to yield a population of
improved solutions, which are then used as the candidate pool for the next
iteration. RSA exploits the rich information embedded in the reasoning chains
-- not just the final answers -- and enables bootstrapping from partially
correct intermediate steps within different chains of thought. Empirically, RSA
delivers substantial performance gains with increasing compute budgets across
diverse tasks, model families and sizes. Notably, RSA enables
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 to achieve competitive performance with larger reasoning
models, including DeepSeek-R1 and o3-mini (high), while outperforming purely
parallel and sequential scaling strategies across AIME-25, HMMT-25, Reasoning
Gym, LiveCodeBench-v6, and SuperGPQA. We further demonstrate that training the
model to combine solutions via a novel aggregation-aware reinforcement learning
approach yields significant performance gains. Code available at

Conclusion: AttnRL框架显著提升了PSRL的探索效率和推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown remarkable success in enhancing the
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Process-Supervised RL
(PSRL) has emerged as a more effective paradigm compared to outcome-based RL.
However, existing PSRL approaches suffer from limited exploration efficiency,
both in terms of branching positions and sampling. In this paper, we introduce
a novel PSRL framework (AttnRL), which enables efficient exploration for
reasoning models. Motivated by preliminary observations that steps exhibiting
high attention scores correlate with reasoning behaviors, we propose to branch
from positions with high values. Furthermore, we develop an adaptive sampling
strategy that accounts for problem difficulty and historical batch size,
ensuring that the whole training batch maintains non-zero advantage values. To
further improve sampling efficiency, we design a one-step off-policy training
pipeline for PSRL. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging mathematical
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior
approaches in terms of performance and sampling and training efficiency.

Conclusion: AccidentBench旨在揭示多模态模型的关键缺陷，推动开发更安全、更鲁棒且更符合现实安全挑战的模型。

Abstract: Rapid advances in multimodal models demand benchmarks that rigorously
evaluate understanding and reasoning in safety-critical, dynamic real-world
settings. We present AccidentBench, a large-scale benchmark that combines
vehicle accident scenarios with Beyond domains, safety-critical settings in air
and water that emphasize spatial and temporal reasoning (e.g., navigation,
orientation, multi-vehicle motion). The benchmark contains approximately 2000
videos and over 19000 human-annotated question--answer pairs spanning multiple
video lengths (short/medium/long) and difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard).
Tasks systematically probe core capabilities: temporal, spatial, and intent
understanding and reasoning. By unifying accident-centric traffic scenes with
broader safety-critical scenarios in air and water, AccidentBench offers a
comprehensive, physically grounded testbed for evaluating models under
real-world variability. Evaluations of state-of-the-art models (e.g.,
Gemini-2.5 Pro and GPT-5) show that even the strongest models achieve only
about 18% accuracy on the hardest tasks and longest videos, revealing
substantial gaps in real-world temporal, spatial, and intent reasoning.
AccidentBench is designed to expose these critical gaps and drive the
development of multimodal models that are safer, more robust, and better
aligned with real-world safety-critical challenges. The code and dataset are

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AI对数据扰动和对抗样本的敏感性，需在部署前进行鲁棒性评估，但传统方法需要访问训练和测试数据，可能威胁数据隐私。

Method: SPATA将数据实例投影到离散空间，生成统计模式表示，用于分析和比较，而不泄露原始数据。

Conclusion: SPATA通过透明数据卡和避免数据泄露，为更可信的AI提供了支持。

Abstract: Due to the susceptibility of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to data
perturbations and adversarial examples, it is crucial to perform a thorough
robustness evaluation before any Machine Learning (ML) model is deployed.
However, examining a model's decision boundaries and identifying potential
vulnerabilities typically requires access to the training and testing datasets,
which may pose risks to data privacy and confidentiality. To improve
transparency in organizations that handle confidential data or manage critical
infrastructure, it is essential to allow external verification and validation
of AI without the disclosure of private datasets. This paper presents
Systematic Pattern Analysis (SPATA), a deterministic method that converts any
tabular dataset to a domain-independent representation of its statistical
patterns, to provide more detailed and transparent data cards. SPATA computes
the projection of each data instance into a discrete space where they can be
analyzed and compared, without risking data leakage. These projected datasets
can be reliably used for the evaluation of how different features affect ML
model robustness and for the generation of interpretable explanations of their
behavior, contributing to more trustworthy AI.
