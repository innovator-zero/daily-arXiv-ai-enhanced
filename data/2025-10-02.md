### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模块SSUF和损失函数，用于提升高光谱图像超分辨率任务的空间分辨率和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱图像超分辨率任务中，传统深度学习模型难以同时恢复空间细节和保持光谱保真度。

Method: 结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取的SSUF模块，以及自定义的空间-光谱梯度损失函数。

Result: 在三个公开遥感数据集上验证了模型性能优越且复杂度降低。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和自定义损失函数有效提升了高光谱图像超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的多层次框架，用于描述图像和文本幻觉，并揭示其根源，以促进更有效的解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛使用导致幻觉问题（错误或荒谬的输出）亟需解决，但目前对其理解仍不完整且碎片化。

Method: 提出一个统一的多层次框架，结合任务和模态的交错方法，分析幻觉的根源。

Result: 研究发现幻觉常源于数据分布的规律性和模型继承的偏见。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发更鲁棒的生成式AI系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出RobustVLA方法，针对多模态扰动提升Vision-Language-Action模型的鲁棒性，实验显示显著优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅关注视觉扰动，忽略了动作、指令等多模态扰动，导致模型在实际部署中脆弱。

Method: 通过离线鲁棒优化和输入一致性增强，结合多臂老虎机算法自动识别最有害噪声。

Result: 在17种扰动下，RobustVLA比基线提升12.6%（pi0）和10.4%（OpenVLA），推理速度快50.6倍。

Conclusion: RobustVLA在多模态扰动下表现优异，尤其在真实机器人场景中效果显著。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC框架通过分析模型内在能力，优化指令调优数据，仅用5%数据即超越全数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令调优方法忽视模型内在能力，导致数据效率低下。

Method: 提出CADC框架，通过梯度轨迹发现内在能力，并基于能力平衡选择和分阶段排序数据。

Result: 仅用5%数据即超越全数据训练效果。

Conclusion: CADC验证了内在能力是模型学习的基础，为指令数据优化提供了新范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: C$^3$B是一个新的多文化、多任务和多语言的文化意识能力基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个QA对，用于评估MLLMs的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准在任务设计上缺乏难度，且缺少跨语言任务，同时使用单一文化的真实图像，导致评估过于简单。

Method: 提出C$^3$B基准，包含三个难度递增的任务：基础视觉识别、文化冲突理解和文化内容生成。

Result: 评估了11个开源MLLMs，发现其性能与人类表现存在显著差距。

Conclusion: C$^3$B为MLLMs的文化意识能力提供了挑战，鼓励未来研究提升这一能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，六种先进的文本到图像模型在生成医院相关职业图像时存在系统性性别偏见，不同模型表现各异，提示词对性别平衡有显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是揭示文本到图像模型在职业性别表现中的偏见问题，以促进更公平的AI设计。

Method: 通过设计特定提示词，生成100张图像，分析六种模型在五种医院职业和五种肖像修饰词下的性别表现。

Result: 结果显示所有模型均表现出性别刻板印象，但不同模型对提示词的敏感度差异显著。

Conclusion: 结论强调需要设计更公平的模型默认设置和用户引导，以减少生成AI中的职业性别偏见。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一种基于强化学习的提示词逆向框架，能够从少量示例图像中恢复其模板，显著降低了攻击成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示提示词交易中的安全风险，即提示词可能被窃取，从而威胁MLLM市场的安全。

Method: 采用强化学习方法，将模板窃取视为序列决策问题，并使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数。

Result: 在公开基准测试中，RLStealer达到最先进性能，攻击成本降至现有基线的13%以下。

Conclusion: 研究强调了提示词交易中的安全威胁，为MLLM市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EDCT是一种自动化验证方法，用于检测视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的自然语言解释（NLE）的忠实性，通过反事实测试揭示解释与预测之间的不匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型生成的解释可能听起来合理但不忠实，存在技术和治理风险，需要验证方法。

Method: EDCT通过解析NLE为可测试的视觉概念，生成反事实编辑，并计算反事实一致性分数（CCS）来验证VLM的忠实性。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM中，EDCT发现了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计结果。

Conclusion: EDCT是一种有效的自动化工具，可用于评估和提升VLM生成解释的忠实性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe框架通过分层解耦方法解决了MLLMs在高分辨率图像中因背景干扰导致的性能问题，显著提升了性能并减少了内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像中表现不佳是由于小物体识别困难，但研究发现主要问题是复杂背景干扰。

Method: 提出HiDe框架，包括Token-wise Attention Decoupling（TAD）和Layout-Preserving Decoupling（LPD），无需训练即可解耦关键信息与背景干扰。

Result: HiDe在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能（如V*Bench 92.1%），内存使用减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe通过解耦关键信息与背景干扰，显著提升了MLLMs在高分辨率图像中的性能，且高效节省资源。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [10] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FSDENet通过结合空间和频域信息，提升遥感图像分割的边界和灰度过渡区域的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像分割中因灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题。

Method: 采用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征，结合FFT和Haar小波变换整合全局和频域信息。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过双域协同显著提升了边界和灰度过渡区域的分割精度。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将自动驾驶重新定义为广义语言任务，提出Max-V1框架，通过单阶段端到端方式实现轨迹规划，性能提升30%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将轨迹规划任务重新定义为下一个路径点预测问题，利用VLM的生成能力简化自动驾驶流程。

Method: 采用单阶段端到端框架，结合统计建模的监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家示范中学习复杂驾驶策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到SOTA性能，提升30%，并在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Max-V1为自动驾驶基础行为提供了高效模型，为更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [12] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种端到端的设计空间探索（DSE）方法和框架，用于压缩卷积神经网络（CNN），解决了低秩分解（LRF）技术中的多个挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩分解（LRF）在压缩深度神经网络（DNNs）时面临诸多问题，如最优秩选择、设计空间大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等。

Method: 提出了一种基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，采用一次性微调过程，并整合了多种LRF技术，适用于所有类型的卷积层和全连接层。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上实现了显著的压缩效果，且精度损失最小，优于多种先进技术。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解决了LRF的现有问题，还通过整合多种技术提升了压缩效果，并已集成到TensorFlow 2.x中，便于实际应用。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Conclusion: 该方法为精益系统与AI技术融合提供了新范式，适用于不同规模的汽车工厂，显著提升持续改进能力。

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OIG-Bench是一个专注于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在One-Image Guide理解能力的基准测试，结果显示当前模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在One-Image Guide（结合文本、图像和符号的视觉格式）中的人类理解能力，填补现有研究的空白。

Method: 开发了半自动标注流程，利用多智能体协作生成初步图像描述，辅助人工构建图像-文本对，并评估了29个MLLMs。

Result: Qwen2.5-VL-72B表现最佳，准确率为77%，但所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面存在明显弱点。多智能体标注系统在图像描述生成上优于所有MLLMs。

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在复杂视觉-文本关系理解上仍有挑战，多智能体标注系统在数据集构建和高质量图像描述生成方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Result: 在多个地理空间推理基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Geo-R1为地理空间建模提供了可扩展且高效的推理优先方法。

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

### [16] [Enhancing Certifiable Semantic Robustness via Robust Pruning of Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00083)
*Hanjiang Hu,Bowei Li,Ziwei Wang,Tianhao Wei,Casidhe Hutchison,Eric Sample,Changliu Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元指标（USN）的神经网络剪枝方法，以提高模型的鲁棒性认证性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉和机器人应用中广泛使用，但其对语义变换扰动（如亮度和对比度）的鲁棒性认证面临过参数化的挑战。

Method: 通过分析神经元对输入扰动的稳定性和方差，提出USN指标，并基于此设计了一种剪枝方法，结合Wasserstein距离损失优化剪枝过程。

Result: 在具有挑战性的鲁棒关键点检测任务中，该方法在鲁棒性认证性能和效率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: USN指标和剪枝方法有效解决了过参数化问题，提升了模型的鲁棒性认证能力。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于传输的数学模型的HAD方法，通过SCDT域表示像素，并在该域中构建背景信号模型以检测异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于复杂环境和有限先验知识，现有HAD技术面临挑战，需要更有效的方法。

Method: 使用SCDT域表示像素，并采用无监督子空间建模技术构建背景信号模型。

Result: 在五个数据集上的评估表明，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在HAD任务中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LoRA的水印框架MOLM，用于生成模型的图像溯源，具有鲁棒性和高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有水印方法对失真、自适应移除和密钥更新的脆弱性问题。

Method: 通过密钥依赖的生成模型参数扰动，引入基于路由的MOLM框架，利用LoRA适配器实现水印嵌入。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上验证了MOLM的图像质量保持和鲁棒密钥恢复能力。

Conclusion: MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，实现了对多种攻击的鲁棒性，为生成模型的水印提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

TL;DR: CROWD框架通过组合数据发现和表示学习，显著提升开放世界目标检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有开放世界目标检测方法中已知与未知类别的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（最大化子模条件增益函数挖掘未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（组合目标解耦表示学习）。

Result: 在M-OWODB和S-OWODB基准上，已知类别准确率分别提升2.83%和2.05%，未知类别召回率提升近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合方法有效缓解了语义混淆和遗忘问题，显著提升了开放世界目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于离散小波变换（DWT）的ExpDWT-VAE方法，用于增强VAE在卫星图像中的潜在空间表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有许多研究改进潜在扩散模型（LDM），但针对潜在空间本身的改进研究较少。

Method: 通过双分支结构（空间域和频域处理）结合DWT，生成集成的空间-频率表示，并映射为潜在表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个性能指标上显著提升了潜在空间表示的效果。

Conclusion: ExpDWT-VAE为卫星图像的潜在空间表示提供了一种创新且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设理想观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角的感知噪声（如遮挡、ID切换等），导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出EgoTraj-Bench基准，结合BiFlow双流匹配模型，通过共享潜在表示同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动，并引入EgoAnchor机制建模意图。

Result: BiFlow在minADE和minFDE指标上平均降低10-15%，表现最优。

Conclusion: EgoTraj-Bench和BiFlow为真实世界的第一人称轨迹预测提供了鲁棒性基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Method: 在PneumoniaMNIST和Shenzhen TB数据集上对比CNN和BiomedCLIP，通过阈值校准优化VLM性能。

Result: 校准后，BiomedCLIP在肺炎检测中F1-score达0.8841（优于CNN的0.8803），结核病检测中从0.4812提升至0.7684。

Conclusion: 阈值校准是释放零样本VLM潜力的关键，可使其性能接近或超越监督模型。

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match
or even outperform efficient, task-specific supervised models.

Conclusion: PAL-UI 展示了主动记忆检索对基于视觉的 GUI 代理长时规划能力的潜力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑膜瘤的精确分割对放疗计划至关重要，但现有自动化方法因肿瘤异质性难以满足临床需求。

Method: 开发了Interactive-MEN-RT工具，结合多种临床交互方法（如点标注、边界框等），提升分割精度。

Result: 在500例MRI扫描中，Dice系数达77.6%，IoU达64.8%，优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 临床定制化分割工具在脑膜瘤放疗计划中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

Result: 在OpenS2V基准测试中，BindWeave在主体一致性、自然性和文本相关性上表现优异。

Conclusion: BindWeave显著提升了复杂场景下视频生成的主体一致性和质量。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

Motivation: 现有自监督去噪方法在保留高频细节和避免高频噪声学习方面存在不足。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了SCNet的有效性。

Conclusion: SCNet显著提升了自监督去噪的性能，尤其在保留高频细节方面表现突出。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates
noise and high-frequency details through frequency domain separation and
low-rank space reconstruction, to retain the high-frequency structural details
of images. Experiments performed on synthetic and real-world datasets verify
the effectiveness of SCNet.

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA能有效提升视觉语言对象检测器在域偏移下的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 首次在通用异常检测中混合使用正常和异常样本作为参考，提高了检测准确性和效率。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成先验的手部姿态优化方法，利用功能感知文本描述指导扩散模型，显著提升了严重遮挡下的手部姿态估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决手部严重自遮挡或被物体遮挡时的姿态估计问题，受人类利用上下文知识（如功能感知）启发。

Method: 使用扩散生成模型，结合大视觉语言模型推断的功能感知文本描述，优化遮挡区域的手部姿态。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集上，功能感知优化显著优于回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的扩散优化。

Conclusion: 功能感知文本指导的生成先验能有效提升遮挡情况下的手部姿态估计准确性和功能一致性。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

Motivation: 视觉令牌在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有方法压缩令牌但忽略了压缩带来的学习难度增加问题。

Method: 提出EPIC框架，通过令牌一致性和层一致性蒸馏，渐进学习以减少训练难度。

Result: 实验证明EPIC在效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力上表现优越。

Conclusion: EPIC通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了令牌压缩带来的学习挑战，提升了模型效率。

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个标准化的基准测试，用于评估超声心动图基础模型，整合了八个公开数据集，覆盖多种任务，并评估了不同模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型的应用缺乏标准化评估基准，且面临数据噪声、冗余和公开数据集有限等挑战。

Method: 引入CardioBench，整合八个公开数据集，评估多种基础模型在零样本、探测和对齐协议下的表现。

Result: 不同模型家族各有优势：时间建模对功能回归重要，检索在分布偏移下稳健，领域特定文本编码器能捕捉生理意义。通用编码器表现良好，但在细粒度任务上不足。

Conclusion: CardioBench为超声心动图基础模型提供了可复现的评估标准，并为未来模型设计提供了实用建议。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合概率建模与级联优化的手部3D姿态重建框架，通过两阶段扩散模型实现高精度重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部姿态带来的模糊性，而现有概率方法多为单阶段且缺乏优化。

Method: 采用两阶段扩散模型：第一阶段生成多样化的3D关节假设，第二阶段基于关节样本重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上达到最优性能，并能有效建模姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率建模与级联优化，显著提升了手部3D重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 林业环境中害虫检测面临目标微小、遮挡严重、背景复杂等挑战，传统检测模型难以应对。

Method: 结合SPD-Conv保留高分辨率细节，CSPOK增强多尺度特征融合，VarifocalLoss优化训练目标。

Result: 在自建数据集上，Forestpest-YOLO表现优于基线模型，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO为林业害虫检测提供了高效解决方案，解决了传统模型的局限性。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

TL;DR: 论文展示了数据高效的基础视觉模型在微生物学任务中，仅需少量标注数据即可与传统方法匹敌。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学任务依赖大量标注数据和长时间训练，本文旨在证明少量标注数据也能达到类似效果。

Method: 使用5000张标注的Petri dish图像，模拟传统、少样本和低样本场景，并对比三种基础视觉模型与传统方法。

Result: MaskDINO在仅150张图像微调下接近YoloV9性能，25张图像时仍保持70%可靠性。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能显著减少标注需求，加速自动化微生物系统的开发与迭代。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练主干，导致从单任务学习到多任务学习过渡时存在冗余适应和知识共享效率低的问题。

Method: 提出ASE方法，在LoRA-based MoE中引入共享专家，通过路由器计算的门控权重与稀疏专家联合归一化，并增加细粒度专家数量以提升知识共享效果。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，ASE在不同配置下均表现出性能提升，验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度设计，显著提升了多任务学习的性能和知识共享效率。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏灵活性。

Method: 提出Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)和时间解耦条件策略，支持任意时间戳和长度的插值。

Result: 在多种插值比例（2x至32x）下，ArbInterp在保真度和时空连续性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ArbInterp解决了现有方法的灵活性不足问题，实现了高质量的视频帧插值。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

Result: 在四个基准测试中，KeySG在语义丰富性和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层RAG管道和关键帧优化，实现了更通用的任务无关推理和规划。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为自动驾驶提供了校准、可解释且鲁棒的决策支持组件。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

Motivation: 现有NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息直接整合到原始NeRF流程中，导致内容保留和艺术风格化效果不佳。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，并设计动态风格注入模块自适应整合风格特征，最后通过多级级联解码器生成风格化视图。

Result: 实验表明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移中表现出色，能够保留多尺度空间结构并有效迁移风格特征。

Conclusion: MDS-NeRF通过创新的多级动态风格迁移方法，显著提升了3D风格迁移的性能和效果。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

Conclusion: ADPT为结构缺陷标注提供了高效、可扩展的解决方案，支持下游任务如迁移学习。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

Method: 通过语义增强的地标识别分离前景和背景特征，并采用共识驱动的在线增强策略，结合不同指令和导航位置的特征偏好。

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上，COFA提升了基线模型的泛化能力并达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 前景和背景特征的在线增强策略有效提升了VLN任务的性能。

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习容易导致模型过度依赖背景信息，牺牲上下文信息以提高泛化性。RCOR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，解耦对象和上下文建模，并通过非参数融合实现鲁棒性。

Result: RCOR在监督模型和VLM上均表现优异，适用于域内和域外背景数据集，无需微调。

Conclusion: RCOR证明了在复杂场景（如ImageNet-1k）中，定位先于识别是可行的。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无条件判别器（UCD）来改进GAN训练，解决了模式崩溃问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN训练中条件输入导致冗余捷径，阻碍知识提取，影响收敛和模式覆盖。

Method: 采用无条件判别器（UCD），避免条件注入，使判别器提取更全面和鲁棒的特征。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到1.47 FID，优于StyleGAN-XL和其他先进的一步扩散模型。

Conclusion: UCD通过促进纳什均衡，显著提升GAN训练效率和性能，且与经典GAN理论兼容。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Conclusion: 结合几何先验与网络学习过程的创新方法有效提升了深度伪造检测能力。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Conclusion: ReFlux成功评估了整流流框架中概念擦除的脆弱性，为未来安全研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Motivation: 薄云缺乏显著特征和训练样本质量低限制了深度学习方法的云检测精度，需要进一步改进。

Method: 使用渐进式训练框架训练多尺度场景级云检测网络，结合多尺度概率图和云厚度图生成像素级云概率图，并通过自适应阈值和距离加权优化获得二值云掩码。

Result: 在WDCD和GF1MS-WHU数据集上，SpecMCD方法的F1分数比WDCD和WSFNet等方法提高了7.82%以上。

Conclusion: SpecMCD方法在不同云覆盖条件下表现出优越性和潜力。

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Align Your Tangent (AYT)的方法，通过引入流形特征距离（MFD）损失函数，解决了Consistency Models (CMs)训练中切线振荡的问题，显著加速训练并提升样本质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Consistency Models (CMs)在扩散或概率流ODE轨迹上训练，能够实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批量以保持样本质量。研究发现CM切线振荡问题阻碍了训练效率。

Method: 提出流形特征距离（MFD）损失函数，使切线方向与数据流形对齐，从而减少振荡。该方法称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)。

Result: AYT显著加速CM训练，甚至超越LPIPS指标，且支持极小批量训练而不影响样本质量。

Conclusion: AYT通过优化切线方向，解决了CM训练的瓶颈，为高效高质量生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Method: 基于IRLS rPCA基线展开U2-rPCA，加入稀疏增强单元，无需学习标签，保留数学可解释性。

Result: 在仿真和公开数据集中，U2-rPCA优于SVD、rPCA基线和其他深度学习方法，功率多普勒图像的CNR提升2-10 dB。

Conclusion: U2-rPCA在性能、可解释性和适应性方面均优于现有方法，模块有效性通过消融研究验证。

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Conclusion: 该框架展示了领域适应方法在多场景下准确进行脑血管图像分割的潜力。

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Result: 实验表明，LMPPM在多个数据集上优于LDM，尤其在图像恢复和生成方面表现更优。

Conclusion: 该研究为生成模型提供了新的几何和概率统一视角，MPPM模型在性能上超越了现有方法。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

Conclusion: 尽管性能未达最优，但研究为多类别分割的紧凑编码策略提供了启发。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

Result: 实现了事件数据上的开放词汇目标检测，保留了关键时间信息。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了事件数据与图像模态差异问题，提升了开放词汇检测能力。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

*Sanghwan Kim,Rui Xiao,Stephan Alaniz,Yongqin Xian,Zeynep Akata*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的框架，利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为指导信号，提升细粒度多模态任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖复杂、任务特定的微调，限制了泛化性并增加了模型复杂性。

Method: 通过模型输出熵的变化评分候选视觉输入，使其自主聚焦于最显著的数据。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时间定位任务中，性能与专用微调方法相当。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是提升细粒度多模态性能的有效通用策略。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的无监督运动校正方法，显著提高了心血管磁共振（CMR）灌注成像的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了其鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用三步无监督深度学习管道，结合鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关影响，并对灌注序列和辅助图像进行对齐。

Result: 方法显著改善了时间强度曲线的平滑性，心肌对齐效果与基线相当且优于未配准状态，处理时间减少了15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道实现了快速、鲁棒的运动校正，有望促进定量灌注成像的临床广泛应用。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用低成本的EEG设备和12个通道即可实现高准确度的情绪预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性，而EEG提供更直接、无偏的数据源。低成本EEG设备的普及需要验证其有效性。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集中的EEG通道子集，通过连续小波变换将数据转换为尺度图，并用视觉变换器（ViT）模型进行情绪分类。

Result: 模型仅用12个通道即可达到91.57%的准确率预测4种情绪象限，接近32个通道的96.9%的先进水平。

Conclusion: 低成本EEG设备通过减少输入通道仍能实现高准确度的情绪预测，为实际应用提供了可行性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

TL;DR: 提出了一种分解极端盲图像恢复（EBIR）问题的新框架，通过中间低质量（LQ）流形映射和现成BIR模型实现高质量（HQ）恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BIR方法在极端退化（EBIR）下表现不佳，直接学习ELQ到HQ映射困难且易产生伪影。

Method: 框架包含一个投影器，将ELQ图像映射到中间LQ流形，再用现成BIR模型恢复为HQ。基于信息瓶颈理论设计训练目标。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在严重退化条件下有效，支持推理时快速优化和现有模型即插即用增强。

Conclusion: 通过分解恢复过程和信息理论驱动设计，解决了EBIR问题，提升了恢复效果和灵活性。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 陶瓷制造需要无损检测技术以确保组件质量，OCT技术能高分辨率成像内部缺陷。

Method: 开发基于U-Net架构的神经网络，结合手动标注的OCT图像训练，并优化实验配置。

Result: 系统表现优异，Dice Score达0.979，推理时间为18.98秒/体积，优于同类研究。

Conclusion: 该系统在检测缺陷方面高效可靠，支持自动化质量控制。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

TL;DR: MULTI-TAP是一个多目标任务感知预测器，用于评估图像-文本对齐，优于现有方法，并在效率和性能上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法缺乏全面性，无法同时满足人类判断对齐、长序列处理、高效推理和多目标评分等关键需求。

Method: 提出MULTI-TAP，基于大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）构建，通过轻量级岭回归层实现多目标评分。

Result: MULTI-TAP在性能和效率上优于现有方法，甚至与GPT-4o的G-VEval相当，且模型更小（7-8B）。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP和新数据集EYE4ALL为开发更可靠的视觉语言应用提供了基础，尤其适用于盲人和低视力用户。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用DNN的特征图生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法需要多次查询或训练扩散模型，限制了实际应用。

Method: 利用DNN的特征图添加到干净图像中，以干扰目标模型的分类。

Result: ZQBA能在不同模型和数据集（如CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet）上迁移对抗样本，且比单查询的先进攻击更有效。

Conclusion: ZQBA展示了DNN在实际应用中的脆弱性，同时保持了对抗样本的不可感知性。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概念瓶颈模型（CBMs）的新型不确定性感知和可解释分类器，通过二进制类级概念原型增强分类性能和不确定性传播。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBMs在图像分类中提供可解释性，但通常牺牲预测性能，且不确定性传播未被充分探索。

Method: 学习二进制类级概念原型，利用预测概念向量与原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量。

Result: 框架提高了可解释性和鲁棒性，支持对不确定或异常输入进行共形预测。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持可解释性的同时，提升了CBMs的分类性能和不确定性处理能力。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在输入提示有微小语言变化时难以保持语义一致性，暴露了模型在推理和泛化上的不足。

Method: MetaLogic利用变形测试，生成语义相同但语法不同的提示对，通过比较生成的图像对来识别不一致性。

Result: 测试显示，即使是SOTA模型如Flux.dev和DALLE-3，也分别有59%和71%的不一致率。

Conclusion: MetaLogic是一种高效、可扩展且无需真实图像的评估方法，能有效发现现有指标忽略的逻辑不一致问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative

artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.

Motivation: 现有自动AD生成方法主要针对短片段，且评估方式单一，忽略了AD的主观性。通过分析两个独立AD轨道，量化了AD的主观性，表明短片段评估不足。

Method: 提出ADQA基准，测试AD在几分钟长视频片段中的表现，包括视觉欣赏（VA）和叙事理解（NU）问题。

Result: 当前AD生成方法在ADQA中表现远不如人工AD。

Conclusion: 建议未来工作改进AD生成方法，并公开了ADQA的排行榜。

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in

in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance

TL;DR: NSARM是一种基于自回归模型的Real-ISR框架，通过两阶段训练实现高效且高质量的图像超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Real-ISR方法在生成质量或效率上存在不足，且对输入图像质量敏感。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：先训练转换网络生成初步尺度，再进行端到端微调。

Result: NSARM在视觉质量和推理速度上优于现有方法，且对输入质量更鲁棒。

Conclusion: NSARM展示了自回归模型在Real-ISR任务中的潜力，兼具高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Conclusion: 方法在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力，定量和定性结果均验证其有效性。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

TL;DR: 生成世界模型（WorldLMs）通过视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，提升视觉语言模型的多模态理解能力，尤其在空间推理和多帧推理方面表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生成世界模型在通用多模态任务中的潜力，弥补现有视觉编码器范式在系统研究上的不足。

Method: 利用视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，通过单步去噪生成视觉嵌入，构建WorldLMs模型（如DyVA）。

Result: DyVA在视觉推理任务中超越开源和专有基线，达到或接近最优性能，尤其在空间推理和多帧推理方面表现显著。

Conclusion: WorldLMs通过视频预训练继承运动一致性，为未来通用视觉学习模型的设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

Motivation: 传统RNN在视频超分辨率任务中存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer的二次复杂度限制了其在长序列中的应用。Mamba虽然高效，但缺乏空间依赖性建模能力。

Method: 提出混合架构，结合Mamba选择性扫描和移位窗口自注意力，并引入GSM机制进行特征对齐和传播。

Result: GSMamba有效减少了遮挡伪影，提升了长序列建模能力。

Conclusion: GSMamba结合了Mamba的高效性和自注意力的空间建模能力，为视频超分辨率任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Motivation: 传统方法将3D OCT体积压缩为2D报告会导致关键结构细节丢失，因此需要一种更有效的方法来保留和分析这些信息。

Method: 模型结合交叉注意力机制和3D CNN，通过分割体积并应用交叉注意力来捕捉视网膜区域的不对称性，同时整合视神经头和黄斑的信息。

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D在保持高诊断性能的同时，显著减少了参数数量，为青光眼诊断提供了高效且可解释的工具。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Motivation: 源数据集选择对算法泛化性和患者结果有重要影响，但目前依赖直觉而非系统原则。

Conclusion: 需明确定义和工具支持，以系统性选择源数据集。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

Motivation: 手动标注3D面部扫描的解剖标志耗时且依赖专业知识，现有深度学习方法多关注伪标志或需要复杂输入，限制了临床应用。

Method: PAL-Net结合粗对齐、兴趣区域过滤和基于注意力的点状CNN，通过训练214个健康成人扫描数据实现标志定位。

Result: 在健康成人数据上平均定位误差为3.686 mm，在FaceScape数据集上点误差为0.41 mm，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAL-Net提供了一种轻量级、可扩展的高通量3D人体测量分析解决方案，有望减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Motivation: 在监控场景中，不同摄像头距离导致行人图像分辨率差异显著，现有方法依赖超分辨率或联合学习，增加了复杂度且性能提升有限。

Result: 在多个CR-ReID基准测试中显著优于现有方法，同时效率更高。

Conclusion: 论文通过新发现的特征空间语义方向，提出了一种高效且有效的CR-ReID解决方案。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Result: InfVSR在长视频超分辨率中达到最优质量，速度提升58倍，并增强语义一致性。

Conclusion: InfVSR为长视频超分辨率提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案，填补了长视频评估的空白。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

Result: FastForward在最小地图准备时间内实现了最先进的精度，并能泛化到未见过的领域，包括大规模户外环境。

Conclusion: FastForward提供了一种高效且准确的视觉定位方法，适用于快速部署和跨领域应用。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

Result: 实验表明，SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上达到自回归模型中的最佳FID。

Conclusion: SoftCFG是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，能无缝集成现有AR流程，有效提升生成质量。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

Conclusion: TextCAM通过文本增强的视觉解释，提升了人类理解和模型可信度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Conclusion: POVQA方法在视频问答任务中表现出色，且对不同池化方案具有强鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDoctor是一个多维度评估文本到图像（T2I）模型质量的框架，通过四个维度（合理性、语义对齐、美学和整体质量）和像素级热图提供反馈，显著优于单标量评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅用单一标量评估图像质量，无法提供全面且可解释的反馈，限制了T2I模型的优化。

Method: ImageDoctor采用“看-想-预测”范式，结合视觉语言模型和监督微调与强化学习，评估图像质量并提供热图反馈。

Result: ImageDoctor在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为奖励模型时生成质量提升10%。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor为T2I模型提供了更全面、可解释的评估和优化工具，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的高光谱对抗训练方法AT-RA，通过数据增强和空间平滑性提升对抗鲁棒性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱分类模型易受对抗攻击，现有方法在可扩展性和防御强攻击方面表现不足。

Method: 引入对抗训练，提出AT-RA方法，结合数据增强和空间平滑性保护光谱语义信息。

Result: AT-RA在对抗攻击下鲁棒性提升21.34%（AutoAttack）和18.78%（PGD-50），良性准确率提高2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA有效解决了高光谱数据对抗训练中的独特挑战，显著提升了模型鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Motivation: 人脸图像处理存在隐私和安全风险，现有方法难以平衡安全性、图像质量和可逆性。

Result: 生成的人脸匿名化图像视觉上与原图差异更大，且仅授权方可恢复原图。

Conclusion: 该方法在安全性和图像质量上优于现有工作，适用于隐私保护场景。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

TL;DR: ADD框架通过直接在one-hot空间中保留扩散特性，优于传统的伪离散扩散方法，并在分类和文本生成任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新定义伪离散扩散方法，直接在one-hot空间中保留扩散特性，避免依赖连续潜在空间或掩码策略。

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，连接判别性和生成性学习。

Result: 在分类任务中表现优于基线，同时在图像描述生成任务中展现出优秀的文本生成能力。

Conclusion: ADD框架通过协调机制在one-hot空间中实现扩散特性，显著提升了性能，并通过消融实验验证了各组件的贡献。

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Conclusion: Instant4D在效率和性能上表现优异，适用于野外视频，具有广泛通用性。

Abstract: Dynamic view synthesis has seen significant advances, yet reconstructing
scenes from uncalibrated, casual video remains challenging due to slow
optimization and complex parameter estimation. In this work, we present
Instant4D, a monocular reconstruction system that leverages native 4D
representation to efficiently process casual video sequences within minutes,

recovery through deep visual SLAM, followed by grid pruning to optimize scene
representation. Our design significantly reduces redundancy while maintaining
geometric integrity, cutting model size to under 10% of its original footprint.
To handle temporal dynamics efficiently, we introduce a streamlined 4D Gaussian
representation, achieving a 30x speed-up and reducing training time to within
two minutes, while maintaining competitive performance across several
benchmarks. Our method reconstruct a single video within 10 minutes on the
Dycheck dataset or for a typical 200-frame video. We further apply our model to

TL;DR: Code2Video提出了一种基于代码的框架，通过Python代码生成教育视频，解决了现有生成模型在专业教育视频制作中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型难以满足专业教育视频对学科知识、精确视觉结构和连贯过渡的需求，因此需要一个可控制的渲染环境。

Method: Code2Video包含三个协作代理：Planner（规划内容）、Coder（生成代码）和Critic（优化布局），并通过MMMC基准进行系统评估。

Result: Code2Video在代码效率和视频质量上表现优异，比直接代码生成提升40%，视频质量接近人工制作的教程。

Conclusion: Code2Video是一种可扩展、可解释且可控的方法，适用于教育视频生成。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

Motivation: 受人类在3D环境中进行心理探索和回放的能力启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 利用视频生成器生成未来帧，通过前馈即插即用变换器演化3D重建，并基于几何重投影合成未来场景。

Result: 实验表明，EvoWorld在视觉保真度和空间一致性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EvoWorld代表了长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前开环方法在复杂任务中鲁棒性差和错误累积的问题。

Result: 在任务成功率上优于基线25.9%，并在实际工业机器人中验证了鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RoboPilot在复杂任务中表现出色，适用于动态环境。

Abstract: Despite rapid progress in autonomous robotics, executing complex or
long-horizon tasks remains a fundamental challenge. Most current approaches
follow an open-loop paradigm with limited reasoning and no feedback, resulting
in poor robustness to environmental changes and severe error accumulation. We
present RoboPilot, a dual-thinking closed-loop framework for robotic
manipulation that supports adaptive reasoning for complex tasks in real-world
dynamic environments. RoboPilot leverages primitive actions for structured task
planning and flexible action generation, while introducing feedback to enable
replanning from dynamic changes and execution errors. Chain-of-Thought
reasoning further enhances high-level task planning and guides low-level action
generation. The system dynamically switches between fast and slow thinking to
balance efficiency and accuracy. To systematically evaluate the robustness of
RoboPilot in diverse robot manipulation scenarios, we introduce
RoboPilot-Bench, a benchmark spanning 21 tasks across 10 categories, including
infeasible-task recognition and failure recovery. Experiments show that
RoboPilot outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25.9\% in task success
rate, and the real-world deployment on an industrial robot further demonstrates
its robustness in real-world settings.

Motivation: 研究LLM在机器人任务中的规划能力，探索如何将其语义知识与TAMP的形式推理结合。

Method: 开发了16种算法，使用Gemini 2.5 Flash替代TAMP的关键组件，并在4,950个问题和三个领域中进行零样本实验。

Result: Gemini规划器成功率较低且耗时更长，几何细节会增加任务规划错误，非推理LLM变体表现优于推理变体。

Conclusion: TAMP系统可以指导LLM纠正错误，但当前LLM在机器人任务中的规划能力仍需改进。

Abstract: Using large language models (LLMs) to solve complex robotics problems
requires understanding their planning capabilities. Yet while we know that LLMs
can plan on some problems, the extent to which these planning capabilities
cover the space of robotics tasks is unclear. One promising direction is to
integrate the semantic knowledge of LLMs with the formal reasoning of task and
motion planning (TAMP). However, the myriad of choices for how to integrate
LLMs within TAMP complicates the design of such systems. We develop 16
algorithms that use Gemini 2.5 Flash to substitute key TAMP components. Our
zero-shot experiments across 4,950 problems and three domains reveal that the
Gemini-based planners exhibit lower success rates and higher planning times
than their engineered counterparts. We show that providing geometric details
increases the number of task-planning errors compared to pure PDDL
descriptions, and that (faster) non-reasoning LLM variants outperform (slower)
reasoning variants in most cases, since the TAMP system can direct the LLM to
correct its mistakes.

Motivation: NMPC计算负担重，而NMPC-DNN在意外干扰或训练数据外条件下缺乏鲁棒性，导致跟踪误差大。

Method: 将NMPC-DNN输出与PI控制器结合，应用于外骨骼机器人下蹲运动，并开发了包含三个主动关节的人机动态模型。

Result: 在DNN未见条件下，Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI的跟踪误差显著低于NMPC-DNN，且关节扭矩大幅降低（踝、膝、髋分别减少30.9%、41.8%、29.7%）。

Conclusion: Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI显著提高了鲁棒性和计算效率（计算成本降低99.93%），适用于复杂动态系统。

Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a precise controller, but its
heavy computational load often prevents application in robotic systems. Some
studies have attempted to approximate NMPC using deep neural networks
(NMPC-DNN). However, in the presence of unexpected disturbances or when
operating conditions differ from training data, this approach lacks robustness,
leading to large tracking errors. To address this issue, for the first time,
the NMPC-DNN output is combined with a PI controller (Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI). The
proposed controller is validated by applying it to an exoskeleton robot during
squat movement, which has a complex dynamic model and has received limited
attention regarding robust nonlinear control design. A human-robot dynamic
model with three active joints (ankle, knee, hip) is developed, and more than
5.3 million training samples are used to train the DNN. The results show that,
under unseen conditions for the DNN, the tracking error in Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI
is significantly lower compared to NMPC-DNN. Moreover, human joint torques are
greatly reduced with the use of the exoskeleton, with RMS values for the
studied case reduced by 30.9%, 41.8%, and 29.7% at the ankle, knee, and hip,
respectively. In addition, the computational cost of Hybrid NMPC-DNN-PI is
99.93% lower than that of NMPC.

Motivation: 解决复杂、长时程任务的控制策略学习问题，尤其是STL的非马尔可夫性和稀疏奖励特性带来的挑战。

Result: 在五个环境中测试，TGPO平均任务成功率比最佳基线提高31.6%，尤其在复杂和高维任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: TGPO通过分层设计和时间分配优化，有效解决了复杂STL任务，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Learning control policies for complex, long-horizon tasks is a central
challenge in robotics and autonomous systems. Signal Temporal Logic (STL)
offers a powerful and expressive language for specifying such tasks, but its
non-Markovian nature and inherent sparse reward make it difficult to be solved
via standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms. Prior RL approaches focus
only on limited STL fragments or use STL robustness scores as sparse terminal
rewards. In this paper, we propose TGPO, Temporal Grounded Policy Optimization,
to solve general STL tasks. TGPO decomposes STL into timed subgoals and
invariant constraints and provides a hierarchical framework to tackle the
problem. The high-level component of TGPO proposes concrete time allocations
for these subgoals, and the low-level time-conditioned policy learns to achieve
the sequenced subgoals using a dense, stage-wise reward signal. During
inference, we sample various time allocations and select the most promising
assignment for the policy network to rollout the solution trajectory. To foster
efficient policy learning for complex STL with multiple subgoals, we leverage
the learned critic to guide the high-level temporal search via
Metropolis-Hastings sampling, focusing exploration on temporally feasible
solutions. We conduct experiments on five environments, ranging from
low-dimensional navigation to manipulation, drone, and quadrupedal locomotion.
Under a wide range of STL tasks, TGPO significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines (especially for high-dimensional and long-horizon
cases), with an average of 31.6% improvement in task success rate compared to
the best baseline. The code will be available at

Result: 在四旋翼模拟中，BC-MPPI保持安全裕度并满足违规概率要求。

Conclusion: BC-MPPI易于集成到验证和验证流程中，适用于可认证的自主系统。

Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control has recently emerged as a fast,
gradient-free alternative to model-predictive control in highly non-linear
robotic tasks, yet it offers no hard guarantees on constraint satisfaction. We
introduce Bayesian-Constraints MPPI (BC-MPPI), a lightweight safety layer that
attaches a probabilistic surrogate to every state and input constraint. At each
re-planning step the surrogate returns the probability that a candidate
trajectory is feasible; this joint probability scales the weight given to a
candidate, automatically down-weighting rollouts likely to collide or exceed
limits and pushing the sampling distribution toward the safe subset; no
hand-tuned penalty costs or explicit sample rejection required. We train the
surrogate from 1000 offline simulations and deploy the controller on a
quadrotor in MuJoCo with both static and moving obstacles. Across K in
[100,1500] rollouts BC-MPPI preserves safety margins while satisfying the
prescribed probability of violation. Because the surrogate is a stand-alone,
version-controlled artefact and the runtime safety score is a single scalar,
the approach integrates naturally with verification-and-validation pipelines
for certifiable autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 结论表明MO-IRL能高效揭示人类运动控制的动态成本结构，适用于人形机器人。

Abstract: This paper investigates the application of Minimal Observation Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (MO-IRL) to model and predict human arm-reaching
movements with time-varying cost weights. Using a planar two-link biomechanical
model and high-resolution motion-capture data from subjects performing a
pointing task, we segment each trajectory into multiple phases and learn
phase-specific combinations of seven candidate cost functions. MO-IRL
iteratively refines cost weights by scaling observed and generated trajectories
in the maximum entropy IRL formulation, greatly reducing the number of required
demonstrations and convergence time compared to classical IRL approaches.
Training on ten trials per posture yields average joint-angle Root Mean Squared
Errors (RMSE) of 6.4 deg and 5.6 deg for six- and eight-segment weight
divisions, respectively, versus 10.4 deg using a single static weight.
Cross-validation on remaining trials and, for the first time, inter-subject
validation on an unseen subject's 20 trials, demonstrates comparable predictive
accuracy, around 8 deg RMSE, indicating robust generalization. Learned weights
emphasize joint acceleration minimization during movement onset and
termination, aligning with smoothness principles observed in biological motion.
These results suggest that MO-IRL can efficiently uncover dynamic,
subject-independent cost structures underlying human motor control, with
potential applications for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Soft snake robots offer remarkable flexibility and adaptability in complex
environments, yet their control remains challenging due to highly nonlinear
dynamics. Existing model-based and bio-inspired controllers rely on simplified
assumptions that limit performance. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has
recently emerged as a promising alternative, but online training is often
impractical because of costly and potentially damaging real-world interactions.
Offline RL provides a safer option by leveraging pre-collected datasets, but it
suffers from distribution shift, which degrades generalization to unseen
scenarios. To overcome this challenge, we propose DiSA-IQL
(Distribution-Shift-Aware Implicit Q-Learning), an extension of IQL that
incorporates robustness modulation by penalizing unreliable state-action pairs
to mitigate distribution shift. We evaluate DiSA-IQL on goal-reaching tasks
across two settings: in-distribution and out-of-distribution evaluation.
Simulation results show that DiSA-IQL consistently outperforms baseline models,
including Behavior Cloning (BC), Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), and vanilla
IQL, achieving higher success rates, smoother trajectories, and improved
robustness. The codes are open-sourced to support reproducibility and to
facilitate further research in offline RL for soft robot control.

Motivation: 多机器人系统的长时程运动预测面临非线性交互、预测误差累积和连续时间动态演化的挑战，需要一种结合物理约束和目标条件的高效方法。

Method: 使用神经控制微分方程（CDEs）构建模型PINCoDE，结合物理约束和目标条件，实现连续时间动态建模和多机器人轨迹预测。

Conclusion: PINCoDE通过物理约束和目标条件实现了高效、可扩展的长时程运动预测，为多机器人系统提供了实用的预测工具。

Abstract: Long-horizon motion forecasting for multiple autonomous robots is challenging
due to non-linear agent interactions, compounding prediction errors, and
continuous-time evolution of dynamics. Learned dynamics of such a system can be
useful in various applications such as travel time prediction,
prediction-guided planning and generative simulation. In this work, we aim to
develop an efficient trajectory forecasting model conditioned on multi-agent
goals. Motivated by the recent success of physics-guided deep learning for
partially known dynamical systems, we develop a model based on neural
Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) for long-horizon motion forecasting.
Unlike discrete-time methods such as RNNs and transformers, neural CDEs operate
in continuous time, allowing us to combine physics-informed constraints and
biases to jointly model multi-robot dynamics. Our approach, named PINCoDE
(Physics-Informed Neural Controlled Differential Equations), learns
differential equation parameters that can be used to predict the trajectories
of a multi-agent system starting from an initial condition. PINCoDE is
conditioned on future goals and enforces physics constraints for robot motion
over extended periods of time. We adopt a strategy that scales our model from
10 robots to 100 robots without the need for additional model parameters, while
producing predictions with an average ADE below 0.5 m for a 1-minute horizon.
Furthermore, progressive training with curriculum learning for our PINCoDE
model results in a 2.7X reduction of forecasted pose error over 4 minute
horizons compared to analytical models.

Motivation: 解决VLA模型依赖模仿学习导致的错误累积和分布偏移下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 引入VLA-RFT框架，利用数据驱动世界模型预测未来视觉观察，生成密集轨迹级奖励信号。

Result: 仅需400次微调步骤，VLA-RFT超越监督基线，效率高于基于模拟器的RL，且在扰动条件下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的RFT是一种实用的后训练范式，可显著增强VLA模型的泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models enable embodied decision-making but rely
heavily on imitation learning, leading to compounding errors and poor
robustness under distribution shift. Reinforcement learning (RL) can mitigate
these issues yet typically demands costly real-world interactions or suffers
from sim-to-real gaps. We introduce VLA-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning
framework that leverages a data-driven world model as a controllable simulator.
Trained from real interaction data, the simulator predicts future visual
observations conditioned on actions, allowing policy rollouts with dense,
trajectory-level rewards derived from goal-achieving references. This design
delivers an efficient and action-aligned learning signal, drastically lowering
sample requirements. With fewer than 400 fine-tuning steps, VLA-RFT surpasses
strong supervised baselines and achieves greater efficiency than
simulator-based RL. Moreover, it exhibits strong robustness under perturbed
conditions, sustaining stable task execution. Our results establish
world-model-based RFT as a practical post-training paradigm to enhance the
generalization and robustness of VLA models. For more details, please refer to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉导航在嵌入式AI中是一个基本问题，但实际部署需要长时程规划能力来处理多目标任务。数据稀缺是主要瓶颈，现有神经网络代理在小样本情况下容易过拟合且泛化能力差。

Method: NeuRO使用部分输入凸神经网络（PICNNs）和保形校准，将噪声视觉预测转化为凸不确定性集，并参数化优化约束；同时将部分可观测性下的规划重新表述为鲁棒优化问题。

Result: 在无序和顺序多目标导航任务上的实验表明，NeuRO在泛化到未见环境方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: NeuRO为开发鲁棒、可泛化的自主代理提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Visual navigation is a fundamental problem in embodied AI, yet practical
deployments demand long-horizon planning capabilities to address
multi-objective tasks. A major bottleneck is data scarcity: policies learned
from limited data often overfit and fail to generalize OOD. Existing neural
network-based agents typically increase architectural complexity that
paradoxically become counterproductive in the small-sample regime. This paper
introduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly
couples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.
Specifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it
transforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty
sets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal
calibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)
it reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization
problem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.
Extensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation
tasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in
generalization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant
advancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising framework for
addressing robot social navigation challenges. However, inherent uncertainties
in pedestrian behavior and limited environmental interaction during training
often lead to suboptimal exploration and distributional shifts between offline
training and online deployment. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes a novel offline-to-online fine-tuning RL algorithm for robot social
navigation by integrating Return-to-Go (RTG) prediction into a causal
Transformer architecture. Our algorithm features a spatiotem-poral fusion model
designed to precisely estimate RTG values in real-time by jointly encoding
temporal pedestrian motion patterns and spatial crowd dynamics. This RTG
prediction framework mitigates distribution shift by aligning offline policy
training with online environmental interactions. Furthermore, a hybrid
offline-online experience sampling mechanism is built to stabilize policy
updates during fine-tuning, ensuring balanced integration of pre-trained
knowledge and real-time adaptation. Extensive experiments in simulated social
navigation environments demonstrate that our method achieves a higher success
rate and lower collision rate compared to state-of-the-art baselines. These
results underscore the efficacy of our algorithm in enhancing navigation policy
robustness and adaptability. This work paves the way for more reliable and
adaptive robotic navigation systems in real-world applications.

Conclusion: Traj2Action有效解决了人机技能迁移问题，显著提升了机器人学习效果。

Abstract: Learning diverse manipulation skills for real-world robots is severely
bottlenecked by the reliance on costly and hard-to-scale teleoperated
demonstrations. While human videos offer a scalable alternative, effectively
transferring manipulation knowledge is fundamentally hindered by the
significant morphological gap between human and robotic embodiments. To address
this challenge and facilitate skill transfer from human to robot, we introduce
Traj2Action,a novel framework that bridges this embodiment gap by using the 3D
trajectory of the operational endpoint as a unified intermediate
representation, and then transfers the manipulation knowledge embedded in this
trajectory to the robot's actions. Our policy first learns to generate a coarse
trajectory, which forms an high-level motion plan by leveraging both human and
robot data. This plan then conditions the synthesis of precise, robot-specific
actions (e.g., orientation and gripper state) within a co-denoising framework.
Extensive real-world experiments on a Franka robot demonstrate that Traj2Action
boosts the performance by up to 27% and 22.25% over $\pi_0$ baseline on short-
and long-horizon real-world tasks, and achieves significant gains as human data
scales in robot policy learning. Our project website, featuring code and video
demonstrations, is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂环境中的NLOS传播、多径效应和信号遮挡会导致伪距测量中的大异常值，严重影响GNSS-RTK定位和集成导航系统的性能。

Method: 第一阶段使用多普勒测量检测伪距异常值；第二阶段利用预积分IMU和里程计约束生成预测的双差伪距测量，进一步识别和剔除异常值。

Result: 在深城市峡谷测试中，该方法将融合定位的RMSE从0.52米降低到0.30米，提升了42.3%。

Conclusion: 两阶段检测框架显著减少了伪距异常值的影响，提高了定位精度和一致性。

Abstract: Reliable GNSS positioning in complex environments remains a critical
challenge due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation, multipath effects, and
frequent signal blockages. These effects can easily introduce large outliers
into the raw pseudo-range measurements, which significantly degrade the
performance of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) real-time kinematic
(RTK) positioning and limit the effectiveness of tightly coupled GNSS-based
integrated navigation system. To address this issue, we propose a two-stage
outlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,
inertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor
graph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed
to detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less
sensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a
more stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second
stage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints
are used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,
which enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.
By combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved
robustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite
measuring quality. The experimental results demonstrate that the two-stage
detection framework significantly reduces the impact of pseudo-range outliers,
and leads to improved positioning accuracy and consistency compared with
representative baseline approaches. In the deep urban canyon test, the outlier
mitigation method has limits the RMSE of GNSS-RTK/INS/odometer fusion from 0.52
m to 0.30 m, with 42.3% improvement.

Motivation: 现有机器人学习方法难以处理食物状态的多样性和动态性，导致溢出和可靠性下降。

Method: 利用引导扩散策略和溢出预测器，在模拟数据集上训练，优化动作轨迹以减少溢出。

Result: 在真实平台上测试，GRITS任务成功率为82%，溢出率仅为4%，比无引导基线减少40%。

Abstract: Robotic food scooping is a critical manipulation skill for food preparation
and service robots. However, existing robot learning algorithms, especially
learn-from-demonstration methods, still struggle to handle diverse and dynamic
food states, which often results in spillage and reduced reliability. In this
work, we introduce GRITS: A Spillage-Aware Guided Diffusion Policy for Robot
Food Scooping Tasks. This framework leverages guided diffusion policy to
minimize food spillage during scooping and to ensure reliable transfer of food
items from the initial to the target location. Specifically, we design a
spillage predictor that estimates the probability of spillage given current
observation and action rollout. The predictor is trained on a simulated dataset
with food spillage scenarios, constructed from four primitive shapes (spheres,
cubes, cones, and cylinders) with varied physical properties such as mass,
friction, and particle size. At inference time, the predictor serves as a
differentiable guidance signal, steering the diffusion sampling process toward
safer trajectories while preserving task success. We validate GRITS on a
real-world robotic food scooping platform. GRITS is trained on six food
categories and evaluated on ten unseen categories with different shapes and
quantities. GRITS achieves an 82% task success rate and a 4% spillage rate,
reducing spillage by over 40% compared to baselines without guidance, thereby
demonstrating its effectiveness.

Motivation: 现有方法因生成长链思维而增加推理时间，影响实时性，尤其在机器人任务中。研究目标是探索是否必须生成长链思维才能提升性能。

Method: 提出混合训练框架（HyT），使视觉-语言-动作模型（VLA）能从思维中学习，同时允许推理时跳过CoT生成。

Result: HyT在模拟和真实实验中验证了其灵活性，支持直接预测动作或生成思维。

Conclusion: HyT框架在保持性能的同时，减少了推理时间，提升了实用性。

Abstract: Using Large Language Models to produce intermediate thoughts, a.k.a.
Chain-of-thought (CoT), before providing an answer has been a successful recipe
for solving complex language tasks. In robotics, similar embodied CoT
strategies, generating thoughts before actions, have also been shown to lead to
improved performance when using Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). As these
techniques increase the length of the model's generated outputs to include the
thoughts, the inference time is negatively affected. Delaying an agent's
actions in real-world executions, as in robotic manipulation settings, strongly
affects the usability of a method, as tasks require long sequences of actions.
However, is the generation of long chains-of-thought a strong prerequisite for
achieving performance improvements? In this work, we explore the idea of Hybrid
Training (HyT), a framework that enables VLAs to learn from thoughts and
benefit from the associated performance gains, while enabling the possibility
to leave out CoT generation during inference. Furthermore, by learning to
conditionally predict a diverse set of outputs, HyT supports flexibility at
inference time, enabling the model to either predict actions directly, generate
thoughts or follow instructions. We evaluate the proposed method in a series of
simulated benchmarks and real-world experiments.

Abstract: Automated driving functions increasingly rely on machine learning for tasks
like perception and trajectory planning, requiring large, relevant datasets.
The performance of these algorithms depends on how closely the training data
matches the task. To ensure reliable functioning, it is crucial to know what is
included in the dataset to assess the trained model's operational risk. We aim
to enhance the safe use of machine learning in automated driving by developing
a method to recognize situations that an automated vehicle has not been
sufficiently trained on. This method also improves explainability by describing
the dataset at a human-understandable level. We propose modeling driving data
as knowledge graphs, representing driving scenes with entities and their
relationships. These graphs are queried for specific sub-scene configurations
to check their occurrence in the dataset. We estimate a vehicle's competence in
a driving scene by considering the coverage and complexity of sub-scene
configurations in the training set. Higher complexity scenes require greater
coverage for high competence. We apply this method to the NuPlan dataset,
modeling it with knowledge graphs and analyzing the coverage of specific
driving scenes. This approach helps monitor the competence of machine learning
models trained on the dataset, which is essential for trustworthy AI to be
deployed in automated driving.

Abstract: Efficient observer design and accurate sensor fusion are key in state
estimation. This work proposes an optimization-based methodology, termed
Trajectory Based Optimization Design (TBOD), allowing the user to easily design
observers for general nonlinear systems and multi-sensor setups. Starting from
parametrized observer dynamics, the proposed method considers a finite set of
pre-recorded measurement trajectories from the nominal plant and exploits them
to tune the observer parameters through numerical optimization. This research
hinges on the classic observer's theory and Moving Horizon Estimators
methodology. Optimization is exploited to ease the observer's design, providing
the user with a lightweight, general-purpose sensor fusion methodology. TBOD's
main characteristics are the capability to handle general sensors efficiently
and in a modular way and, most importantly, its straightforward tuning
procedure. The TBOD's performance is tested on a terrestrial rover localization
problem, combining IMU and ranging sensors provided by Ultra Wide Band
antennas, and validated through a motion-capture system. Comparison with an
Extended Kalman Filter is also provided, matching its position estimation
accuracy and significantly improving in the orientation.

Abstract: After years of growth, drone-based delivery is transforming logistics. At its
core, real-time 6-DoF drone pose tracking enables precise flight control and
accurate drone landing. With the widespread availability of urban 3D maps, the
Visual Positioning Service (VPS), a mobile pose estimation system, has been
adapted to enhance drone pose tracking during the landing phase, as
conventional systems like GPS are unreliable in urban environments due to
signal attenuation and multi-path propagation. However, deploying the current
VPS on drones faces limitations in both estimation accuracy and efficiency. In
this work, we redesign drone-oriented VPS with the event camera and introduce
EV-Pose to enable accurate, high-frequency 6-DoF pose tracking for accurate
drone landing. EV-Pose introduces a spatio-temporal feature-instructed pose
estimation module that extracts a temporal distance field to enable 3D point
map matching for pose estimation; and a motion-aware hierarchical fusion and
optimization scheme to enhance the above estimation in accuracy and efficiency,
by utilizing drone motion in the \textit{early stage} of event filtering and
the \textit{later stage} of pose optimization. Evaluation shows that EV-Pose
achieves a rotation accuracy of 1.34$\degree$ and a translation accuracy of
6.9$mm$ with a tracking latency of 10.08$ms$, outperforming baselines by
$>$50\%, \tmcrevise{thus enabling accurate drone landings.} Demo:

Motivation: 现有VLA模型仅依赖当前观察，忽略了历史上下文，而机器人操作任务通常是历史依赖的。

Method: 提出HAMLET框架，使用时间对比学习初始化时刻令牌，并通过轻量级记忆模块整合历史信息。

Result: 在GR00T N1.5上，HAMLET平均成功率达76.4%，比基线提升47.2%；在RoboCasa Kitchen和LIBERO上也有显著提升。

Conclusion: HAMLET成功将VLA转化为历史感知策略，尤其在需要历史上下文的任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Inherently, robotic manipulation tasks are history-dependent: leveraging past
context could be beneficial. However, most existing Vision-Language-Action
models (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they
rely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this
paper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the
historical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment
tokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their
representations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them
to better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight
memory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into
memory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through
empirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a
state-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating
significant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.
In particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of
76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline
performance by 47.2%. Furthermore, HAMLET pushes prior art performance from
64.1% to 66.4% on RoboCasa Kitchen (100-demo setup) and from 95.6% to 97.7% on
LIBERO, highlighting its effectiveness even under generic robot-manipulation
benchmarks.

*Giovanni Minelli,Giulio Turrisi,Victor Barasuol,Claudio Semini*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的状态转移注意力机制（STA），通过建模状态演化模式来增强机器人操作策略的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理执行变化时缺乏对演示中时间结构（如失败和恢复模式）的显式建模。

Method: 提出Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer，结合STA机制和训练时的时序掩码，以增强历史上下文的时间推理能力。

Result: 在仿真实验中，STA显著优于标准交叉注意力和时序建模方法（如TCN和LSTM），在关键任务上性能提升超过2倍。

Conclusion: STA机制通过显式建模状态演化模式，有效提升了策略对执行变化的适应能力。

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies through supervised learning from
demonstrations remains challenging when policies encounter execution variations
not explicitly covered during training. While incorporating historical context
through attention mechanisms can improve robustness, standard approaches
process all past states in a sequence without explicitly modeling the temporal
structure that demonstrations may include, such as failure and recovery
patterns. We propose a Cross-State Transition Attention Transformer that
employs a novel State Transition Attention (STA) mechanism to modulate standard
attention weights based on learned state evolution patterns, enabling policies
to better adapt their behavior based on execution history. Our approach
combines this structured attention with temporal masking during training, where
visual information is randomly removed from recent timesteps to encourage
temporal reasoning from historical context. Evaluation in simulation shows that
STA consistently outperforms standard cross-attention and temporal modeling
approaches like TCN and LSTM networks across all tasks, achieving more than 2x
improvement over cross-attention on precision-critical tasks.

Abstract: Semantic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a critical area of
research within robotics and computer vision, focusing on the simultaneous
localization of robotic systems and associating semantic information to
construct the most accurate and complete comprehensive model of the surrounding

proposed, which divides the problem into discrete stages, including visual
localization, semantic feature extraction, mapping, data association, and loop
closure optimization. Moreover, this study investigates alternative
methodologies such as deep learning and the utilization of large language
models, alongside a review of relevant research about contemporary SLAM
datasets. Concluding with a discussion on potential future research directions,

TL;DR: 提出了一种随机到目标布料展平（RTFF）策略，通过混合模仿学习-视觉伺服（IL-VS）框架，实现布料的高精度对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 布料在服装生产中的变形性、自由度多和遮挡问题导致展平和对齐困难。

Method: 采用IL-VS框架，结合模板网格和Transformer策略（MACT），实现粗对齐和精细对齐。

Result: 在真实双臂遥操作系统中验证了策略的零样本对齐能力、高精度和强泛化性。

Conclusion: RTFF策略有效解决了布料展平和对齐的挑战，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Robotic fabric manipulation in garment production for sewing, cutting, and
ironing requires reliable flattening and alignment, yet remains challenging due
to fabric deformability, effectively infinite degrees of freedom, and frequent
occlusions from wrinkles, folds, and the manipulator's End-Effector (EE) and
arm. To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target
Fabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to
an arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid
Imitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with
explicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a
wrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the
target. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise
target state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent
vertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust
manipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a
novel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then
proposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.
The RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing
zero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong
generalization across fabrics and scales. Project website:

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于PPR建模范式的PoPAN模型，旨在将产品生命周期末端阶段的影响纳入工程阶段，支持产品全生命周期的数字化管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业标准通常仅关注生产阶段，而忽略了产品全生命周期，尤其是末端阶段（如维修、再制造或升级）的影响。

Method: 结合PPR建模范式，提出PoPAN模型，以产品结构为基础，并支持维修、再制造或升级。模型通过AutomationML数据格式序列化，并在电动汽车电池拆卸案例中验证。

Result: PoPAN模型成功应用于电动汽车电池拆卸案例，支持其再制造为固定电池应用。

Conclusion: PoPAN模型为产品全生命周期管理提供了数字化支持，尤其适用于复杂机电系统的末端阶段处理。

Abstract: Current products, especially in the automotive sector, pose complex technical
systems having a multi-disciplinary mechatronic nature. Industrial standards
supporting system engineering and production typically (i) address the
production phase only, but do not cover the complete product life cycle, and
(ii) focus on production processes and resources rather than the products
themselves. The presented approach is motivated by incorporating impacts of
end-of-life phase of the product life cycle into the engineering phase. This
paper proposes a modelling approach coming up from the Product-Process-Resource
(PPR) modeling paradigm. It combines requirements on (i) respecting the product
structure as a basis for the model, and (ii) it incorporates repairing,
remanufacturing, or upcycling within cyber-physical production systems. The
proposed model called PoPAN should accompany the product during the entire life
cycle as a digital shadow encapsulated within the Asset Administration Shell of
a product. To facilitate the adoption of the proposed paradigm, the paper also
proposes serialization of the model in the AutomationML data format. The model
is demonstrated on a use-case for disassembling electric vehicle batteries to
support their remanufacturing for stationary battery applications.

Conclusion: 框架在理论和实践中均表现出色，为实时VIN提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a task-oriented computational framework to enhance
Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) in robots, addressing challenges such as
limited time and energy resources. The framework strategically selects visual
features using a Mean Squared Error (MSE)-based, non-submodular objective
function and a simplified dynamic anticipation model. To address the
NP-hardness of this problem, we introduce four polynomial-time approximation
algorithms: a classic greedy method with constant-factor guarantees; a low-rank
greedy variant that significantly reduces computational complexity; a
randomized greedy sampler that balances efficiency and solution quality; and a
linearization-based selector based on a first-order Taylor expansion for
near-constant-time execution. We establish rigorous performance bounds by
leveraging submodularity ratios, curvature, and element-wise curvature
analyses. Extensive experiments on both standardized benchmarks and a custom
control-aware platform validate our theoretical results, demonstrating that
these methods achieve strong approximation guarantees while enabling real-time
deployment.

Conclusion: GPC是一种简单有效的策略组合方法，能利用现有策略提升控制性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based models for robotic control, including vision-language-action
(VLA) and vision-action (VA) policies, have demonstrated significant
capabilities. Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of
acquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative
paradigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.
Perhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the
performance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we
establish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of
distributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior
one-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A
Gr\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement
propagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic
performance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General
Policy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by
combining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a
convex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the
plug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA
models, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of
their input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical
validation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside
real-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves
performance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of
alternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into
the mechanisms underlying the success of GPC. These results establish GPC as a
simple yet effective method for improving control performance by leveraging
existing policies.

Result: 系统能在起飞到着陆过程中完成复杂轨迹控制，并保持着陆时的严格姿态控制。

Conclusion: 该方法计算高效，适用于不同尺寸的跳跃机器人和四旋翼飞行器。

Abstract: The advent of rotor-based hopping robots has created very capable hopping
platforms with high agility and efficiency, and similar controllability, as
compared to their purely flying quadrotor counterparts. Advances in robot
performance have increased the hopping height to greater than 4 meters and
opened up the possibility for more complex aerial trajectories (i.e.,
behaviors). However, currently hopping robots do not directly control their
aerial trajectory or transition to flight, eliminating the efficiency benefits
of a hopping system. Here we show a real-time, computationally efficiency,
non-linear drag compensated, trajectory generation methodology and accompanying
Lyapunov-based controller. The combined system can create and follow complex
aerial trajectories from liftoff to touchdown on horizontal and vertical
surfaces, while maintaining strick control over the orientation at touchdown.
The computational efficiency provides broad applicability across all size
scales of hopping robots while maintaining applicability to quadrotors in
general.

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效量化测试覆盖，识别不足内容区域，并推荐高价值新问题。

Conclusion: 为开发者提供了构建更健壮测试套件的工具，提升系统可靠性。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLIP模型通过等变神经网络架构强制对称性，可能导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 提出TransIP，通过优化非等变Transformer模型的嵌入空间表示来学习SO(3)等变性。

Result: 在OMol25数据集上，TransIP性能与现有方法相当，且比数据增强基线提升40%-60%。

Conclusion: 学习等变性可以成为等变或基于增强的MLIP模型的高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的长上下文支持对长距离依赖任务至关重要，但RoPE插值与量化结合会导致精度下降。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法，分组RoPE维度并轻量搜索优化，无需微调或架构改动。

Result: Q-ROAR降低长上下文任务的困惑度14%以上，保持短上下文性能和推理效率。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR是高效且兼容现有系统的解决方案。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

Method: 提出p-adic度量空间的理论框架，证明其最小化距离的平面必须通过至少n+1个数据点，与欧几里得回归形成对比。

Result: p-adic度量能更好地处理层次化数据，多项式拟合和近似结果也验证了其优越性。

Conclusion: p-adic度量是处理层次化数据的根本方法，实际应用证明了其重要性。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，解决联邦学习中表格数据异构性问题，提升性能并降低通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域有广泛应用，但表格数据的异构性（如模式差异和特征空间不兼容）阻碍了直接聚合。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，利用LLM（如DistilBERT、ALBERT等）生成语义对齐的嵌入表示，支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠心病预测任务中，FedLLM-Align在所有客户端设置和LLM骨干上均优于基线方法，F1分数提升0.25，通信成本降低65%。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align是一种鲁棒、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案，适用于异构环境中的联邦学习。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Result: 实验验证了该模型在序数数据统计建模和序数回归任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够有效缓解传统模型的偏差问题，适用于更广泛的序数数据场景。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

Motivation: 现有Transformer模型在计算上存在时间和空间复杂度的二次方问题，且脉冲神经网络（SNN）的训练方法效率低下。

Method: 1. 用脉冲自注意力（SSA）替代自注意力机制；2. 将前馈块转换为SNN；3. 使用SNN代理学习算法微调SSA块。

Result: 在GPT-2小模型上，余弦相似度损失5-12%，困惑度降低9.7%，自注意力机制能效提升64.71%-85.28%。

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法在保持模型性能的同时显著提升了能效，适用于大规模SNN模型的推理任务。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

Motivation: 人类通过比较多样观察学习概念，但机器学习领域缺乏相关理论支持。作者认为比较机制对机器恢复数据背后的真实概念至关重要。

Method: 开发了一个多类观察下概念可识别性的理论框架，利用类间多样性识别隐藏概念，无需特定假设。

Result: 证明在足够多样性条件下，隐藏概念可被识别，且即使条件不全局满足，也能通过局部比较提供部分保证。

Conclusion: 理论框架扩展了概念学习的适用范围，并在合成和真实数据中验证了结果。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

Motivation: 由于计算或财务限制，获取大量奖励标签在实际问题中不可行，尤其是在依赖人类反馈时。因此，研究如何在有限反馈下选择最有价值的奖励标签至关重要。

Method: 论文提出了RLLF问题，并研究了两种奖励选择策略：(i) 基于无奖励信息的启发式方法，(ii) 利用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 研究发现，关键奖励子集能引导智能体沿最优轨迹行动，并在偏离后支持恢复。有效选择方法能以显著更少的奖励标签实现接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是扩展反馈受限场景下强化学习的有力范式，显著减少所需标签数量，同时保持性能。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Conclusion: 该方法为评估不可识别的反事实公平性提供了有效工具，揭示了算法决策中的潜在偏见。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Conclusion: 通过逆向工程揭示了Transformer学习长程依赖的陷阱，并展示了正确归纳偏置如何解决这一问题。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过动态剪枝和灵活秩分配提升了低秩适配器的表达能力，为参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了LLMs的推理能力，尤其在复杂任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过优化内存访问和任务调度，显著提升了LoRA微调的效率，可作为现有系统的即插即用替代方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to

*Yang Zhang,Huiwen Yan,Mushuang Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Directed-MAML是一种改进的元强化学习算法，通过任务导向的一阶近似加速收敛并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAML在元强化学习中面临计算和收敛挑战，需要更高效的替代方案。

Method: 在二阶梯度步骤前应用任务导向的一阶近似，优化计算和收敛速度。

Result: 在多个场景中超越MAML基线，计算效率和收敛速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可推广至其他元学习算法，提升整体性能。

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

TL;DR: Thoughtbubbles是一种改进的Transformer变体，通过在潜在空间中并行自适应计算，显著提升了推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时计算扩展上存在局限，无法在预训练阶段应用且仅支持串行生成的自然语言表达。

Method: 提出Thoughtbubbles，通过学习复制或删除残差流，在潜在空间中实现并行自适应计算。

Result: 在OpenWebText和peS2o等数据集上优于标准解码器LM和非自适应并行计算方法，并在零样本评估中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在预训练阶段即可学习自适应计算，为推理模型的训练与测试行为统一提供了新途径。

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

TL;DR: KV缓存压缩虽能提升吞吐量和效率，但在多指令提示等实际场景中可能导致某些指令被忽略，需注意压缩方法和KV淘汰策略的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际场景（如多指令提示）中的潜在问题，尤其是某些指令因压缩而被忽略的现象。

Method: 分析压缩对指令跟随的影响，识别导致系统提示泄漏的因素（压缩方法、指令顺序、KV淘汰偏差），并提出改进的KV淘汰策略。

Result: 发现某些指令在压缩下性能急剧下降，系统提示泄漏现象明显，改进的淘汰策略可提升多指令任务性能。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩需谨慎部署，改进淘汰策略可缓解压缩带来的负面影响。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学机器学习在高维时空流数据中提取物理洞察时，潜在空间的可解释性仍是一个挑战。

Method: DIANO通过编码和解码神经算子实现高维输入函数的压缩和重建，并在潜在空间中集成可微分的PDE求解器。

Result: DIANO在维度缩减和几何缩减方面表现优异，同时支持潜在空间的可解释性。

Conclusion: DIANO能够解决PDE问题，并在潜在空间中实现维度和几何缩减，同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习训练算法仅利用梯度平均值，忽略了其他梯度统计信息。本文旨在证明高效计算这些统计信息的可行性，并探索其在算法设计中的潜力。

Method: 通过自动微分图的手术实现梯度统计计算，利用JAX的向量化变换进行原型设计。研究了signSGD和Adam预处理器在梯度统计视角下的表现。

Result: 发现signSGD中符号操作的位置对性能至关重要，且Adam预处理器中均值比方差对优化更有利。

Conclusion: 梯度统计信息为算法设计提供了新的分析和可能性，挑战了传统优化方法的观点。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新评估SFT的泛化能力，反驳其仅能记忆训练数据而无法泛化的普遍观点。

Method: 在Sokoban和General Points基准上，引入提示多样性和思维链监督，改进SFT的泛化能力。

Result: 改进后的SFT在指令变体和难度变体任务中表现优异，匹配或超越RL基线。

Conclusion: 适当的数据增强和算法支持可以使SFT达到与RL相当的泛化能力，挑战了SFT固有劣势的叙事。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing
the results in the paper can be found at:

Motivation: 显微镜技术生成大量复杂图像数据，需要更简单、可解释的低维表示来揭示物理结构。VAE性能依赖设计选择，需自动化优化方法。

Method: 研究基于奖励的策略，评估潜在空间表示，使用压电力显微镜数据，分析高斯混合模型（GMM）和贝叶斯高斯混合模型（BGMM）作为奖励函数基础。

Result: GMM和BGMM能有效估计模型效率，指导寻找最优简洁表示。

Conclusion: 奖励策略和GMM/BGMM为VAE工作流程的自动化优化提供了可行方法。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

Motivation: 通过借鉴编码计算的思想，设计一种高效的正则化机制，以平滑表示并提升模型的泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 将编码计算原理应用于机器学习，设计coded-smoothing模块，通过处理数据的线性组合而非原始输入，实现正则化。

Result: 在监督和无监督任务中，coded-smoothing显著提升了泛化能力，并在对抗梯度攻击时表现出最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: coded-smoothing是一种高效且通用的方法，能够同时提升模型的泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Result: 混合模型在训练序列三倍长度的测试序列上达到>90%的准确率。

Conclusion: 延迟训练注意力层的策略有效解决了捷径依赖问题，显著提升了长度泛化能力。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

Motivation: VAE生成的样本模糊且不一致，原因是“先验空洞”问题，即先验和后验概率不匹配。需要一种灵活的先验模型来改善这一问题。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型（EBM），并通过变分方法绕过MCMC的昂贵计算，使用采样网络近似变分形式。

Result: EVaLP方法在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面优于现有基线。

Conclusion: EVaLP通过变分方法有效解决了EBM的归一化问题，提升了生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

Motivation: 现有方法将逻辑规则视为通用的，忽略了查询特定上下文的影响。

Method: 提出SLogic框架，利用查询头实体的子图动态评分逻辑规则。

Result: 在基准数据集上，SLogic优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过结合局部子图上下文，显著提升了知识图谱补全的效果。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

TL;DR: Freedave算法为DLLMs提供无损并行解码，提升推理效率。

Motivation: DLLMs的双向注意力机制虽增强上下文连接能力，但与KV Cache不兼容，导致推理效率低。

Method: 提出并行解码候选生成与验证的管道，确保与静态采样相同的序列生成。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，DLLMs的吞吐量提升至2.8倍且无性能损失。

Conclusion: Freedave有效解决了DLLMs推理效率问题，实现了无损加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

TL;DR: DiSC-AMC通过离散化统计和优化上下文提示，显著减少LLM的输入/输出令牌和参数规模，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长提示上下文和大模型规模对实际部署的瓶颈问题。

Method: 离散化高阶统计量、轻量级预过滤和校准提示模板。

Result: 在噪声环境下，DiSC-AMC的准确率从5.2%提升至45.5%，推理成本降低2倍以上。

Conclusion: 离散化和上下文优化能显著降低成本，同时保留基于提示的AMC优势。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

TL;DR: DecepChain是一种新型后门攻击方法，通过诱导LLMs生成看似合理但错误的推理链，攻击隐蔽且难以察觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs推理链的脆弱性，揭示攻击者可能利用其生成错误但看似合理的推理，破坏人类对LLM的信任。

Method: 利用LLMs的幻觉特性，通过微调自然错误样本和GRPO强化攻击，同时保持推理的流畅性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DecepChain攻击成功率高且对正常场景性能影响小，人类评估者难以区分攻击与正常推理。

Conclusion: DecepChain揭示了LLMs推理链的隐蔽风险，需未来研究应对此类威胁。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a
framework for optimal ML algorithm selection. In healthcare, the framework
addresses critical challenges such as cardiovascular disease prediction
accounting for 28.1% of global deaths and fetal health classification into
healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance
efficiency and accuracy in diverse real-world applications. This approach
bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for
interdisciplinary ML deployment.

Motivation: 探索Transformer是否可以在不依赖跳跃连接的情况下高效训练，以保留更好的层次化表示结构。

Method: 分析了无跳跃连接Transformer块的Jacobian矩阵，提出了一种初始化策略来恢复跳跃连接的优化稳定性。

Result: 在视觉Transformer中，该方法克服了优化障碍，学习到更丰富的层次化表示，并在密集预测任务中超越了带跳跃连接的基线模型。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接并非训练视觉Transformer的必要条件，为视觉模型的层次化表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Motivation: 现有决策预训练模型（DPTs）在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要改进。

Method: 提出PPT框架，结合辅助奖励预测器，利用预测误差作为好奇心信号，鼓励训练时更广泛的探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机实验中，PPT表现出更强的鲁棒性，尤其在预训练数据多样性不足时。

Conclusion: 好奇心驱动的预训练为提升上下文强化学习代理的分布外泛化能力提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CMDP缺乏对所有初始分布通用的最优策略，每次初始分布变化时都需要重新求解，因此研究最优值随初始分布的变化具有重要意义。

Method: 通过对CMDP的对偶分析和线性规划中的扰动分析，推导了最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Result: 得出了最优值随初始分布变化的界限，并展示了如何利用这些界限分析策略因初始分布未知变化而产生的遗憾。

Conclusion: 研究为CMDP在初始分布变化时的最优值变化提供了理论界限，并展示了其在策略分析中的应用。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质结构标记方法复杂且难以优化和扩展，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: Kanzi采用扩散自编码器和流匹配损失，简化了表示和训练过程。

Result: Kanzi在重建指标上优于现有标记器，且模型更小、训练成本更低。

Conclusion: Kanzi为蛋白质结构标记提供了更高效的方法，但生成性能仍需改进。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

Result: 在肽和SMILES序列设计中，AReUReDi同时优化五个治疗属性，优于进化和扩散基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi是一种强大的序列生成框架，适用于多属性生物分子设计。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习中数据分布变化复杂，传统注意力机制可能不必要地复杂。

Method: 使用仅查询的注意力机制，丢弃键和值，保留Transformer的核心归纳偏置。

Result: 在持续学习场景中，该方法优于选择性重新初始化等基线方法，且通过Hessian谱分析发现高曲率秩模型更易保持塑性。

Conclusion: 仅查询的注意力机制足以在持续学习中实现元学习的效果，无需完整注意力机制。

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: GDLNN是一种高效且可解释的图分类解决方案。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

Conclusion: 新方法在效率和揭示交互作用方面优于传统方法，适用于多维认知实验。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Result: 新架构在350M-3B参数规模下验证损失更低，下游任务准确率提升1.1-8.3%，训练和推理效率更高。

Conclusion: Composer框架能高效发现高性能混合模型架构，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP方法能够有效学习物理一致的动力学和哈密顿量，同时确保能量平衡和被动性，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

Result: 在指令微调和命名实体识别任务中，新方法在多数情况下实现了更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 新方法简化了数据选择过程，提高了效率，并在理论和实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Graph2Region (G2R) 是一种基于几何的图嵌入方法，通过将节点表示为封闭区域并利用节点特征和邻接模式，近似计算最大公共子图（MCS）和图编辑距离（GED），显著提升了计算效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经网络方法在计算图相似性时的高计算成本和结构信息利用不足的问题。

Method: 将节点表示为封闭区域，通过区域重叠近似MCS，利用不相交部分代理GED，结合局部和全局结构信息。

Result: G2R在MCS相似性学习中相对准确率提升60%，同时高效预测MCS和GED。

Conclusion: G2R提供了一种高效且全面的图相似性计算方法，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态及其在未见过的二元分类任务上的ICL泛化能力进行了理论分析，揭示了其通过线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Mamba模型在语言任务中表现出色，但其理论理解仍有限，主要由于门控机制引入的非线性。本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 分析了一个由线性注意力组件和非线性门控层组成的单层Mamba模型，并与线性Transformer在相同设置下进行比较。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息性上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响，即使在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: Mamba在训练动态和ICL泛化能力上表现出色，尤其在处理异常值方面优于线性Transformer，理论分析得到了实验支持。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

<details>

Motivation: 现有GNN方法在子图匹配中因忽略特征相对位置和缺乏区分性度量，导致约束破坏和错误预测。

Method: NC-Iso通过构建节点根子树中相邻层级的层次依赖关系保留特征位置，并引入相似性优势比增强度量提升排序能力。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实验验证了NC-Iso的有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和时间效率。

Conclusion: NC-Iso为子图检索提供了更具区分性的神经子图匹配解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个从字典学习公式推导稀疏自编码器（SAE）的框架，揭示了现有SAE的局限性，并提出了一种新方法AbsTopK SAE，通过保留正负激活来提升表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器（SAE）缺乏统一的推导框架，且其正则化方法限制了双向概念的表示能力。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法，提出AbsTopK SAE，利用ℓ0稀疏约束保留最大幅度激活的正负值。

Result: AbsTopK在多个任务中提升了重建保真度和可解释性，甚至优于需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留双向激活，显著提升了语义特征的表示能力，为LLM的可解释性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务中优于基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了高效LLM微调的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

Motivation: 解决RL微调扩散模型时的泛化性、组合性和对抗奖励攻击的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）结合RL，逐步更新提示，利用扩散模型的中间潜在状态。

Result: 在多种奖励函数和扩散模型上表现优异，实现了奖励优化、泛化、组合性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: PromptLoop提供了一种灵活且通用的提示优化方法，有效解决了现有RL微调扩散模型的局限性。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据增强方法多为固定或随机变换，忽略了样本难度随模型泛化能力变化的动态性，导致增强数据与模型需求不匹配。

Method: 通过计算样本梯度在模型更新方向上的投影及其时间方差，动态调整增强强度：稳定样本增强更强以增加多样性，不稳定样本增强较弱以保持语义保真。

Result: 在多个基准数据集和模型架构上，SADA表现优异，细粒度任务提升7.3%，长尾数据集提升4.3%。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的动态数据增强方法，能有效提升模型训练效果。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous

vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Motivation: 时间序列的非平稳性（分布随时间变化）给可靠预测带来挑战，现有方法常混淆时间不变和时间变化成分，导致性能不佳。

Result: 实验表明，TimeEmb在真实数据集上优于现有方法，且计算资源需求更低。

Conclusion: TimeEmb通过静态-动态分解有效提升了时间序列预测性能，并可轻松集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at

Conclusion: F2OCL方法在无需存储样本和任务边界的情况下，成功解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: eNTK分析为特征发现和小模型中的相变检测提供了实用工具。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)来诊断持续学习中捷径特征的负面影响，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络常利用无因果意义的捷径特征，这削弱了鲁棒性。在持续学习中，这种影响会加剧，阻碍新技能的学习。

Method: 提出ERI指标，包含三个可解释的维度（AD、PD、SFR_rel），并在CIFAR-100基准上测试多种持续学习方法。

Result: 实验显示持续学习方法在捷径特征存在时表现受限，移除捷径后性能提升。

Conclusion: 捷径特征在持续学习中会分散模型注意力，ERI能有效诊断此类问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

TL;DR: DVD是一种基于潜在扩散模型（LDM）的新框架，用于源自由域适应（SFDA），通过生成源特征标签一致的表示来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索潜在扩散模型在判别性任务中的潜力，解决源自由域适应中无法访问源数据的核心挑战。

Method: 利用高斯先验拟合k近邻，训练扩散网络生成标签一致的表示，并通过InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: DVD在标准SFDA基准测试中优于现有方法，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD重新诠释了LDM作为隐私保护的显式知识转移桥梁，解决了源自由域适应的核心问题。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CPFM的方法，用于解决黑盒时间序列域适应问题，通过双分支网络结构和提示学习提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有黑盒域适应方法在时间序列数据上的局限性，并探索基础模型的潜力。

Method: 采用双分支网络结构，每个分支配备独特提示，结合重建学习和时间序列基础模型。

Result: 在三个时间序列数据集上显著优于竞争对手。

Conclusion: CPFM在黑盒时间序列域适应中表现出色，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了LLM推理是否应独立模块化或集成在单一模型中，发现联合微调（H2）效果最佳，但单一模型基线表现接近，表明当前双模型设计主要增加计算而非显著提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索双架构潜在推理的效能，验证两种假设（H1增加通道容量，H2联合微调）是否能改进潜在通信。

Method: 在GPT-2和Qwen-3上测试双架构潜在推理，比较H1和H2的效果，并与单一模型基线对比。

Result: H2表现最强，H1增益有限；单一模型基线接近H2且优于H1，表明双模型设计未显著提升推理能力。扩展潜在令牌预算未能增强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在理论上仍有潜力，但需设计明确塑造潜在空间的通信机制和目标以支持算法规划。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

TL;DR: DAV框架通过变分期望最大化方法优化扩散模型，避免奖励过优化和模式崩溃，在文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如强化学习或直接反向传播）在最大化奖励时容易导致奖励过优化和模式崩溃，需要一种更稳健的优化框架。

Method: DAV采用E步（测试时搜索生成多样化样本）和M步（用E步样本优化模型）的迭代过程。

Result: DAV在连续和离散任务（如文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中均能优化奖励并保持多样性。

Conclusion: DAV是一种有效的扩散对齐框架，兼顾奖励优化和样本多样性。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

TL;DR: 差分注意力（DA）通过减法结构减少冗余或噪声上下文，但增加了对抗性扰动的脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究差分注意力在提高任务相关性的同时，对抗性扰动下的脆弱性。

Method: 理论分析负梯度对齐，并通过ViT/DiffViT和CLIP/DiffCLIP的实验验证。

Result: DA在干净输入上表现更好，但对抗性攻击成功率更高，梯度范数增加。

Conclusion: DA在选择性增强的同时牺牲了鲁棒性，未来需平衡两者。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型（LLM）中前馈网络（FFN）的宽度选择问题，提出了一种基于频谱利用率的量化方法，揭示了不对称的频谱缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究关注模型规模与损失的关系，但忽略了组件如何利用潜在空间。本文旨在量化FFN的频谱利用率，为高效推理的LLM设计提供指导。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件（Hard Rank、Soft Rank、Spectral Concentration和Spectral Utilization Index）分析LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT家族的FFN。

Result: 发现软秩随FFN宽度呈幂律增长，而硬秩增长缓慢且方差大，表明FFN的潜在空间利用率存在不对称性。

Conclusion: FFN宽度选择是尾部容量与主导模式容量之间的权衡，为高效LLM设计提供了理论依据。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

Conclusion: 集成方法结合透明度可有效解决公共卫生问题。未来研究应探索更先进的算法和数据更新以提高预测准确性。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

Conclusion: 研究为LLM的RL训练提供了高效、可解释的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Result: 实验证明初始参数的重要性，固定循环权重可提高性能并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础和优化策略。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

Result: 在多种数据集上实现2-30倍端到端加速，且不损失召回率。

Conclusion: PANORAMA为ANNS提供了一种高效且通用的优化方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Conclusion: 证明了有限Littlestone维度的概念类在私有在线学习中的广泛适用性。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

Motivation: 现有RAG系统的数据投毒攻击成本高且难以扩展，需要针对每个目标短语优化投毒文档。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，通过优化吸引器引导注意力到焦点区域，插入语义诱饵或恶意指令。

Result: 在18种RAG设置中，攻击成功率从21.9提升至57.8（+35.9点），且单个优化吸引器可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统构成实际威胁，同时揭示了注意力集中与模型输出的强关联。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Conclusion: ETCE和后处理技术能有效改进降水预报的校准问题。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

Conclusion: 结合结构方程的方法显著提升了模糊集的准确性，且在实际应用中具有高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体在推荐系统等应用中需平衡探索与利用，同时满足阶段安全约束的问题。

Method: 提出MA-SCLUCB算法，结合动作选择和共识构建阶段，支持局部通信与全局优化。

Result: 算法实现$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 分布式学习在合理连接网络中可实现接近最优性能，且安全约束仅增加低阶遗憾。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统统计模型依赖预选基展开或核，限制了数据驱动的灵活性；深度学习常将函数视为固定网格向量，忽略了连续性。

Method: FAME结合双向神经控制微分方程和MoE驱动的向量场，捕捉函数内连续性，并通过多头交叉注意力融合函数间依赖关系。

Result: 在合成和真实世界基准测试中，FAME实现了最先进的准确性和对任意离散观测的强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FAME为函数回归提供了一种灵活且强大的数据驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

Motivation: 现有分布式框架缺乏对非欧几里得LMO优化器的支持，且通信瓶颈未解决，EF21-Muon填补了这一空白。

Method: EF21-Muon结合了误差反馈、双向压缩和非欧几里得LMO，支持随机梯度和动量，理论覆盖非欧几里得平滑和广义平滑设置。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的分布式非欧几里得LMO优化器，为大规模深度学习提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

Motivation: 传统方法在分析土-桩相互作用时存在计算复杂或数据依赖性强的问题，需要一种结合物理规律和数据驱动的高效方法。

Method: 将桩建模为欧拉-伯努利梁，周围土体建模为Pasternak地基，通过四阶常微分方程描述土-桩相互作用，并利用极端学习机（ELM）结合物理和数据训练模型。

Conclusion: PIELM框架为土-桩相互作用分析提供了高效解决方案，适用于实时监测和智能预警系统。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

Result: 研究发现数据量并非唯一影响性能的因素，类内相似性和类间差异性同样关键。

Conclusion: 通过One vs Rest方法构建的组合模型能优化分类性能，为数字干预领域的文档分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Motivation: 传统生存分析方法如Cox回归假设比例风险，无法捕捉时变风险。DeepFHT旨在通过随机过程理论提供更灵活的建模方式。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DeepFHT预测准确性与最先进方法相当，同时保持参数可解释性。

Conclusion: DeepFHT为复杂系统中的生存现象建模提供了基于随机过程理论和深度学习的理论框架。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过潜在预测和TD学习，实现了高效的多策略表示学习和零样本优化。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受限于预训练领域，微调后性能提升有限，且不如专用小模型高效。

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的多样性限制了基础模型的有效性，专用小模型在特定任务上更具优势。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Result: 在多个真实数据集和合成任务上的实验表明，LEAP能够有效提取拓扑特征，提升图表示学习性能。

Conclusion: LEAP作为一种新型局部结构PE，具有在图表示学习流程中作为强大组件的潜力。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Conclusion: 优化器的选择是提升LLM遗忘鲁棒性的关键，混合优化器方法在保持遗忘效果的同时增强了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖新消息，LLM难以可靠整合，导致改进不一致。

Method: 引入in-place feedback，用户直接编辑LLM的响应，模型基于修改后的响应生成修订。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型任务中，in-place feedback性能优于传统方法，且节省79.1%的token。

Conclusion: in-place feedback为推理密集型任务提供了更自然有效的指导机制。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

Result: 方法能够在用户感兴趣区域内最大化模式多样性，同时保持全局多样性。

Conclusion: 提出的设计选择和实现有效解决了复杂系统探索中的挑战，支持用户期望的模式发现。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to

Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic
molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing
optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently

Conclusion: 算法有效减少极化和分歧，适用于社交媒体的周期性干预场景。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了GFlowNets在高奖励样本生成中的性能，且不牺牲多样性。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

TL;DR: TSFMs在零样本泛化中表现良好，但在持续适应中存在灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TSFMs在连续微调时的灾难性遗忘现象及其稳定性与可塑性之间的权衡。

Method: 使用具有不同周期结构的合成数据集，测量新数据适应与旧知识保留的权衡。

Result: 微调虽提升新任务性能，但会导致旧任务性能显著下降。

Conclusion: TSFMs面临稳定性与可塑性的根本性困境。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态学习引导权重的方法，以改进条件扩散模型的样本质量，同时保持分布对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态引导权重在提高视觉质量时可能导致分布对齐不佳，因此需要动态调整权重以更好地近似目标条件分布。

Method: 通过学习依赖于条件、去噪时间和目标时间的连续函数作为引导权重，并通过最小化分布不匹配来优化。

Result: 在低维和高维图像生成中，FID指标得到改善；在文本到图像任务中，CLIP分数引导的权重提高了图像与提示的对齐。

Conclusion: 动态学习引导权重的方法在保持视觉质量的同时，显著改善了分布对齐和任务特定性能。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于二阶几何的曲率感知策略优化方法（CAPO），用于稳定强化学习中的策略梯度优化，提高样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在大型语言模型中的优化稳定性不足，导致需要保守的超参数选择，增加了计算成本。

Method: 通过形式化策略梯度的随机优化问题，引入二阶几何信息，设计了一种曲率感知的优化框架，并通过数据选择干预优化过程。

Result: CAPO在激进学习条件下保持稳定，样本效率比标准GRPO提高了30倍。

Conclusion: CAPO通过曲率感知优化，显著提升了策略梯度的稳定性和样本效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 解决在LLM路由中选择最佳模型的问题，同时平衡用户满意度、模型专业性和推理成本。

Method: 将路由问题建模为上下文决斗老虎机，引入类别校准微调（CCFT）和Feel-Good Thompson Sampling算法（FGTS.CDB）。

Result: 在RouterBench和MixInstruct数据集上，方法表现出更低的累积遗憾、更快的收敛速度，以及更好的鲁棒性和性能-成本平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在动态路由和成本效率方面优于现有基线，为LLM路由提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Motivation: 开发可信赖的人工智能需要理解模型内部计算机制，而机制可解释性（MI）的科学严谨性依赖于其发现的可靠性。

Method: 通过输入重采样、提示改写、超参数变化和因果分析中注入噪声等扰动，对EAP-IG方法进行系统性稳定性分析。

Result: EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和超参数敏感性，其发现稳定性受到质疑。

Conclusion: 建议在可解释性研究中常规报告稳定性指标，以推动更严谨和统计基础的科学实践。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

Conclusion: 为不完整数据的种群合成提供了稳健解决方案，展示了深度生成模型在该领域的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CQF方法在数据过滤中的实际效果，揭示其局限性，挑战其对数据质量的定义。

Method: 通过实验分析CQF对下游任务和语言建模的影响，并与合成数据训练模型的行为进行对比。

Result: CQF提升下游任务表现，但对高质量数据集的语言建模无显著改善；与合成数据训练模型的行为差异显著。

Conclusion: CQF并未真正捕捉数据质量的本质，其效果可能源于隐性过滤机制，而非数据质量的直接提升。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统确定性人口合成方法在处理高维数据、可扩展性和零单元问题时面临挑战，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 使用CT-GAN直接生成目标人口，或结合FBS-CO的混合方法，并与旅行调查和区域级数据对比评估。

Result: CT-GAN在单变量分布上表现最佳，但混合方法通过结合CT-GAN和FBS-CO在多变量关系上表现更好。

Conclusion: CT-GAN是有效的目标人口生成方法，结合传统技术可进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MLPs在训练过程中将结构知识和定量知识纠缠在一起，限制了效率。GLAI旨在通过分离这两种知识，提升训练效率和性能。

Method: GLAI通过固定稳定的激活模式（结构知识），仅优化数值权重和偏置（定量知识），将MLP重新表述为路径组合。

Result: GLAI在多种实验设置中匹配或超越MLPs的准确性，训练时间平均减少40%，适用于多种场景。

Conclusion: GLAI为大规模架构（如Transformers）提供了一种新的设计原则，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work we introduce GreenLightningAI (GLAI), a new architectural block
designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Conclusion: 平均绝对误差和交叉熵损失更适合强化学习中的策略优化，能有效减少次优性差距。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene
expression data analysis

Result: RiskPO在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成任务中显著优于GRPO，Pass@1和Pass@k指标均有提升。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为提升LLM推理能力提供了严谨有效的范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

Motivation: 减少依赖人工标注的成本，同时解决验证器不可靠性带来的假阴性和假阳性问题。

Method: 提出两种校正算法：反向校正（去偏二元奖励）和正向校正（重加权梯度更新），并在GRPO框架中实现。

Conclusion: 通过校正算法和轻量级LLM验证器，RLVR在数学推理任务中实现了更高效和稳定的训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战GRPO需要大组规模以确保稳定训练的假设，探索最小化rollout数量的可行性。

Method: 将GRPO重新定义为对比学习，并分析2-GRPO的理论可行性。

Result: 2-GRPO性能与16-GRPO相当，计算开销减少70%以上。

Conclusion: 2-GRPO是一种高效且可行的替代方案，显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Conclusion: RCM 为黎曼流形上的生成任务提供了高效且理论完备的解决方案。

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为S-SWIM的新算法，用于训练脉冲神经网络（SNNs），无需近似脉冲函数的梯度，提高了训练效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脉冲神经网络（SNNs）因其潜在的节能优势受到关注，但其非可微性和稀疏性使得基于梯度传播的训练方法难以应用。

Method: 通过将随机特征方法（RFMs）从人工神经网络（ANNs）扩展到脉冲响应模型（SRM）SNNs，提出S-SWIM算法，实现端到端训练。

Result: S-SWIM在时间序列预测中达到高精度，并可作为梯度训练前的有效初始化策略，性能优于随机权重采样。

Conclusion: S-SWIM为SNNs提供了一种高效、高性能且可解释的训练方法，解决了传统梯度训练中的难题。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Motivation: 在医疗筛查中，频繁进行诊断测试成本高昂，但跳过测试可能导致误分类。如何在保证错误率的同时最小化测试次数是一个重要问题。

Method: 开发了一种算法，交替进行标签收集和分布估计，计算数据驱动的阈值来决定何时进行测试。

Result: 算法在保证错误率的同时，仅需比基准多O(√T)次测试，且通过仿真验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该算法首次实现了错误约束下的无遗憾逻辑测试，适用于成本敏感的医疗筛查。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Result: ARM在多种基准和模型架构上一致提升推理性能，代码实现简单。

Conclusion: 揭示了无意义令牌的机制，并提出了一种简单有效的性能提升方法。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Result: 实验显示CurES在1.5B和7B模型上分别比GRPO提升3.30和4.82分，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: CurES通过理论分析和贝叶斯后验估计显著提升了LLM训练效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

TL;DR: Gated X-TFC是一种新颖的框架，通过软学习的域分解解决了传统方法在边界层问题中的计算效率和精度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如PINNs和X-TFC）在处理边界层问题时存在计算效率低和精度不足的问题，需要复杂的域分解或接口惩罚。

Method: 提出Gated X-TFC，使用可微分的逻辑门动态调整RBF核宽度，避免硬接口惩罚，并引入元学习层优化门配置。

Result: 在1D对流扩散问题中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差低一个数量级，计算点减少80%，训练时间减少66%。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为边界层问题提供了一种简单、高效且准确的替代方案，未来将扩展到非线性问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Conclusion: GEM作为训练和评估工具，有望加速未来LLM的代理研究。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

Result: 预填充攻击在2/3场景中最有效，logit lens和SAEs在剩余场景中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 建立了公开基准，展示了多种技术在秘密知识发现中的有效性。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for

appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this

The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Conclusion: 提出了两种优化特征维度的策略（过压缩和欠压缩），为神经网络回归的几何特性提供了新见解，并提出了提升泛化能力的实用方法。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

Result: TsLLM在需要时间序列与自然语言集成的任务上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: TsLLM为时间序列分析提供了新范式，通过自然语言交互实现高级时间推理。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力机制的联邦学习框架A3-FL，用于处理非独立同分布生物特征数据，提升隐私保护和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物特征数据敏感且集中训练存在隐私风险，联邦学习虽提供隐私保护方案，但传统方法在非独立同分布数据和可解释性上表现不佳。

Method: 在中央服务器引入注意力机制，动态加权本地模型更新，结合差分隐私和安全更新协议保护数据。使用Siamese-CNN提取特征。

Result: A3-FL在FVC2004指纹数据上表现优于FedAvg和静态基线，准确率达0.8413，差分隐私下仍保持0.8330。

Conclusion: A3-FL为分散环境提供了一种可扩展且隐私敏感的生物特征识别系统，兼顾安全性和效率。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: COUNTS框架通过强化学习训练LLM，使其在时间序列任务中实现Chain-of-Thought推理，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列模型缺乏多步推理能力，而LLM在时间序列任务中表现不佳，需要新方法。

Method: 使用Residual Vector-Quantized VAE生成离散标记，结合两阶段训练（监督微调和强化学习）。

Result: COUNTS显著提升了LLM在时间序列任务中的性能。

Conclusion: COUNTS为复杂时间序列推理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出一种将生物序列特征映射到双曲面空间的方法，以改进序列分类和相似性测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在高维欧几里得空间中难以捕捉序列数据的复杂关系和层次结构，影响分类和相似性测量的准确性。

Method: 将生物序列特征转换为双曲面空间表示，计算基于双曲面特征的核矩阵以捕获序列间相似性。

Result: 实验证明该方法能有效捕捉序列相关性并提高分类准确性。

Conclusion: 双曲面空间表示能更好地保留序列结构信息，提升分析效果。

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR)的方法，通过并行生成、蒸馏和精炼思想，以更低的延迟和计算成本实现比长链思维（long CoT）更高的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长链思维（long CoT）虽然能提高模型准确性，但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和延迟。研究旨在探索是否可以通过模型的元认知能力找到更优的权衡方案。

Method: 提出PDR方法，包括并行生成多样草稿、蒸馏到有限文本工作空间、以及基于工作空间精炼输出。还探讨了Sequential Refinement (SR)作为PDR的特例。

Result: PDR和SR在数学任务中表现优于长链思维，PDR在AIME 2024和2025上分别提升11%和9%。

Conclusion: 通过模型编排和训练，可以优化推理方法的性能，PDR展示了在准确性和效率上的显著改进。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Motivation: 现有框架和定义分散，缺乏对设计选择如何影响任务表现的系统分析，论文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 将设计空间分解为环境、奖励和策略三个支柱，通过实验分析任务复杂性、奖励稀疏性和策略梯度方法的影响。

Result: 发现简单环境能提供泛化信号，密集奖励加速训练但依赖算法选择，策略梯度方法的选择与奖励稀疏性相关。

Conclusion: 总结了一套训练方法，指导三个支柱的协同设计，促进多轮代理强化学习的研究和实践。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的语言模型后训练方法对批处理和提示选择策略敏感，需要一种更高效的方法来平衡性能和计算成本。

Method: PCL 使用一个动态更新的价值模型来选择中等难度的提示，避免了昂贵的滚动计算，并优化了训练过程。

Result: PCL 在 MATH 和 DeepScaleR 数据集上分别实现了 12.1 倍和 16.9 倍的速度提升，同时保持了高性能。

Conclusion: PCL 提供了一种新的方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了性能与效率的更好平衡。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

TL;DR: TabINR是一种基于隐式神经表示（INR）的自动解码器框架，用于表格数据的高质量填补，表现出色且适应性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的表格数据常因收集错误、隐私限制或传感器故障而不完整，简单填补策略易引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，因此需要高质量、鲁棒且快速的填补方法。

Method: TabINR通过可学习的行和特征嵌入处理表格数据的离散结构，利用部分观测实现实例自适应填补，无需修改训练模型。

Result: 在12个真实数据集和多种缺失机制下，TabINR表现优异，通常优于经典方法（如KNN、MICE）和深度学习模型（如GAIN）。

Conclusion: TabINR在表格数据填补中表现出色，尤其在高维数据集上优势明显。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Motivation: DP-SGD在提供强隐私保证的同时，增加的噪声会显著增加梯度矩阵的熵，破坏其低秩结构并减缓优化过程。

Method: 提出一种基于随机矩阵理论的后处理算法，用于去噪梯度、恢复低秩结构并提高与原始信号的对齐。

Result: 在RoBERTa的GLUE任务微调中，该方法提高了样本效率，显著减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的情况下提升私有语言模型训练的实用性。

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法在动态建模中表现出色，具有通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

Motivation: 现有异步RL方法在高陈旧数据下性能下降或崩溃，M2PO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: M2PO通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩，抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新。

Result: M2PO在高陈旧数据下显著减少裁剪标记比例（从1.22%降至0.06%），并在多个模型和基准测试中匹配在线策略性能。

Conclusion: M2PO证明了陈旧数据在适当利用下可以像在线数据一样有效，为异步RL提供了稳定且高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Result: 研究发现预训练分布的统计属性（如尾部行为、覆盖范围）对ICL的样本效率、任务检索和鲁棒性起关键作用。

Conclusion: 控制预训练分布的关键统计属性是构建具备ICL能力且可靠的LLM的关键。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有示例搜索方法仅优化预测准确性，忽视了模型校准，影响可信度和安全部署。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro基准测试中，COM-BOM在联合优化准确性和校准方面优于或匹配基线方法。

Conclusion: COM-BOM高效解决了示例选择问题，显著减少了LLM API调用次数。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

TL;DR: Toucan是一个高质量、开源的LLM代理训练数据集，包含150万条轨迹，解决了现有数据在多样性和复杂性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源社区缺乏高质量、多样化的工具代理训练数据，限制了LLM代理的发展。

Method: 通过真实MCP环境生成多样化任务，结合模型过滤和教师模型生成轨迹，并通过验证机制确保质量。

Result: 在BFCL V3和MCP-Universe Bench上，基于Toucan微调的模型表现优于闭源模型。

Conclusion: Toucan填补了开源工具代理数据的空白，推动了LLM代理的性能提升。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

TL;DR: RLVR通过增加每次训练的rollout数量（BroRL）来提升性能，突破了ProRL在训练步数增加时的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ProRL在增加训练步数时性能会达到瓶颈，而BroRL通过增加rollout数量来持续提升性能。

Method: 通过质量平衡方程分析，增加rollout数量（N）来确保正确token的概率质量增加。

Result: BroRL在3K ProRL训练步数后仍能持续提升性能，并在1.5B模型上取得SOTA结果。

Conclusion: BroRL是一种有效的RL扩展方法，通过增加rollout数量实现持续性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种机制，通过调整去噪扩散和流匹配模型的采样多样性，用户可以从比训练分布更尖锐或更宽的分布中采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型利用噪声数据分布的得分函数进行采样，但缺乏对采样多样性的直接控制。

Method: 通过重新缩放得分函数来控制局部采样温度，无需微调或改变训练策略，适用于现成模型和确定性/随机采样器。

Result: 在2D数据和五个不同任务（图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作、蛋白质设计）中验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能灵活调整采样分布，提升模型性能，例如深度预测模型受益于更可能的深度估计，而图像生成模型在稍平坦的分布中表现更好。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)的新方法，用于提升稀疏专家混合模型（MoE）的专家专业化能力，解决了现有方法中路由分配低置信度的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在将预训练密集模型升级为稀疏MoE时，因简单的权重复制导致专家专业化不足，路由分配效果差。

Method: 引入DPSL，通过匹配专家分配与目标Dirichlet先验分布，直接优化路由概率分布，从而精细控制专家平衡和专业化。

Result: 实验表明，DPSL在多个视觉-语言基准测试中优于现有方法，显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: DPSL是一种通用工具，不仅适用于MoE训练，还能编码归纳偏置，提升模型的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.
