RoPE-based interpolation and\nextrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,\nenable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training\nquantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining\nRoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled\neffects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy\nfrom axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that\nproduces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our\nknowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce\ntwo practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to\nphase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long\ncontexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,\nRoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,\ninterpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE\ndimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight\nsearch over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional\nsymmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our\ndiagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no\nfine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional\ndeployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on\nlong-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context\nperformance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system\nstacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faQ-ROAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3RoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u63d2\u503c\u4e0e\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u5c55\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u652f\u6301\u5bf9\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46RoPE\u63d2\u503c\u4e0e\u91cf\u5316\u7ed3\u5408\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQ-ROAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u7ec4RoPE\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5e76\u8f7b\u91cf\u641c\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u52a8\u3002", "result": "Q-ROAR\u964d\u4f4e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea614%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u77ed\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Q-ROAR\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In\nparallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the\nsensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their\ncognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,\ngeneralization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by\nreal-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,\nand GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge\ncomputing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that\ntogether enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with\nreality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time\ninteraction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,\nbandwidth, and latency.

A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural\nordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into\nthe design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world\nordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution\n(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will\noften be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood\nmodels, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it\nwas also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have\nvalues of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be\nnon-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for\nsuch a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose\napproximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal\nCPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal.

However, training and deploying these\nmodels is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a\nquadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring\nefficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these\nlimitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks\n(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,\nusing existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On\nthe other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to\ntheir SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes\nat the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To\naddress this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing\ntransformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach\nwith existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)\nreplacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),\n(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its\nequivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate\nlearning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its\naccuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing\nmodel size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a\n5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block\nand show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption\nwhen implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5NeurTransformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08SNN\uff09\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "1. \u7528\u8109\u51b2\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08SSA\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b2. \u5c06\u524d\u9988\u5757\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3aSNN\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528SNN\u4ee3\u7406\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5fae\u8c03SSA\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u5728GPT-2\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u635f\u59315-12%\uff0c\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e9.7%\uff0c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u534764.71%-85.28%\u3002", "conclusion": "NeurTransformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u80fd\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SNN\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

This paper\nintroduce NeuRO, a integrated learning-to-optimize framework that tightly\ncouples perception networks with downstream task-level robust optimization.\nSpecifically, NeuRO addresses core difficulties in this integration: (i) it\ntransforms noisy visual predictions under data scarcity into convex uncertainty\nsets using Partially Input Convex Neural Networks (PICNNs) with conformal\ncalibration, which directly parameterize the optimization constraints; and (ii)\nit reformulates planning under partial observability as a robust optimization\nproblem, enabling uncertainty-aware policies that transfer across environments.\nExtensive experiments on both unordered and sequential multi-object navigation\ntasks demonstrate that NeuRO establishes SoTA performance, particularly in\ngeneralization to unseen environments. Our work thus presents a significant\nadvancement for developing robust, generalizable autonomous agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuRO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u611f\u77e5\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u5bfc\u822a\u5728\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0fAI\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9700\u8981\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u6765\u5904\u7406\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5c0f\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3002", "method": "NeuRO\u4f7f\u7528\u90e8\u5206\u8f93\u5165\u51f8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08PICNNs\uff09\u548c\u4fdd\u5f62\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u51f8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u5e8f\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNeuRO\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "NeuRO\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u4ee3\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, for practical\nproblems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due\nto computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human\nfeedback.

We\nformalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from\nlimited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates\nthe study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection\nstrategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free\ninformation such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)\nstrategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that\ncritical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal\ntrajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after\ndeviations.

To address this issue, we propose a two-stage\noutlier detection method and apply the method in a tightly coupled GNSS-RTK,\ninertial navigation system (INS), and odometer integration based on factor\ngraph optimization (FGO). In the first stage, Doppler measurements are employed\nto detect pseudo-range outliers in a GNSS-only manner, since Doppler is less\nsensitive to multipath and NLOS effects compared with pseudo-range, making it a\nmore stable reference for detecting sudden inconsistencies. In the second\nstage, pre-integrated inertial measurement units (IMU) and odometer constraints\nare used to generate predicted double-difference pseudo-range measurements,\nwhich enable a more refined identification and rejection of remaining outliers.\nBy combining these two complementary stages, the system achieves improved\nrobustness against both gross pseudo-range errors and degraded satellite\nmeasuring quality.

Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies\nin existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime\noverhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,\nthey miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA\nadapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to\nmissed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication\noverlap, and improved GPU load balance.\n  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA\nfine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting\nmethod that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary\nmemory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without\nincurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling\nlevel, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job\nfine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger\nbatch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each\ngroup to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches.

However, most existing Vision-Language-Action\nmodels (VLAs) have been designed without considering this aspect, i.e., they\nrely solely on the current observation, ignoring preceding context. In this\npaper, we propose HAMLET, a scalable framework to adapt VLAs to attend to the\nhistorical context during action prediction. Specifically, we introduce moment\ntokens that compactly encode perceptual information at each timestep. Their\nrepresentations are initialized with time-contrastive learning, allowing them\nto better capture temporally distinctive aspects. Next, we employ a lightweight\nmemory module that integrates the moment tokens across past timesteps into\nmemory features, which are then leveraged for action prediction. Through\nempirical evaluation, we show that HAMLET successfully transforms a\nstate-of-the-art VLA into a history-aware policy, especially demonstrating\nsignificant improvements on long-horizon tasks that require historical context.\nIn particular, on top of GR00T N1.5, HAMLET achieves an average success rate of\n76.4% on history-dependent real-world tasks, surpassing the baseline\nperformance by 47.2%.

We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on\ntwo decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a\ndifferent conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from\nfrozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT\nmodels cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.\nIntroducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields\nstrong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming\nin-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can\ngeneralize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision\nprovides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more\ndifficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and\narithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that\nincrease combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT\nachieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both\ninstruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL\nbaselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.\nThese findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL\nand support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated\ndemonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL.

To address these issues, this paper proposes the first Random-to-Target\nFabric Flattening (RTFF) policy, which aligns a random wrinkled fabric state to\nan arbitrary wrinkle-free target state. The proposed policy adopts a hybrid\nImitation Learning-Visual Servoing (IL-VS) framework, where IL learns with\nexplicit fabric models for coarse alignment of the wrinkled fabric toward a\nwrinkle-free state near the target, and VS ensures fine alignment to the\ntarget. Central to this framework is a template-based mesh that offers precise\ntarget state representation, wrinkle-aware geometry prediction, and consistent\nvertex correspondence across RTFF manipulation steps, enabling robust\nmanipulation and seamless IL-VS switching. Leveraging the power of mesh, a\nnovel IL solution for RTFF-Mesh Action Chunking Transformer (MACT)-is then\nproposed by conditioning the mesh information into a Transformer-based policy.\nThe RTFF policy is validated on a real dual-arm tele-operation system, showing\nzero-shot alignment to different targets, high accuracy, and strong\ngeneralization across fabrics and scales.

To address this limitation, we propose a more practical\napproach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages\nboth normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection\nacross diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning\n(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and\nAnomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from\nnormal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly\nrepresentations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images\nthrough residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach\neffectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and\nefficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple\nbenchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD\napproaches.

One reason for this is the \"prior hole\" problem. A prior\nhole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low\nprobability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,\nhigh probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the\nposterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be\nflexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate\nsamples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper\nproposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are\nknown to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the\nELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency\non MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the\nnormalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.\nThe variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show\nthat such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating\noptimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit\nvariational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling.

Yet their advancement is constrained by the high cost of\nacquiring large-scale interaction datasets. This work introduces an alternative\nparadigm for enhancing policy performance without additional model training.\nPerhaps surprisingly, we demonstrate that the composed policies can exceed the\nperformance of either parent policy. Our contribution is threefold. First, we\nestablish a theoretical foundation showing that the convex composition of\ndistributional scores from multiple diffusion models can yield a superior\none-step functional objective compared to any individual score. A\nGr\\\"onwall-type bound is then used to show that this single-step improvement\npropagates through entire generation trajectories, leading to systemic\nperformance gains. Second, motivated by these results, we propose General\nPolicy Composition (GPC), a training-free method that enhances performance by\ncombining the distributional scores of multiple pre-trained policies via a\nconvex combination and test-time search. GPC is versatile, allowing for the\nplug-and-play composition of heterogeneous policies, including VA and VLA\nmodels, as well as those based on diffusion or flow-matching, irrespective of\ntheir input visual modalities. Third, we provide extensive empirical\nvalidation. Experiments on Robomimic, PushT, and RoboTwin benchmarks, alongside\nreal-world robotic evaluations, confirm that GPC consistently improves\nperformance and adaptability across a diverse set of tasks. Further analysis of\nalternative composition operators and weighting strategies offers insights into\nthe mechanisms underlying the success of GPC.

In this\nwork, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables\nefficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length.

In particular,\nwe introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to\ngenerate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions\neventually.

However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics\ninto the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both\ncontent preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present\nmulti-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that\nreengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an\ninnovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a\nmulti-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid\nrepresentation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the\nmulti-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic\nstyle injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and\nadaptively integrates them into the content patterns.

In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian\nmulti-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the\nperformance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher\nvariance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.\nWhile the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results\nsuggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for\nenhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPPT\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u51b3\u7b56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u51b3\u7b56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08DPTs\uff09\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPPT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f85\u52a9\u5956\u52b1\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f5c\u4e3a\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cPPT\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u597d\u5947\u5fc3\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Consistency Models (CMs), which are\ntrained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential\nequation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion\nsampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch\nsizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the\ntraining dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM\noutput update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move\nparallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate\noscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold\nfeature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point\ntoward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent\n(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform\nthe learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we\nfind that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without\ncompromising sample quality.

Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal\ncomponent analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,\nboth strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow\nseparation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep\nlearning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly\nseparating tissue and blood flow signals.

Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity\nscore in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they\neither involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively\nutilize structural and scale information of graphs.

By incorporating the node\nfeatures and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,\ngraph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and\nthe volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph\nregions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions\nand adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED\nand propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis\nenables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global\nstructural information.

By establishing and comparing to the analysis of\nlinear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may\nrequire more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions\neven when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear\nTransformer can tolerate.

Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches\naddress this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and\nhinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding\nspace. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them\npromising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale\ndifferences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature\ncounts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted\nsubtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.\nAdditionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for\nmatched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications.

To\naddress this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that\nperforms on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's\nevolving influence on model optimization.

To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel\nevaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground\ntruth images.

By\ndirectly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies\nthat signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing\nrobustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing\nevaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic\nevaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,\nground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises\nthese alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional\nmisalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging\nand refinement.

These approaches\ntrain ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,\nwhich often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering\nfrom the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual\nautoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong\nT2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the\nbitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we\nintroduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive\nModeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation\nnetwork is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary\nscales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive\nfine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without\ncompromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative\nevaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual\nresults over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference\nspeed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality\nof input images, showing stronger generalization performance.

While recent studies have begun to explore the\npotential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically\nlack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we\nstrive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred\ninto Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a\ngenerative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting\nlatents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of\nmodels, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that\ngenerative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding\nthat show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing\nvariant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method\nsignificantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image\nmodels to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of\nvisual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and\nproprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We\nattribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization\nfrom video pre-training.

Optical coherence\ntomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering\nhigh-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the\nconventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D\nreports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,\nwe propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention\nmechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the\nextraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as\nwell as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We\nintroduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize\ncross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task\nfine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps\n(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,\ninterpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D\n(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed\nCross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two\naxes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification\nby capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating\ninformation from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on\ntwo large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and\nconvolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is\ncomputationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold\ncompared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic\nperformance and comparable GFLOPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578bAI-CNet3D\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c3D CNN\uff0c\u4eceOCT\u4f53\u79ef\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c063D OCT\u4f53\u79ef\u538b\u7f29\u4e3a2D\u62a5\u544a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c3D CNN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5272\u4f53\u79ef\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6765\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u5934\u548c\u9ec4\u6591\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5377\u79ef\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "AI-CNet3D\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

The method combines coarse\nalignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of\nlandmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.\nTrained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net\nachieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant\nanatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to\nintra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further\nevaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise\nerror of 0.41\\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\\,mm. Compared to existing\nmethods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and\ncomputational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh\nquality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy\nacross most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets\nand facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and\nstructural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for\nhigh-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical\nworkflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation.

We integrate\nPANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and\nAnnoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,\nSIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.\nExperiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to\nmodern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate\nthat PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "PANORAMA\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\u4f18\u5316ANNS\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u67e5\u8be2\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "ANNS\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9636\u6bb5\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u5019\u9009\u526a\u679d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02-30\u500d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "PANORAMA\u4e3aANNS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing video\nsuper-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when\nprocessing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step\ndenoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by\ntemporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break\nthese limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an\nautoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference\nwhile fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the\npre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global\ncoherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill\nthe diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel\nsupervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs\nenable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap\nin long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended\nsequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively\nassess temporal consistency.

These\nprivacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization\nmethods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure\nscheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person\nauthentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized\nimages but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties\ncan reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the\nfirst secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion\nmodel. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces\nrepresentation of the diffusion model.

Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,\nsuch as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,\ngradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While\nthese optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage\nconvergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby\nresisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with\nrandomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust\nunlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that\ncombines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy\nwhile enhancing robustness.

Unlike\nconventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize\noptimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and\nreward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes\nthem especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial\noptimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to\noverexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,\nparticularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,\nimproving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing\ndiversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we\nintegrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets\nsampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation\ntoward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to\nbalance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a\ncontrollable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness.

In district heating networks,\nsensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal\ninconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper\npresents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using\nvisual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The\ndashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series\nplots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and\nanomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the\nmodified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret\ndata anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality\nassessment.

We argue that\nthese issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while\nneglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,\nwe propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical\nmean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce\na Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over\nmultiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient\nsignals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We\nfurther design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into\nbundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and\ninformative training dynamics.

To reduce vulnerability to\nverifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\\{0,1\\}$ during\ntraining. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \\textit{false negatives}\n(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \\textit{false positives} (accepting\nincorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct\nfraction $\\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical\n$\\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large\nlanguage model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single\nadversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We\nformalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic\nreward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive\ntwo correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \\textit{backward}\ncorrection that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an\n\\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a\n\\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the\nexpected update direction aligns with the \\textit{clean gradient}; notably, it\nrequires only the FN rate.

To address these\nchallenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature\nrepresentation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space.

This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,\ntoken/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage\ntheir metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,\ne.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we\nview the model as an improvement operator on its own \"thoughts\" with a\ncontinuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family\nParallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate\ndiverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual\nworkspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output\nthat seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is\ncontrollable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the\ntotal number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current\nmodels that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.\nSetting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential\nRefinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides\nperformance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises\nthe question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this\nend, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it\nconsistent with PDR as the inference method.

Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the\nnumber of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of\nsteps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to\nadditional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for\nscaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to\nexhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains\nbeyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of\ntraining steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis\nallowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct\nand incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a\none-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to\ncorrect-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to\ngains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.\nImportantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of\nunsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To\nvalidate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed\nconditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to\nample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct\ntokens.
