In particular,\nstate-of-the-art zero-shot image inverse solvers leverage distilled\ntext-to-image latent diffusion models (LDMs) to achieve unprecedented accuracy\nand perceptual quality with high computational efficiency. However, extending\nthese advances to high-definition video restoration remains a significant\nchallenge, due to the need to recover fine spatial detail while capturing\nsubtle temporal dependencies. Consequently, methods that naively apply\nimage-based LDM priors on a frame-by-frame basis often result in temporally\ninconsistent reconstructions. We address this challenge by leveraging recent\nadvances in Video Consistency Models (VCMs), which distill video latent\ndiffusion models into fast generators that explicitly capture temporal\ncausality. Building on this foundation, we propose LVTINO, the first zero-shot\nor plug-and-play inverse solver for high definition video restoration with\npriors encoded by VCMs. Our conditioning mechanism bypasses the need for\nautomatic differentiation and achieves state-of-the-art video reconstruction\nquality with only a few neural function evaluations, while ensuring strong\nmeasurement consistency and smooth temporal transitions across frames.\nExtensive experiments on a diverse set of video inverse problems show\nsignificant perceptual improvements over current state-of-the-art methods that\napply image LDMs frame by frame, establishing a new benchmark in both\nreconstruction fidelity and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "LVTINO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08VCMs\uff09\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6216\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u9006\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6e05\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e27\u95f4\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08LDMs\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u8fde\u8d2f\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff08VCMs\uff09\u6355\u83b7\u65f6\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLVTINO\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u81ea\u52a8\u5fae\u5206\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLVTINO\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LVTINO\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6062\u590d\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Towards addressing\nthis, we introduce VENTURA, a vision-language navigation system that finetunes\ninternet-pretrained image diffusion models for path planning. Instead of\ndirectly predicting low-level actions, VENTURA generates a path mask (i.e. a\nvisual plan) in image space that captures fine-grained, context-aware\nnavigation behaviors. A lightweight behavior-cloning policy grounds these\nvisual plans into executable trajectories, yielding an interface that follows\nnatural language instructions to generate diverse robot behaviors.

In extensive real-world\nevaluations, VENTURA outperforms state-of-the-art foundation model baselines on\nobject reaching, obstacle avoidance, and terrain preference tasks, improving\nsuccess rates by 33% and reducing collisions by 54% across both seen and unseen\nscenarios.

However, their exponentially\nincreasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on\nresource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for\nlow-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key\nchallenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In\nthis paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit\nquantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that\neffectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity\nGuidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced\nRiemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity\ndirections in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed\nalong the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses\nerror expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which\nconstructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to\ndynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally\noptimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments\ndemonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in\n2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by\n0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy.

To address this, we propose a unified deep\nlearning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while\nsimultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach\nintegrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning,\nenabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical\nsegmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires\nno initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder\nand decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training\nstrategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common\nconstraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of\n264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task\nand multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61\ndB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation,\nit improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus\nDice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to\nmore accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm\nfrom 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to\nnnU-Net.

In this paper, we present\nRLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the\ncore spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of\npretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory\naction, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for\npredicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the\nmodel to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an\nindependent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the\nreward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when\nconditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to\nconditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense\nreward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream\nduring pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for\nreasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between\nnext-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning.\nPretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an\neight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%.

To address these challenges, we introduce a\ncooperative robotic guidance system that applies haptic feedback for tumor\nlocalization. In this pilot study, we aim to assess if and how this system can\nbe successfully integrated into breast cancer care.\n  Methods: A small haptic robot is retrofitted with an electrocautery blade to\noperate as a cooperatively controlled surgical tool. Ultrasound and\nelectromagnetic navigation are used to identify the tumor boundaries and\nposition. A forbidden region virtual fixture is imposed when the surgical tool\ncollides with the tumor boundary. We conducted a study where users were asked\nto resect tumors from breast simulants both with and without the haptic\nguidance. We then assess the results of these simulated resections both\nqualitatively and quantitatively.\n  Results: Virtual fixture guidance is shown to improve resection margins. On\naverage, users find the task to be less mentally demanding, frustrating, and\neffort intensive when haptic feedback is available. We also discovered some\nunanticipated impacts on surgical workflow that will guide design adjustments\nand training protocol moving forward.\n  Conclusion: Our results suggest that virtual fixtures can help localize tumor\nboundaries in simulated breast-conserving surgery.

The submission\n  includes 10 pages and 6 figures", "summary": "Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks,\nincluding safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased\nmaintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their\nreliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification.\nThis tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free\nReinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely\nfrom observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit\nstructural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training\nmust occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However,\nduring this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it\nexerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the\nstructure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a\nLinear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies\non an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations\nindicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model\noutperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce\na hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this\napproach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its\nparameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an\napproximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This\nhybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while\nminimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our\nknowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety\nchallenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LQR\u548cRL\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u632f\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u800c\u7eafRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u53ef\u80fd\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u9020\u6210\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u6a21\u578b\u7684LQR\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5f15\u5bfcRL\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e2\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u964d\u4f4e\u63a2\u7d22\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u63a7\u5236\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u4e86RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u635f\u5bb3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RL\u632f\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Delay\nreflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and\nemissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative;\nHowever, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data\nfollow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in\nreal-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver\nbehavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced\nmodel accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain\nadaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse\nintersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains,\nextracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled\nsubset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with\nBalanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the\ntarget domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from\n57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is\nevaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven\ninstance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides\nmore accurate and robust delay estimates.

In RoboCasa simulation,\nSymSkill can execute 12 single-step tasks with 85% success rate.

Large-scale pre-trained diffusion\nmodels, which are rich in true-world modeling, have shown great promise for\nhigh-quality image restoration tasks such as deblurring, demonstrating stronger\ngenerative capabilities than CNN and transformer-based methods. However,\nchallenges such as unbearable inference time and compromised fidelity still\nlimit the full potential of the diffusion models. To address this, we introduce\nFideDiff, a novel single-step diffusion model designed for high-fidelity\ndeblurring. We reformulate motion deblurring as a diffusion-like process where\neach timestep represents a progressively blurred image, and we train a\nconsistency model that aligns all timesteps to the same clean image. By\nreconstructing training data with matched blur trajectories, the model learns\ntemporal consistency, enabling accurate one-step deblurring. We further enhance\nmodel performance by integrating Kernel ControlNet for blur kernel estimation\nand introducing adaptive timestep prediction.

Considering actuator dynamics is essential for more effective and\nreliable operation, particularly during aggressive flight maneuvers or recovery\nfrom sudden disturbances. While prior studies have investigated actuator-aware\ncontrol for conventional and fixed-tilt multirotors, these approaches rely on\nlinear relationships between actuator input and wrench, which cannot capture\nthe nonlinearities induced by variable tilt angles. In this work, we exploit\nthe cascade structure between the rigid-body dynamics of the multirotor and its\nnonlinear actuator dynamics to design the proposed backstepping controller and\nestablish exponential stability of the overall system. Furthermore, we reveal\nparametric uncertainty in the actuator model through experiments, and we\ndemonstrate that the proposed controller remains robust against such\nuncertainty. The controller was compared against a baseline that does not\naccount for actuator dynamics across three experimental scenarios: fast\ntranslational tracking, rapid rotational tracking, and recovery from sudden\ndisturbance.

These\nmethods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption\nthat the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or \"important\", under the\ntest distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating\nthis assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of\nanisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural\nclassifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its\nrandomly augmented equivalent.

Some\nrecent works have attempted to simultaneously remove image inconsistencies and\nperform reconstruction by integrating image degradation modeling into neural 3D\nscene representations.However, these methods rely heavily on dense observations\nfor robustly optimizing model parameters.To address this issue, we propose to\ndecouple robust reconstruction into two subtasks: restoration and\nreconstruction, which naturally simplifies the optimization process.To this\nend, we introduce UniVerse, a unified framework for robust reconstruction based\non a video diffusion model. Specifically, UniVerse first converts inconsistent\nimages into initial videos, then uses a specially designed video diffusion\nmodel to restore them into consistent images, and finally reconstructs the 3D\nscenes from these restored images.Compared with case-by-case per-view\ndegradation modeling, the diffusion model learns a general scene prior from\nlarge-scale data, making it applicable to diverse image\ninconsistencies.Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the strong generalization capability and superior performance of\nour method in robust reconstruction. Moreover, UniVerse can control the style\nof the reconstructed 3D scene.

Preference optimization,\nwhich trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred\nresponses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning\nLLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is\nunrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments.\nThis paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization,\nproviding generalization guarantees under these conditions.

Unlike traditional analyses that assume\nconvergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering\nnew insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how\ngeneralization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise\nrates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples.

Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box\noptimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a\ntheoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model\nso as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced\nexploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto\nchoice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla\nBO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping\nwith high-dimensional counterparts with {\\it irregular} variables (e.g.,\ncategorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates\nhave been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the\nLLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input\nvariables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we\nleverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters\ntogether with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational\nBayesian last layer (VBLL) framework.

Finally, we demonstrate that the visual policy trained\nwith PGR in FalconGym 2.0 can be zero-shot sim-to-real transferred to a\nquadrotor hardware, achieving a 98.6% success rate (69 / 70 gates) over 30\ntrials spanning two three-gate tracks and a moving-gate track.", "AI": {"tldr": "FalconGym 2.0\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PGR\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4eff\u771f\u5230\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u822a\u8ff9\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1FalconGym 2.0\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51faPGR\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u6311\u6218\u6027\u822a\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5355\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u822a\u8ff9\u4e0a100%\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u8fbe98.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "PGR\u7b97\u6cd5\u548cFalconGym 2.0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Current approaches\naddress this gap by retargeting human motion data to humanoid embodiments and\nthen training reinforcement learning (RL) policies to imitate these reference\ntrajectories. However, artifacts introduced during retargeting, such as foot\nsliding, self-penetration, and physically infeasible motion are often left in\nthe reference trajectories for the RL policy to correct.

The transformer backbone enables more effective\nmodeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion\nrefinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor\ndetails.\n  This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and\nscalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines.\nExperimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent\ngains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of\ntransformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor\nsegmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VGDM\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5377\u79ef\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5982U-Net\uff09\u5728\u6355\u6349\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u590d\u6742\u80bf\u7624\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u7ec6\u5316\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVGDM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5d4c\u5165\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u53bb\u566a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4f53\u79ef\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "result": "\u5728MRI\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cVGDM\u5728Dice\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "VGDM\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u8111\u80bf\u7624\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This alignment typically requires\nfine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time\nalignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative,\nmodifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards\ngenerating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward\nhacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate\nsignificantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization\nis insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit\nimage-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward\nhAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an\nimage-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory\nwith a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can\nincrease without off-distribution drift (reward hacking).

Directly projecting 2D\nfeatures into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing\ngeometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale\nannotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant\nsegmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with\n3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the\n2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated\nfeatures.

With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow\nmatching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly\nstronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based\nediting has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the\nfirst framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based\nediting, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first\nshow that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly:\nunlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently\nstructured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To\novercome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm,\nwhere affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature\nsupervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization\nadapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving\nbackground fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities.\nFor evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench)\nfeaturing region-level dragging instructions.

However, their reliance on transformer\narchitectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when\nextending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive\nformulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from\nshort-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models\ncannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their\ntraining horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from\nthe compounding of errors within the continuous latent space.

When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of\ngenerating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the\nmaximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x\nlonger than that of our baseline model.

To address this\nlimitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video\ngeneration that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and\neffects.

This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free\ncross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are\ncompletely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware\ndynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled\nsource-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is\nbuilt upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale\nvision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal\ngeneralizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain\nshift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a\nfrequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while\nsuppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware\naugmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label\nproblem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy\nwhere the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,\nthus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the\nissue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant\nanalysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification\nis performed using the linear discriminant analysis approach guided by the\nrandom kernel method.

While both models\neffectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location\nchoices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM\nbetter aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes\non workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs\nperform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings\nunderscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific\napplication requirements in workplace location choice analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNN\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4f5c\u5730\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff08DCM\uff09\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3\u590d\u6742\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u9009\u62e9\u6a21\u578b\uff08DCM\uff09\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4e2a\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5de5\u4f5c\u5730\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DNN\uff09\u5efa\u6a21\u5de5\u4f5c\u5730\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edfDCM\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "DNN\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8eDCM\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5de5\u4f5c\u5730\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff1b\u800cDCM\u5728\u77ed\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c5e\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u9002\u5408\u7279\u5b9a\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u5730\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cDNN\u548cDCM\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Training neural networks with\ndifferentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the\nmodel's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output.

While the majority of studies on the topic\nreport a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that\nfairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing\nhyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models\n(rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common\npractice).

We highlight that\na disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact\non another.

We\nstress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional\nprivacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy,\nutility and fairness.

Existing MTS anomaly\ndetection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based,\nprediction-based, and classifier-based methods.

GraphNC includes two main components,\nanomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality\nregularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by\naligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to\naccurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in\nthe teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of\nthe normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more\nseparable anomaly scores.

In this study, we\nintroduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address\nbias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically\nselecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised\ncontrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data.

When\nevaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source\nfree5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;\nPUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training\ndatasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its\ncounterpart Inter-Slice Defender and other PUL based solutions combining\nOne-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) with Random Forest and XGBoost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPUL-Inter-Slice Defender\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u62a45G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u514d\u53d7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5207\u7247\u79fb\u52a8\uff08DSM\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6b63\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PUL\uff09\u3001\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cK-Means\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u6c61\u67d3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "5G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\uff08UE\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7f51\u7edc\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u65e0\u7f1d\u5207\u6362\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u5229\u7528\u53d1\u8d77DSM\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u62d2\u7edd\u670d\u52a1\uff08DDoS\uff09\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6b63\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u5b66\u4e60\uff08PUL\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u957f\u77ed\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cK-Means\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5229\u75283GPP\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6d4b\u91cf\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4bDSM\u653b\u51fb\u53d8\u79cd\u3002", "result": "\u57285G\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cPUL-Inter-Slice Defender\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u4e3a10%\u81f340%\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aF1\u5206\u6570\u8d85\u8fc798.50%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "PUL-Inter-Slice Defender\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa15G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684DSM\u653b\u51fb\u3002"}}
