We\ninvestigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt,\nmodels time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens\nwith text tokens via soft prompting.

Recently, radar technologies, such as ultra-wideband (UWB) have\nemerged as potential alternatives due to their ability to see through adverse\nenvironmental conditions (e.g. dust, smoke and rain). However, due to the small\napertures with low directivity, the UWB radars cannot reconstruct a detailed\nimage of its field of view (FOV) using a single scan. Hence, a virtual large\naperture is synthesized by moving the radar along a mobile robot path. The\nresulting synthetic aperture radar (SAR) image is a high-definition\nrepresentation of the surrounding environment. Hence, this paper proposes a\npipeline for mobile robots to incorporate UWB radar-based SAR imaging to map an\nunknown environment. Finally, we evaluated the performance of classical feature\ndetectors: SIFT, SURF, BRISK, AKAZE and ORB to identify loop closures using UWB\nSAR images. The experiments were conducted emulating adverse environmental\nconditions. The results demonstrate the viability and effectiveness of UWB SAR\nimaging for high-resolution environmental mapping and loop closure detection\ntoward more robust and reliable robotic perception systems."}

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically\ninspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for\nimage data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample\ngeneration starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST,\nFashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the\nnew scheme.

This can be expressed in a\nclosed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network\narchitectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for\nspecific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free,\narchitecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show\nstate-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time,\nestablish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including\nstereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and\npracticality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our\nmethod recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9%\non stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of\nadversarial attacks."}

To date,\ncontinual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of\nrisk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected\n(or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal\ntheoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware\ndecision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of\nlong-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical\ntheory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in\nnon-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the\ncontinual setting.

Recent advances in\ncomputational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient\ndescent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological\nsystems.

One such approach is inspired by Dale's law,\nwhich states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during\nthe course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization\nscheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the\ndensity that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the\nstochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is\nthe log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE\ngoverning geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the\ncorresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which\nsurprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential\ngradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new\nformalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss\nfunction proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally\ndistributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns\nout to be a natural fit.

Our approach introduces the joint energy-force negative\nlog-likelihood (NLL$_\\text{JEF}$) loss function, which explicitly models\nuncertainty in both energies and interatomic forces, yielding superior accuracy\ncompared to conventional NLL losses. We systematically benchmark multiple\nBayesian approaches, including deep ensembles with mean-variance estimation,\nstochastic weight averaging Gaussian, improved variational online Newton, and\nlaplace approximation by evaluating their performance on uncertainty\nprediction, OOD detection, calibration, and active learning tasks. We further\ndemonstrate that NLL$_\\text{JEF}$ facilitates efficient active learning by\nquantifying energy and force uncertainties. Using Bayesian active learning by\ndisagreement (BALD), our framework outperforms random sampling and\nenergy-uncertainty-based sampling. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian MLPs\nachieve competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art models while enabling\nuncertainty-guided active learning, OOD detection, and energy/forces\ncalibration.

Consequently,\nevaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses,\nand only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we\nstudy inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and\nprove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with\n$k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting\nand BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM),\nwith a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high\nfrequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove\nthat when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is\n$O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$\nis the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error\nof the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of\nreward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound,\ncertifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a\nkey advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade\nwhen increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show\nBoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN."}

Understanding the Algorithmic Trade-off in Partially Observable Reinforcement Learning", "comment": "45 pages, 9 figures, published at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Partial observability is a notorious challenge in reinforcement learning\n(RL), due to the need to learn complex, history-dependent policies. Recent\nempirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages\navailability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a\nsimulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to\ndisentangle the task of \"learning to see\" from \"learning to act\". While expert\ndistillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state\ninformation, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through\na simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and\ncontrolled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we\ninvestigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation\nand standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The\ntrade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as\ntheoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief\ncontraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is\nnot always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new\nguidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially\nadvancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially\nobservable domains."}

Previous methods typically address this by\nmaintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern\nmeaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that\nan unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and\ndestabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within\nRLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable\nlow-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning\nsparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are\nsystematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a\ndegeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability\nRegularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a\nheuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out\npresumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining\ncandidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of\n\\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft\nregularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL\ndivergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for\naround 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse.\nThis sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a\n$60.17\\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\\%$\nover prior methods.

Robotic manipulation tasks that require\ncontinuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However,\nmost visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of\nphysical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact\nforces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information\ninto vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts,\nbut could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data\nscarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing\nprocesses are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the\nSim2Real gap.

Specifically, we target\nthe representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple,\ndetector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we\ndefine modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging\nmodality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate\nthe modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context\nAttention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to\npropagate modality context within the query set.

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble\nlearning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade\nand freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A\nnovel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed,\nwith egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert\nassessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and\nHaugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply\nmachine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only\nexternal, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding\nlabeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from\nexternal egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and\nweight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature\nextraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152,\nDenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction,\nSMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning\nalgorithms.
