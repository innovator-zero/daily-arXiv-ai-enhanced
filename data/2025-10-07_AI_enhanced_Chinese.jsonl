This capability is essential\nfor optimizing treatment planning and anticipating disease progression.\nConventional reaction-diffusion models are limited in scope, as they fail to\ncapture tumor dynamics under heterogeneous therapeutic paradigms. There is\nhence a critical need for computational frameworks that can realistically\nsimulate SoC interventions while accounting for inter-patient variability in\ngenomics, demographics, and treatment regimens. We introduce Standard-of-Care\nDigital Twin (SoC-DT), a differentiable framework that unifies\nreaction-diffusion tumor growth models, discrete SoC interventions (surgery,\nchemotherapy, radiotherapy) along with genomic and demographic personalization\nto predict post-treatment tumor structure on imaging. An implicit-explicit\nexponential time-differencing solver, IMEX-SoC, is also proposed, which ensures\nstability, positivity, and scalability in SoC treatment situations. Evaluated\non both synthetic data and real world glioma data, SoC-DT consistently\noutperforms classical PDE baselines and purely data-driven neural models in\npredicting tumor dynamics. By bridging mechanistic interpretability with modern\ndifferentiable solvers, SoC-DT establishes a principled foundation for\npatient-specific digital twins in oncology, enabling biologically consistent\ntumor dynamics estimation.

Global pruning\nachieves strong performance but requires $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ memory, which is\ninfeasible for billion-parameter models. Local pruning reduces GPU memory usage\nto that of a single layer by pruning layers independently, but it neglects\ninter-layer dependencies and often leads to suboptimal performance in\nhigh-sparsity regimes. Unlike unstructured pruning, structured pruning produces\nregular sparsity patterns that align well with GPU kernels and library\noptimizations, making it more hardware-efficient. However, structured pruning\ntypically relies on global pruning, since structured patterns are more prone to\nsevere performance degradation under local optimization. To jointly achieve\nstructured pruning and the memory efficiency of local pruning, we propose a\ndivide-and-conquer strategy that decomposes the global pruning problem into\ncoordinated subproblems across different modules, each of which fits within\nlimited GPU memory.

We formulate\nthe problem as mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and propose two encodings:\na baseline vertex-enumeration method and a scalable duality-based method that\navoids explicit enumeration.

The study is based on the\nanalysis of a data frame containing images labeled by seven different emotional\nstates of people of different ages. Particular attention is paid to the problem\nof class imbalance, in which some emotions significantly prevail over others.\nTo solve the classification problem, a neural network model based on LSTM with\nan attention mechanism focusing on key areas of the face that are informative\nfor emotion recognition is used. As part of the experiments, the model is\ntrained on all possible configurations of subsets of six classes with\nsubsequent error correction for the seventh class, excluded at the training\nstage. The results show that correction is possible for all classes, although\nthe degree of success varies: some classes are better restored, others are\nworse. In addition, on the test sample, when correcting some classes, an\nincrease in key quality metrics for small classes was recorded, which indicates\nthe promise of the proposed approach in solving applied problems related to the\nsearch for rare events, for example, in anti-fraud systems.

While\nHPL incorporates trajectory- and step-level DPO for global and local policy\nstability, its core innovation lies in group-level preference optimization\nguided by a dual-layer curriculum. Our approach first decomposes expert\ntrajectories into semantically coherent action groups and then generates\ncontrasting suboptimal groups to enable preference learning at a fine-grained,\nsub-task level. Then, instead of treating all preference pairs equally, HPL\nintroduces a curriculum scheduler that organizes the learning process from\nsimple to complex. This curriculum is structured along two axes: the group\nlength, representing sub-task complexity, and the sample difficulty, defined by\nthe reward gap between preferred and dispreferred action groups. Experiments on\nthree challenging agent benchmarks show that HPL outperforms existing\nstate-of-the-art methods. Our analyses demonstrate that the hierarchical DPO\nloss effectively integrates preference signals across multiple granularities,\nwhile the dual-layer curriculum is crucial for enabling the agent to solve a\nwide range of tasks, from simple behaviors to complex multi-step sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "HPL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f18\u5316LLM\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7DPO\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6b65\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff08HPL\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7DPO\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHPL\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "HPL\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u635f\u5931\u548c\u53cc\u8bfe\u7a0b\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Time series, as a fundamental modality in\nscientific data, presents unique challenges that are often overlooked in\ncurrent multimodal LLMs, which either encode numerical sequences as text or\nconvert them into images. Such approaches may be insufficient for comprehensive\nscientific time series understanding and generation. Existing unified time\nseries models typically specialise in either forecasting or analysis, and their\neffectiveness on non-periodic, heterogeneous scientific signals remains\nunclear. To address these gaps, we introduce SciTS, a benchmark spanning 12\nscientific domains and 43 tasks, with over 50k+ instances, both univariate and\nmultivariate signals ranging from $10^0$ to $10^7$ in length and up to 10~MHz\nin frequency. We benchmark 17 models, including text-only LLMs, multimodal\nLLMs, and unified time series models, and find that general-purpose LLMs\nexhibit stronger generalisability than specialised time series models, while\nrepresenting time series as text or images limits their performance due to\nexcessively long sequences and loss of numerical precision, respectively. We\nthen introduce TimeOmni, a framework that equips LLMs with the ability to\nunderstand and generate time series while remaining compatible with\ngeneral-purpose LLM training.

Due to the extensive observation space\narising from the large number of drivers and orders, order dispatching, though\nfundamentally a centralized task, is often addressed using Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning (MARL). However, independent MARL methods fail to\ncapture global information and exhibit poor cooperation among workers, while\nCentralized Training Decentralized Execution (CTDE) MARL methods suffer from\nthe curse of dimensionality. To overcome these challenges, we propose\nTriple-BERT, a centralized Single Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method\ndesigned specifically for large-scale order dispatching on ride-sharing\nplatforms. Built on a variant TD3, our approach addresses the vast action space\nthrough an action decomposition strategy that breaks down the joint action\nprobability into individual driver action probabilities. To handle the\nextensive observation space, we introduce a novel BERT-based network, where\nparameter reuse mitigates parameter growth as the number of drivers and orders\nincreases, and the attention mechanism effectively captures the complex\nrelationships among the large pool of driver and orders. We validate our method\nusing a real-world ride-hailing dataset from Manhattan.

Existing methods, whether\nreconstruction-based (restoring normal counterparts) or embedding-based\n(pretrained representations), fundamentally conduct image- or feature-level\nmatching to generate anomaly maps. Nonetheless, matching noise has been largely\noverlooked, limiting their detection ability. Beyond earlier focus on unimodal\nRGB-based UAD, recent advances expand to multimodal scenarios, e.g., RGB--3D\nand RGB--Text, enabled by point cloud sensing and vision--language models.\nDespite shared challenges, these lines remain largely isolated, hindering a\ncomprehensive understanding and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we advocate\nunified UAD for both unimodal and multimodal settings in the matching\nperspective.

We argue that large\nreasoning models lack this meta-awareness property by proving severe\nmisalignment between true rollouts and predicted meta information. We posit\nthat aligning meta-prediction with true rollouts will lead to significant\nperformance gains. To verify this hypothesis, we design a training pipeline\nthat boosts Meta-Awareness via Self-Alignment (MASA), and prove that enhanced\nmeta-awareness directly translates to improved accuracy. Unlike existing\nmeta-cognitive reasoning models, our method does not require external training\nsources but leverages self-generated signals to train meta-awareness. Moreover,\nour method enables efficient training by i) filtering out zero-variance prompts\nthat are either trivial or unsolvable and ii) cutting off lengthy rollouts when\nthey are unlikely to lead to correct answers. The results are inspiring: our\nstrategy yields significant improvements in both accuracy and training\nefficiency on in-domain tasks and shows strong generalization to out-of-domain\nbenchmarks. More specifically, our method can speed up GRPO training by over\n1.28x to reach the same performance, and achieve a 19.3% gain in accuracy on\nAIME25, and a 6.2 % average gain over six mathematics benchmarks.

However, most prior work targets narrow capabilities\n(e.g., side switching, precision, or single-task training), limiting broader\napplicability. We present a model-based framework for non-prehensile tabletop\npushing that uses a single learned model to address multiple tasks without\nretraining. Our approach employs a recurrent GRU-based architecture with\nadditional non-linear layers to capture object-environment dynamics while\nensuring stability. A tailored state-action representation enables the model to\ngeneralize across uncertain dynamics, variable push lengths, and diverse tasks.\nFor control, we integrate the learned dynamics with a sampling-based Model\nPredictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller, which generates adaptive,\ntask-oriented actions. This framework supports side switching, variable-length\npushes, and objectives such as precise positioning, trajectory following, and\nobstacle avoidance. Training is performed in simulation with domain\nrandomization to support sim-to-real transfer. We first evaluate the\narchitecture through ablation studies, showing improved prediction accuracy and\nstable rollouts. We then validate the full system in simulation and real-world\nexperiments using a Franka Panda robot with markerless tracking.

While\nemerging literature suggests that reasoning data is increasingly incorporated\nalso during the mid-training stage-a practice that is relatively more\nproprietary and less openly characterized-the role of such data in pretraining\nremains unclear. In particular, due to the opaqueness of pretraining corpora in\nmost frontier models, the effect of reasoning data introduced at different\nphases of pre- and/or post-training is relatively less reported in the\nscientific literature. This raises several important questions: Is adding\nreasoning data earlier during pretraining any better than introducing it during\npost-training? Could earlier inclusion risk overfitting and harm\ngeneralization, or instead establish durable foundations that later fine-tuning\ncannot recover? We conduct the first systematic study of how reasoning\ndata-varying in scale, diversity, and quality-affects LLM performance when\nintroduced at different stages of training. We find that front-loading\nreasoning data into pretraining is critical (19% avg gain), establishing\nfoundational capabilities that cannot be fully replicated by later-stage SFT,\neven with more data. We uncover an asymmetric principle for optimal data\nallocation: pretraining benefits most from broad diversity in reasoning\npatterns (11% avg gain), while SFT is more sensitive to data quality (15% avg\ngain). We show that high-quality pretraining data has latent effects, activated\nonly after SFT, and that naively scaling SFT data can be detrimental, washing\naway the benefits of early reasoning injection.

These observations raise two key questions: (1)\nWhat causes the modality gap? (2) How does it affect downstream tasks? To\naddress these questions, this paper introduces the first theoretical framework\nfor analyzing the convergent optimal representations of MCL and the modality\nalignment when training is optimized. Specifically, we prove that without any\nconstraint or under the cone constraint, the modality gap converges to zero.\nUnder the subspace constraint (i.e., representations of two modalities fall\ninto two distinct hyperplanes due to dimension collapse), the modality gap\nconverges to the smallest angle between the two hyperplanes. This result\nidentifies \\emph{dimension collapse} as the fundamental origin of the modality\ngap. Furthermore, our theorems demonstrate that paired samples cannot be\nperfectly aligned under the subspace constraint.

While analyzing the\ndecision boundary of large language models (LLMs) has raised increasing\nattention recently, constructing it for mainstream LLMs remains computationally\ninfeasible due to the enormous vocabulary-sequence sizes and the\nauto-regressive nature of LLMs. To address this issue, in this paper we propose\nDecision Potential Surface (DPS), a new notion for analyzing LLM decision\nboundary. DPS is defined on the confidences in distinguishing different\nsampling sequences for each input, which naturally captures the potential of\ndecision boundary. We prove that the zero-height isohypse in DPS is equivalent\nto the decision boundary of an LLM, with enclosed regions representing decision\nregions.

Data-enabled predictive control\n(DeePC) goes further by bypassing modeling altogether, directly learning safe\npolicies from raw input-output data.

To address these limitations,\nwe introduce Synergistic Information Distillation (SID), a novel training\nframework that reframes deep learning as a cascade of local cooperative\nrefinement problems. In SID, a deep network is structured as a pipeline of\nmodules, each imposed with a local objective to refine a probabilistic belief\nabout the ground-truth target. This objective balances fidelity to the target\nwith consistency to the belief from its preceding module. By decoupling the\nbackward dependencies between modules, SID enables parallel training and hence\neliminates update locking and drastically reduces memory requirements.\nMeanwhile, this design preserves the standard feed-forward inference pass,\nmaking SID a versatile drop-in replacement for BP. We provide a theoretical\nfoundation, proving that SID guarantees monotonic performance improvement with\nnetwork depth.

In this work, we introduce SDQ-LLM: Sigma-Delta Quantization for\n1-bit LLMs of any size, a novel framework that enables extremely low-bit\nquantization of LLMs while preserving their linguistic reasoning capabilities.\nA distinctive feature of SDQ-LLM is the continuous adjustability of the\nOver-Sampling Ratio (OSR), enabling dynamic adaptation to memory or VRAM\nconstraints by selecting fractional OSR (e.g. 2.5 times) for an optimal\ntrade-off between model size and accuracy. SDQ-LLM uses upsampling combined\nwith Sigma-Delta Quantizer to binarize or ternarize LLMs weights, encoding\nhigh-precision parameters into 1-bit or 1.58-bit representations, replacing the\nmultiplication operations within linear layers with addition. This approach\nsignificantly enhances inference efficiency under extremely low-bit\nquantization. To further reduce the loss of quantization precision, we\nincorporate Hadamard-based weight smoothing prior to quantization, improving\nthe stability and robustness of the weight representations. Furthermore, to\nfully leverage the continuity of the OSR and reduce precision loss, recognizing\nthe correlation between quantization sensitivity and weight variance, we\npropose a fine-grained, layer- and linear-wise OSR allocation strategy,\nMultiOSR. This strategy distributes OSR both across layers and within each\nlayer, based on weight variance and parameter scale. Finally, extensive\nexperiments on OPT and LLaMA model families demonstrate that SDQ-LLM achieves a\nmore efficient and high-precision performance even under highly aggressive\nlow-OSR settings.

However, the non-stationary nature of\nuser data necessitates frequent retraining, which introduces a fundamental\ntension between inference latency and model accuracy under constrained GPU\nresources. Existing retraining strategies either delay model updates,\nover-commit resources to retraining, or overlook iteration-level retraining\ngranularity. In this paper, we identify that iteration-level scheduling is\ncrucial for adapting retraining frequency to model drift without violating\nservice-level objectives (SLOs). We propose MACE, a hybrid LLM system that\ncolocates concurrent inference (prefill, decode) and fine-tuning, with\nintelligent memory management to maximize task performance while promising\ninference throughput.

However, the performance of existing\nanomaly detection methods heavily relies on labeling, while labeling a large\nvolume of logs is highly challenging. To address this issue, many approaches\nbased on transfer learning and active learning have been proposed.\nNevertheless, their effectiveness is hindered by issues such as the gap between\nsource and target system data distributions and cold-start problems. In this\npaper, we propose LogAction, a novel log-based anomaly detection model based on\nactive domain adaptation. LogAction integrates transfer learning and active\nlearning techniques. On one hand, it uses labeled data from a mature system to\ntrain a base model, mitigating the cold-start issue in active learning. On the\nother hand, LogAction utilize free energy-based sampling and uncertainty-based\nsampling to select logs located at the distribution boundaries for manual\nlabeling, thus addresses the data distribution gap in transfer learning with\nminimal human labeling efforts. Experimental results on six different\ncombinations of datasets demonstrate that LogAction achieves an average 93.01%\nF1 score with only 2% of manual labels, outperforming some state-of-the-art\nmethods by 26.28%.

For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each,\nderive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on\nhardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip\nlimits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an\neight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg\nprovides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke\ndouble rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far\nricher gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we\nused deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored\nspace. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under\nthe right priors and discover novel behaviors as well.

UGround\naddresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its\nreliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies\ncumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate\ncorrection, and (2) its use of \\texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly\nprojects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues\n(\\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which\ncomprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as\nPrompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic\nsampling, allows each \\texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer\nlayers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision\nmodel (\\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion.

Training a\ndiffusion model consists of learning how to denoise noisy samples at different\nnoise levels. When training diffusion models for point clouds such as molecules\nand proteins, there is often no canonical orientation that can be assigned. To\ncapture this symmetry, the true data samples are often augmented by\ntransforming them with random rotations sampled uniformly over $SO(3)$. Then,\nthe denoised predictions are often rotationally aligned via the Kabsch-Umeyama\nalgorithm to the ground truth samples before computing the loss. However, the\neffect of this alignment step has not been well studied. Here, we show that the\noptimal denoiser can be expressed in terms of a matrix Fisher distribution over\n$SO(3)$.

KVComm\nleverages the rich information encoded in the KV pairs while avoiding the\npitfalls of hidden states. We introduce a KV layer-wise selection strategy\nbased on attention importance scores with a Gaussian prior to identify the most\ninformative KV pairs for communication. Extensive experiments across diverse\ntasks and model pairs demonstrate that KVComm achieves comparable performance\nto the upper-bound method, which directly merges inputs to one model without\nany communication, while transmitting as few as 30\\% of layers' KV pairs. Our\nstudy highlights the potential of KV pairs as an effective medium for inter-LLM\ncommunication, paving the way for scalable and efficient multi-agent systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "KVComm\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5171\u4eabKV\u5bf9\u5b9e\u73b0LLM\u95f4\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u901a\u4fe1\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u504f\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cKVComm\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "KVComm\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6570\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u7684KV\u5c42\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684KV\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKVComm\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u76f4\u63a5\u5408\u5e76\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f9330%\u7684KV\u5bf9\u3002", "conclusion": "KV\u5bf9\u4f5c\u4e3aLLM\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u5a92\u4ecb\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u94fa\u5e73\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

A high-precision dynamic digital human avatar can be applied to\nvarious fields such as game production, animation generation, and remote\nimmersive communication.

In light of this fact, quality assessment of dynamic 4D digital humans\nbecomes increasingly important. In this paper, we first propose a large-scale\ndynamic digital human quality assessment dataset, DHQA-4D, which contains 32\nhigh-quality real-scanned 4D human mesh sequences, 1920 distorted textured 4D\nhuman meshes degraded by 11 textured distortions, as well as their\ncorresponding textured and non-textured mean opinion scores (MOSs).

Conventional Vision-Language-Action (VLA)\nmodels, which integrate reasoning and action into a monolithic architecture,\ngeneralize poorly because they are constrained by scarce, narrow-domain data.\nWhile recent dual-system approaches attempt to decouple \"thinking\" from\n\"acting\", they are often constrained by semantic ambiguities within the action\nmodule. This ambiguity makes large-scale, cross-task training infeasible.\nConsequently, these systems typically necessitate fine-tuning on newly\ncollected data when deployed to novel environments, and the cooperation\nmechanism between the two systems remains ill-defined.

Our approach utilizes sparse 3D trajectories as an\nintermediate representation, effectively bridging the high-level planning\ncapabilities of the VLM with the low-level physical action module.

These\nwaypoints are then processed by our generalizable action expert, which refines\nthem into dense, executable action sequences by sampling real-time point cloud\nobservations of the environment. To promote training efficiency and robust\ngeneralization, we introduce a novel \"Action Pre-training, Pointcloud\nFine-tuning\" paradigm.

To achieve this goal, recent methods seek to construct a\nlarge-scale instruction tuning dataset to empower the MLLM with quality\nperception ability following the well-known scaling law. However, a large\namount of instruction tuning data may cause substantial computational costs and\nredundant data, which in turn will cause harm to the performance of the model.\nTo cope with this problem, in this paper, we challenge the scaling law and\nsystematically investigate the role of data quality of the instruction tuning\ndataset for explainable IQA. Using a powerful pre-trained MLLM, we first\ninvestigate the changes in model performance after fine-tuning with different\nsizes of instruction tuning data. We find that selecting a subset of the data\nset randomly using an appropriate ratio can even lead to better results than\ntraining with the entire instruction tuning dataset, demonstrating the\nredundancy of current explainable IQA instruction tuning data.

Once deployed in a closed loop, such policies lack recovery\ndata: small mistakes cannot be corrected and quickly compound into failures. A\npromising direction is to generate alternative viewpoints and trajectories\nbeyond the logged path. Prior work explores photorealistic digital twins via\nneural rendering or game engines, but these methods are prohibitively slow and\ncostly, and thus mainly used for evaluation. In this work, we argue that\nphotorealism is unnecessary for training end-to-end planners. What matters is\nsemantic fidelity and scalability: driving depends on geometry and dynamics,\nnot textures or lighting. Motivated by this, we propose 3D Rasterization, which\nreplaces costly rendering with lightweight rasterization of annotated\nprimitives, enabling augmentations such as counterfactual recovery maneuvers\nand cross-agent view synthesis. To transfer these synthetic views effectively\nto real-world deployment, we introduce a Raster-to-Real feature-space alignment\nthat bridges the sim-to-real gap. Together, these components form Rasterization\nAugmented Planning (RAP), a scalable data augmentation pipeline for planning.\nRAP achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop robustness and long-tail\ngeneralization, ranking first on four major benchmarks: NAVSIM v1/v2, Waymo\nOpen Dataset Vision-based E2E Driving, and Bench2Drive.

Currently, the\nmajority of existing methods utilize a generator to synthesize images to\nsupport the distillation. Although the current methods have achieved great\nsuccess, there are still many issues to be explored. Firstly, the outstanding\nperformance of supervised learning in deep learning drives us to explore a\npseudo-supervised paradigm on DFKD. Secondly, current synthesized methods\ncannot distinguish the distributions of different categories of samples, thus\nproducing ambiguous samples that may lead to an incorrect evaluation by the\nteacher. Besides, current methods cannot optimize the category-wise diversity\nsamples, which will hinder the student model learning from diverse samples and\nfurther achieving better performance. In this paper, to address the above\nlimitations, we propose a novel learning paradigm, i.e., conditional\npseudo-supervised contrast for data-free knowledge distillation~(CPSC-DFKD).\nThe primary innovations of CPSC-DFKD are: (1) introducing a conditional\ngenerative adversarial network to synthesize category-specific diverse images\nfor pseudo-supervised learning, (2) improving the modules of the generator to\ndistinguish the distributions of different categories, and (3) proposing\npseudo-supervised contrastive learning based on teacher and student views to\nenhance diversity. Comprehensive experiments on three commonly-used datasets\nvalidate the performance lift of both the student and generator brought by\nCPSC-DFKD.

We further theoretically prove that this optimization cycle can\nsignificantly reduce the generalization error under some conditions.\nAdditionally, we propose a class-aware adaptive augmentation module to further\nimprove the representation of minority classes, and an auxiliary branch to\nmaximize data utilization by leveraging all labeled and unlabeled samples.\nComprehensive evaluations on various commonly used benchmark datasets show that\nCPG achieves consistent improvements, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by up\nto \\textbf{15.97\\%} in accuracy.

This paper advocates\nfor ensemble learning as a natural solution to this problem, whereby training\nmultiple graph learners under distinct sampling conditions, the ensemble\ninherently captures different aspects of graph heterogeneity. Yet, the crux\nlies in combining these learners to meet global optimization objective while\nmaintaining computational efficiency on large-scale graphs. In response, we\npropose LHGEL, an ensemble framework that addresses these challenges through\nbatch sampling with three key components, namely batch view aggregation,\nresidual attention, and diversity regularization. Specifically, batch view\naggregation samples subgraphs and forms multiple graph views, while residual\nattention adaptively weights the contributions of these views to guide node\nembeddings toward informative subgraphs, thereby improving the accuracy of base\nlearners. Diversity regularization encourages representational disparity across\nembedding matrices derived from different views, promoting model diversity and\nensemble robustness. Our theoretical study demonstrates that residual attention\nmitigates gradient vanishing issues commonly faced in ensemble learning.\nEmpirical results on five real heterogeneous networks validate that our LHGEL\napproach consistently outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors by\nsubstantial margin.

This insight offers a first principles explanation for the historical\ndependence on normalization layers and sheds new light on a family of\nsuccessful normalization-free techniques like SkipInit and Fixup.

However, this binary framework neglects the\ninherent ordinal relationships among the sub-classes contained within each\ncategory (FL and NF). Several studies on solar flare prediction have\nempirically shown that the most frequent misclassifications occur near this\nprediction threshold.

To mitigate this limitation, we propose a modified loss function\nthat integrates the ordinal information among the sub-classes of the binarized\nflare labels into the conventional binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss. This\napproach serves as an ordinality-aware, data-driven regularization method that\npenalizes the incorrect predictions of flare events in close proximity to the\nprediction threshold more heavily than those away from the boundary during\nmodel optimization.

The first challenge arises from the sheer volume of data that needs\nto be processed. Flagging anomalies in a high-throughput environment calls for\na careful consideration of both algorithm and system design. The second\nchallenge comes from the heterogeneity of time-series datasets that leverage\nsuch a system in production. In practice, anomaly detection systems are rarely\ndeployed for a single use case. Typically, there are several metrics to\nmonitor, often across several domains (e.g. engineering, business and\noperations). A one-size-fits-all approach rarely works, so these systems need\nto be fine-tuned for every application - this is often done manually. The third\nchallenge comes from the fact that determining the root-cause of anomalies in\nsuch settings is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. Identifying (in real\ntime) a time-series dataset that is associated causally with the anomalous\ntime-series data is a very difficult problem. In this paper, we describe a\nunified framework that addresses these challenges. Reasoning based Anomaly\nDetection Framework (RADF) is designed to perform real time anomaly detection\non very large datasets. This framework employs a novel technique (mSelect) that\nautomates the process of algorithm selection and hyper-parameter tuning for\neach use case. Finally, it incorporates a post-detection capability that allows\nfor faster triaging and root-cause determination. Our extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that RADF, powered by mSelect, surpasses state-of-the-art anomaly\ndetection models in AUC performance for 5 out of 9 public benchmarking\ndatasets.

Achieving an appropriate balance between enhancing the utility of model\noutputs and mitigating their potential for harm is a complex and persistent\nchallenge. Contemporary approaches frequently formalize this problem within the\nframework of Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) and employ\nestablished CMDP optimization techniques. However, these methods exhibit two\nnotable limitations. First, their reliance on reward and cost functions renders\nperformance highly sensitive to the underlying scoring mechanism, which must\ncapture semantic meaning rather than being triggered by superficial keywords.\nSecond, CMDP-based training entails tuning dual-variable, a process that is\nboth computationally expensive and does not provide any provable safety\nguarantee for a fixed dual variable that can be exploitable through adversarial\njailbreaks. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Certifiable Safe-RLHF\n(CS-RLHF) that introduces a cost model trained on a large-scale corpus to\nassign semantically grounded safety scores. In contrast to the lagrangian-based\napproach, CS-RLHF adopts a rectified penalty-based formulation. This design\ndraws on the theory of exact penalty functions in constrained optimization,\nwherein constraint satisfaction is enforced directly through a suitably chosen\npenalty term. With an appropriately scaled penalty, feasibility of the safety\nconstraints can be guaranteed at the optimizer, eliminating the need for\ndual-variable updates.

To\naddress this, we propose a boundary condition-guaranteed evolutionary\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with radial basis functions (BEKAN). In BEKAN,\nwe propose three distinct and combinable approaches for incorporating\nDirichlet, periodic, and Neumann boundary conditions into the network. For\nDirichlet problem, we use smooth and global Gaussian RBFs to construct\nunivariate basis functions for approximating the solution and to encode\nboundary information at the activation level of the network. To handle periodic\nproblems, we employ a periodic layer constructed from a set of sinusoidal\nfunctions to enforce the boundary conditions exactly. For a Neumann problem, we\ndevise a least-squares formulation to guide the parameter evolution toward\nsatisfying the Neumann condition. By virtue of the boundary-embedded RBFs, the\nperiodic layer, and the evolutionary framework, we can perform accurate PDE\nsimulations while rigorously enforcing boundary conditions.

This\ncapability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this\npaper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a\nvideo generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images\nas the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large\npretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but\nalso the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal\nconsistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that\nexplicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target\nframe is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing\ntrajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable\ntransformations.

Our method makes three key\ncontributions: (1) a learning-based deformable face registration module that\nsemantically aligns generated and restored faces; (2) a texture guided\nrestoration network to dynamically extract and transfer the texture of\ngenerated face to boost the quality of identity-preserving restored face; and\n(3) the integration of deep metric learning for BFR with the generation of\ninformative positive and hard negative samples to better fuse identity-\npreserving and generative features. Extensive experiments on real-world and\nsynthetic datasets demonstrate that, the pro- posed CodeFormer++ achieves\nsuperior performance in terms of both visual fidelity and identity consistency.", "AI": {"tldr": "CodeFormer++ \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6062\u590d\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8eab\u4efd\u5931\u771f\u6216\u9000\u5316\u53bb\u9664\u4e0d\u7406\u60f3\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u578b\u53ef\u53d8\u5f62\u6ce8\u518c\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u5f15\u5bfc\u6062\u590d\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCodeFormer++ \u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "CodeFormer++ \u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f2\u8138\u6062\u590d\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We\nintroduce Token Hidden Reward (THR), a token-level metric that quantifies each\ntoken's influence on the likelihood of correct responses under Group Relative\nPolicy Optimization (GRPO). We find that training dynamics are dominated by a\nsmall subset of tokens with high absolute THR values. Most interestingly,\ntokens with positive THR strengthen confidence in correct outputs, thus\nfavoring exploitation, while tokens with negative THR preserve probability mass\nfor alternative outputs, enabling exploration. This insight suggests a natural\nintervention: a THR-guided reweighting algorithm that modulates GRPO's learning\nsignals to explicitly bias training toward exploitation or exploration. We\nvalidate the efficacy of this algorithm on diverse math reasoning benchmarks.\nBy amplifying tokens with positive THR value and weakening negative ones, our\nalgorithm improves greedy-decoding accuracy, favoring exploitation. The reverse\nstrategy yields consistent gains in Pass@K accuracy, favoring exploration. We\nfurther demonstrate that our algorithm integrates seamlessly with other RL\nobjectives such as GSPO and generalizes across architectures including Llama.\nThese findings establish THR as a principled and fine-grained mechanism for\ndynamically controlling exploration and exploitation in RL-tuned LLMs,\nproviding new tools for targeted fine-tuning in reasoning-intensive\napplications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aToken Hidden Reward (THR)\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u5bf9\u6b63\u786e\u54cd\u5e94\u6982\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7THR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u7b97\u6cd5\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u660e\u786e\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bad\u7ec3\u504f\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u5229\u7528\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165THR\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cdTHR\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u504f\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\u6216\u5229\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u6b63\u5411THR\u589e\u5f3a\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u504f\u5411\u5229\u7528\uff09\uff0c\u53cd\u5411\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347Pass@K\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08\u504f\u5411\u63a2\u7d22\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "THR\u4e3aRL\u8c03\u4f18\u7684LLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u3002"}}

This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all\npixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result,\nduring generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated\nregions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately\nimpairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose\nasynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct\ntimesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising\nprocess. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels,\nprompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions,\nthereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently,\nthese prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can\nsignificantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts.

However,\nmodern representation learning approaches, such as graph contrastive learning\n(GCL) and augmentation methods like Mixup, typically overlook this mixture\nstructure. In this work, we propose a unified framework that explicitly models\ndata as a mixture of underlying probabilistic graph generative models\nrepresented by graphons. To characterize these graphons, we leverage graph\nmoments (motif densities) to cluster graphs arising from the same model. This\nenables us to disentangle the mixture components and identify their distinct\ngenerative mechanisms. This model-aware partitioning benefits two key graph\nlearning tasks: 1) It enables a graphon-mixture-aware mixup (GMAM), a data\naugmentation technique that interpolates in a semantically valid space guided\nby the estimated graphons, instead of assuming a single graphon per class. 2)\nFor GCL, it enables model-adaptive and principled augmentations. Additionally,\nby introducing a new model-aware objective, our proposed approach (termed MGCL)\nimproves negative sampling by restricting negatives to graphs from other\nmodels. We establish a key theoretical guarantee: a novel, tighter bound\nshowing that graphs sampled from graphons with small cut distance will have\nsimilar motif densities with high probability.

We introduce a novel cost model for acquiring additional\nlabeled data, designed to more accurately reflect real-world costs such as\ncredit assessment, loan processing, and potential defaults. Our goal is to find\noptimal fairness audit algorithms that are more cost-effective than random\nexploration and natural baselines.\n  In our work, we consider two audit settings: a black-box model with no\nassumptions on the data distribution, and a mixture model, where features and\ntrue labels follow a mixture of exponential family distributions. In the\nblack-box setting, we propose a near-optimal auditing algorithm under mild\nassumptions and show that a natural baseline can be strictly suboptimal. In the\nmixture model setting, we design a novel algorithm that achieves significantly\nlower audit cost than the black-box case. Our approach leverages prior work on\nlearning from truncated samples and maximum-a-posteriori oracles, and extends\nknown results on spherical Gaussian mixtures to handle exponential family\nmixtures, which may be of independent interest. Moreover, our algorithms apply\nto popular fairness metrics including demographic parity, equal opportunity,\nand equalized odds.

This uniformity is highly advantageous in many problems in\nscience and engineering, including in numerical integration, computer vision,\nmachine perception, computer graphics, machine learning, and simulation.\nWhereas most previous low-discrepancy constructions rely on abstract algebra\nand number theory, Message-Passing Monte Carlo (MPMC) was recently introduced\nto exploit machine learning methods for generating point sets with lower\ndiscrepancy than previously possible. However, MPMC is limited to generating\npoint sets and cannot be extended to low-discrepancy sequences (LDS), i.e.,\nsequences of points in which every prefix has low discrepancy, a property\nessential for many applications. To address this limitation, we introduce\nNeural Low-Discrepancy Sequences ($NeuroLDS$), the first machine learning-based\nframework for generating LDS. Drawing inspiration from classical LDS, we train\na neural network to map indices to points such that the resulting sequences\nexhibit minimal discrepancy across all prefixes.

Existing methods are insufficient:\nmerging-based approaches provide indirect, suboptimal control at the parameter\nlevel, often disregarding the impacts of multiple objectives. While\ndecoding-based guidance is more direct, it typically requires aggregating\nlogits from multiple expert models, incurring significant space overhead and\nrelying heavily on individual model capacity. To address these issues, we\nintroduce Merge-And-GuidE (MAGE), a two-stage framework that leverages model\nmerging for guided decoding. We first identify a critical compatibility problem\nbetween the guidance and base models. In Stage 1, MAGE resolves this by\ndynamically constructing a more robust base model, merging a series of backbone\nmodels that account for multiple objectives.

We replace the clip objective with a novel discrete\ndifferentiable trust region projection, which provides principled token-level\nKL constraints. The projection operates on a sparse subset of the model's most\nimportant token logits to balance computational cost and projection\neffectiveness. Our approach, Trust Region Optimization for Large Language\nModels (TROLL), serves as a direct replacement for PPO-like clipping during\ntraining and does not alter the model's inference behavior. Across datasets,\nmodel families, and advantage-estimation methods, TROLL consistently\noutperforms PPO-like clipping in terms of training speed, stability, and final\nsuccess rates.", "AI": {"tldr": "TROLL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3PPO\u7684clip\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "PPO\u7684clip\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5e38\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u79bb\u6563\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4fe1\u4efb\u533a\u57df\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u5bf9\u91cd\u8981token\u7684logits\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "TROLL\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8ePPO-like clip\u3002", "conclusion": "TROLL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u4ee3PPO clip\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002"}}

We test HOFLON on two industrial case studies: a\npolymerization reactor start-up and a paper-machine grade-change problem, and\nbenchmark it against Implicit Q-Learning (IQL), a leading offline-RL algorithm.\nIn both plants HOFLON not only surpasses IQL but also delivers, on average,\nbetter cumulative rewards than the best start-up or grade-change observed in\nthe historical data, demonstrating its potential to automate transition\noperations beyond current expert capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "HOFLON\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e0a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5de5\u5382\u64cd\u4f5c\u9762\u4e34\u4e13\u5bb6\u9000\u4f11\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6d41\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "HOFLON\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u548c\u957f\u65f6Q\u8bc4\u4ef7\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408Q\u503c\u548c\u6d41\u5f62\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u548c\u9020\u7eb8\u673a\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0cHOFLON\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eIQL\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u6700\u4f73\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "HOFLON\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While\ntraditional methods are limited to fixed semantic categories, recent approaches\nhave moved towards predicting text-aligned features to enable open-vocabulary\ntext queries in real-world scenes. However, there exists a trade-off in\ntext-aligned scene modeling: sparse Gaussian representation struggles to\ncapture small objects in the scene, while dense representation incurs\nsignificant computational overhead. To address these limitations, we present\nPG-Occ, an innovative Progressive Gaussian Transformer Framework that enables\nopen-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction. Our framework employs progressive\nonline densification, a feed-forward strategy that gradually enhances the 3D\nGaussian representation to capture fine-grained scene details. By iteratively\nenhancing the representation, the framework achieves increasingly precise and\ndetailed scene understanding. Another key contribution is the introduction of\nan anisotropy-aware sampling strategy with spatio-temporal fusion, which\nadaptively assigns receptive fields to Gaussians at different scales and\nstages, enabling more effective feature aggregation and richer scene\ninformation capture. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that PG-Occ\nachieves state-of-the-art performance with a relative 14.3% mIoU improvement\nover the previous best performing method.

The challenge evaluated two tasks:\ngeneralization to an unseen center and center-specific adaptation after\nfine-tuning. Submitted approaches included foundation models with linear\nprobing, metric learning with triplet loss, and various FL aggregation schemes\n(FedAvg, FedMedian, FedSAM). Performance was assessed using F1-score and\nExpected Cost, with ranking robustness evaluated via bootstrapping and\nstatistical testing.

The challenge highlighted\nlimitations in generalization, sensitivity to class imbalance, and difficulties\nin hyperparameter tuning in decentralized training, while spatiotemporal\nmodeling and context-aware preprocessing emerged as promising strategies.\nConclusion: The FedSurg Challenge establishes the first benchmark for\nevaluating FL strategies in surgical video classification. Findings highlight\nthe trade-off between local personalization and global robustness, and\nunderscore the importance of architecture choice, preprocessing, and loss\ndesign.

Previously, we devised an \"enriched\" chart review protocol where a\n\"roadmap\" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values\nin EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a\nmissing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart\nreviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients\nwhose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of\na roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification\nof Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing\nvalues. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap\nfrom our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined\nusing large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to\nexpand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients\nfrom the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm\nperformance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients,\nwe applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved\nadditions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more,\nmissing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap.\nDiscussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing\nEHR data with similar accuracy to chart reviews and can feasibly be applied to\nlarge samples.

Robust optimization (RO) offers a\nprincipled approach by safeguarding against worst-case scenarios across a range\nof uncertain parameters. However, traditional RO methods typically require\nknown problem structure, which limits their applicability to high-fidelity\nsimulation environments. To overcome these limitations, recent work has\nexplored robust Bayesian optimization (RBO) as a flexible alternative that can\naccommodate expensive, black-box objectives. Existing RBO methods, however,\ngenerally ignore available structural information and struggle to scale to\nhigh-dimensional settings. In this work, we introduce BONSAI (Bayesian\nOptimization of Network Systems under uncertAInty), a new RBO framework that\nleverages partial structural knowledge commonly available in simulation-based\nmodels. Instead of treating the objective as a monolithic black box, BONSAI\nrepresents it as a directed graph of interconnected white- and black-box\ncomponents, allowing the algorithm to utilize intermediate information within\nthe optimization process.

We first study the\nflow of visual information through the language model, finding that image value\ntokens encode sufficient information to perform several perception-heavy tasks\nzero-shot: segmentation, semantic correspondence, temporal correspondence, and\nreferring expression detection. We find that while the language model does\naugment the visual information received from the projection of input visual\nencodings-which we reveal correlates with overall MLM perception capability-it\ncontains less visual information on several tasks than the equivalent visual\nencoder (SigLIP) that has not undergone MLM finetuning. Further, we find that\nthe visual information corresponding to input-agnostic image key tokens in\nlater layers of language models contains artifacts which reduce perception\ncapability of the overall MLM. Next, we discuss controlling visual information\nin the language model, showing that adding a text prefix to the image input\nimproves perception capabilities of visual representations. Finally, we reveal\nthat if language models were able to better control their visual information,\ntheir perception would significantly improve; e.g., in 33.3% of Art Style\nquestions in the BLINK benchmark, perception information present in the\nlanguage model is not surfaced to the output!

Therefore, a\nmultitude of compression techniques have been developed to reduce these costs\nwhile maintaining accuracy. In addition, dynamic architectures have been\nintroduced to modulate the level of compression at execution time, which is a\ndesirable property in many resource-limited application scenarios. The proposed\nmethod effectively integrates two well-established optimization techniques:\nearly exits and knowledge distillation, where a reduced student early-exit\nmodel is trained from a more complex teacher early-exit model. The primary\ncontribution of this research lies in the approach for training the student\nearly-exit model.

To address this challenge, we propose category-wise\ninfluence functions and introduce an influence vector that quantifies the\nimpact of each training sample across all categories.

We use the\npublicly released EAGLE-I outage dataset (2014-2022), maintained by Oak Ridge\nNational Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy. The pipeline preserves\nconvective micro-signals from a sparse station network via parameter-specific\nkriging with hourly variograms and targeted overdrafting to retain extremes,\nand builds causal spatio-temporal features (lags/rolling statistics; k-NN/IDW\nspatial aggregates) capturing precursors of severe convection (moisture\nadvection, wind shifts, and pressure drops). The two-stage model design,\ncombining a logistic gate and an LSTM regressor, limits routine periods and\nreduces noise exposure. The study uses event-centric metrics (cluster-based\nhits/misses/false alarms) and peak-conditional MASE (cMASE) in +/-Delta-hour\nwindows around state-level peaks (>= 50,000), with uncertainty quantified by\nhourly moving-block bootstrap.\n  On the test sample, Two-Stage detects more reference peaks across all windows\n(e.g., at +/-48 h it records 3/4 vs. 2/4; F1 66.7% vs. 57.1%) with one extra\nfalse alarm.

However, these hierarchies\nare frequently overlooked, and most approaches focus only on fine-grained\nclassification schemes. In this paper, we present a novel Semantics-Aware\nHierarchical Consensus (SAHC) method for learning hierarchical features and\nrelationships by integrating hierarchy-specific classification heads within a\ndeep network architecture, each specialized in different degrees of class\ngranularity. The proposed approach employs trainable hierarchy matrices, which\nguide the network through the learning of the hierarchical structure in a\nself-supervised manner. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical consensus\nmechanism to ensure consistent probability distributions across different\nhierarchical levels. This mechanism acts as a weighted ensemble being able to\neffectively leverage the inherent structure of the hierarchical classification\ntask. The proposed SAHC method is evaluated on three benchmark datasets with\ndifferent degrees of hierarchical complexity on different tasks, using distinct\nbackbone architectures to effectively emphasize its adaptability.

This\napproach is practical and efficient: it leverages the ease of generating\nabundant reasoning data from stronger models and provides a direct, data-driven\nway to teach less capable models better reasoning. While previous work has\nlargely focused on prompt selection with responses from a single teacher, the\nequally important problem of choosing the best response when multiple teacher\noutputs are available for a single prompt remains underexplored. This challenge\nbecomes important in a multi-teacher setting, where different students may\nbenefit from the outputs of different teachers. This paper fills that gap with\na systematic study of response selection for reasoning distillation. We first\nshow that the current method, which picks responses the student assigns the\nhighest global log-probability (global naturalness), fails when responses come\nfrom multiple teachers, i.e., global naturalness no longer correlates with\ndownstream performance, especially as the reasoning traces from strong teachers\nbecome longer.

The recent emergence of\nVideo-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders\nwith powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable\ncapabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that\ntransforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated\nreasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature.\nThis survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training\nmethodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars:\nsupervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL)\nfrom verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced\ninference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the\nroles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques,\naddressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal\ngrounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through\nsystematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design\nprinciples, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open\nchallenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization.

A Two-Stage Dynamic View", "comment": null, "summary": "The ongoing debate on whether reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards\n(RLVR) expands or shrinks the reasoning capabilities of large language models\n(LLMs) remains unresolved. Some studies contend that RLVR mainly improves\nsampling efficiency but at the expense of diversity and exploratory capacity,\nresulting in capability boundary shrinkage. In contrast, others demonstrate\nthat prolonged training can lead to the emergence of novel reasoning\nstrategies, suggesting capability boundary expansion. To reconcile these\ncontradictory findings, we theoretically and empirically show that both\nperspectives are partially valid-each aligning with a separate phase in an\ninherent two-stage probability mass dynamic: (1) Exploitation stage: initially,\nthe model primarily samples explored high-reward and low-reward tokens, while\nrarely selecting the potentially optimal token. Positive advantage estimates\nincrease the probability of high-reward tokens and decrease those of low-reward\ntokens, yet the optimal token's probability remains largely unchanged during\nthis stage. (2) Exploration stage: as training advances, the growth rate of\npreviously acquired high-reward tokens slows as their probabilities approach\nsaturation. When a potentially optimal token-now receiving positive advantage\nestimates-is occasionally sampled, its probability increases, while those of\nthe originally high-reward tokens decrease. This dynamic suggests that\nover-exploitation during the exploitation stage may lead to capability boundary\nshrinkage, whereas prolonged training into the exploration stage can promote an\nexpansion of the reasoning capability boundary.

To tackle this\nproblem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training\ndata points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative\nmodels. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained\nsettings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal\nobjective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can\nprevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a\npre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed\nmethod, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally\nefficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data\ncontaining undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational\ninference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting\nof two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer.

It shows that cross-entropy loss\ndecreases in a predictable power-law rate as the model size increases. However,\nrecent evidence indicates that this law breaks down at very large scales: the\nloss decreases more slowly than expected, which causes significant trouble for\ndeveloping large language models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the root\ncause lies in the fact that cross-entropy itself does not truly scale; instead,\nonly one of its hidden components does. To investigate this, we introduce a\nnovel decomposition of cross-entropy into three parts: Error-Entropy,\nSelf-Alignment, and Confidence. We show both theoretically and empirically that\nthis decomposition precisely captures the training dynamics and optimization\nobjectives. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and 32 models\nspanning five orders of magnitude in size, we find that only error-entropy\nfollows a robust power-law scaling, while the other two terms remain largely\ninvariant. Moreover, error-entropy constitutes the dominant share of\ncross-entropy in small models but diminishes in proportion as models grow\nlarger. This explains why the cross-entropy scaling law appears accurate at\nsmall scales but fails at very large ones.

To bridge these strengths, we introduce VChain,\na novel inference-time chain-of-visual-thought framework that injects visual\nreasoning signals from multimodal models into video generation. Specifically,\nVChain contains a dedicated pipeline that leverages large multimodal models to\ngenerate a sparse set of critical keyframes as snapshots, which are then used\nto guide the sparse inference-time tuning of a pre-trained video generator only\nat these key moments. Our approach is tuning-efficient, introduces minimal\noverhead and avoids dense supervision. Extensive experiments on complex,\nmulti-step scenarios show that VChain significantly enhances the quality of\ngenerated videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "VChain\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8fde\u8d2f\u56e0\u679c\u94fe\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u5907\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0cVChain\u65e8\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u5173\u952e\u5e27\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u5728\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u7a00\u758f\u8c03\u4f18\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bc6\u96c6\u76d1\u7763\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVChain\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "VChain\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u8c03\u4f18\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Empirical results on diverse real-world benchmarks, including human\nmotion capture, molecular dynamics, and large-scale protein simulations, show\nthat PAINET consistently outperforms recently proposed models, yielding 4.7% to\n41.5% error reductions in 3D dynamics prediction with comparable computation\ncosts in terms of time and memory.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAINET\u662f\u4e00\u79cdSE(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "PAINET\u5305\u542b\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPAINET\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e4.7%\u81f341.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "PAINET\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u672a\u89c2\u6d4b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Although not strictly correct in the\nFCI sense, it scales better and often achieves superior accuracy in practice.\nSimulations and real-data analyses demonstrate that BOSS-FCI and GRaSP-FCI\nprovide sound baselines, FCIT improves both efficiency and reliability, and\nLV-Dumb offers a practical heuristic with strong empirical performance.\nTogether, these method highlight the value of score-guided and targeted\nstrategies for scalable latent-variable causal discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86FCI\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "FCI\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u6216\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u5dee\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u865a\u5047\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u58f0\u660e\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8fb9\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86BOSS-FCI\u3001GRaSP-FCI\u3001FCIT\u548cLV-Dumb\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Modern machine learning approaches often falter due to two\nopposing pitfalls: over-specializing on a single, well-known chaotic system\n(e.g., Lorenz-63), which limits generalizability, or indiscriminately mixing\nvast, unrelated time-series, which prevents the model from learning the nuances\nof any specific dynamical regime. We propose Curriculum Chaos Forecasting\n(CCF), a training paradigm that bridges this gap. CCF organizes training data\nbased on fundamental principles of dynamical systems theory, creating a\ncurriculum that progresses from simple, periodic behaviors to highly complex,\nchaotic dynamics. We quantify complexity using the largest Lyapunov exponent\nand attractor dimension, two well-established metrics of chaos. By first\ntraining a sequence model on predictable systems and gradually introducing more\nchaotic trajectories, CCF enables the model to build a robust and generalizable\nrepresentation of dynamical behaviors. We curate a library of over 50 synthetic\nODE/PDE systems to build this curriculum.

LLM unlearning, which aims to remove the influence of\nspecific data while preserving overall model utility, is becoming an important\nresearch area. One of the mainstream unlearning classes is optimization-based\nmethods, which achieve forgetting directly through fine-tuning, exemplified by\nNegative Preference Optimization (NPO). However, NPO's effectiveness is limited\nby its inherent lack of explicit positive preference signals. Attempts to\nintroduce such signals by constructing preferred responses often necessitate\ndomain-specific knowledge or well-designed prompts, fundamentally restricting\ntheir generalizability.

These\nsystems utilize user interaction logs, which consist of exposures, clicks, and\nconversions. CVR prediction models are typically trained solely based on\nclicked samples, as conversions can only be determined following clicks.\nHowever, the sparsity of clicked instances necessitates the collection of a\nsubstantial amount of logs for effective model training. Recent works address\nthis issue by devising frameworks that leverage non-clicked samples. While\nthese frameworks aim to reduce biases caused by the discrepancy between clicked\nand non-clicked samples, they often rely on heuristics. Against this\nbackground, we propose a method to counterfactually generate conversion labels\nfor non-clicked samples by using causality as a guiding principle, attempting\nto answer the question, \"Would the user have converted if he or she had clicked\nthe recommended item?\" Our approach is named the Entire Space Counterfactual\nInference Multi-task Model (ESCIM).

A key challenge is generating\nCEs that are robust against various perturbation types (e.g. input and model\nperturbations) while simultaneously satisfying other desirable properties.\nThese include plausibility, ensuring CEs reside on the data manifold, and\ndiversity, providing multiple distinct recourse options for single inputs.\nExisting methods, however, mostly struggle to address these multifaceted\nrequirements in a unified, model-agnostic manner. We address these limitations\nby proposing a novel generative framework. First, we introduce the\nLabel-conditional Gaussian Mixture Variational Autoencoder (L-GMVAE), a model\ntrained to learn a structured latent space where each class label is\nrepresented by a set of Gaussian components with diverse, prototypical\ncentroids. Building on this, we present LAPACE (LAtent PAth Counterfactual\nExplanations), a model-agnostic algorithm that synthesises entire paths of CE\npoints by interpolating from inputs' latent representations to those learned\nlatent centroids.

To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic\nevaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on\ntwo data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the\nfull set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our\nframework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis\nand a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii)\ndomain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a\ngeneral-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral,\nDeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT).

Existing models typically\noptimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical\nvalues (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates,\nthese models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor\nimputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global\ninformation) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization\ndilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit\nlocal noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this\nissue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck\n(Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework\nby introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual\ninformation approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of\nmasked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps\nthe model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise\ncaused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high\nmissingness.

When parameters in the constraints of a COP are\npredicted, the predicted parameters can lead to infeasible solutions.\nTherefore, it is important to simultaneously manage both feasibility and\ndecision quality. We develop a DFL framework for predicting constraint\nparameters in a generic COP. While prior works typically assume that the\nunderlying optimization problem is a linear program (LP) or integer linear\nprogram (ILP), our approach makes no such assumption.

Inspired by\nthis insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for\nonline RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort\nto the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike\nconventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation\nand sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically\nstops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected.

Existing approaches build model families by training each\nsize independently, which is prohibitively expensive and provides only\ncoarse-grained size options. In this work, we identify a novel phenomenon that\nwe call boomerang distillation: starting from a large base model (the teacher),\none first distills down to a small student and then progressively reconstructs\nintermediate-sized models by re-incorporating blocks of teacher layers into the\nstudent without any additional training. This process produces zero-shot\ninterpolated models of many intermediate sizes whose performance scales\nsmoothly between the student and teacher, often matching or surpassing\npretrained or distilled models of the same size.

Yet aligning LRMs with human preferences, a crucial prerequisite for\nmodel deployment, remains underexplored. The statistically correct objective\nfor preference alignment requires marginalizing over reasoning traces, but this\ncomputation is intractable in practice.

To address this challenge, we frame preference\noptimization for LRMs through the lens of the bias--variance trade-off and\npropose Bias--Variance Optimized Preference Optimization (BVPO), a simple,\ndrop-in method that mixes two gradient estimators: a high-variance trace-based\nestimator and a low-variance empty-trace estimator obtained by disabling\nreasoning trace generation.
