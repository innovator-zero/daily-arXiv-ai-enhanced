### [1] [Attention-Enhanced Prototypical Learning for Few-Shot Infrastructure Defect Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05266)
*Christina Thrainer,Md Meftahul Ferdaus,Mahdi Abdelguerfi,Christian Guetl,Steven Sloan,Kendall N. Niles,Ken Pathak*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种增强特征金字塔网络（E-FPN）框架，用于少样本语义分割，特别适用于基础设施检查中的缺陷分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习框架需要大量标注数据和难以用少量数据学习新缺陷类别的问题。

Method: 采用自适应E-FPN编码器、原型学习和基于注意力的特征表示。

Result: 在8-way 5-shot训练配置下，F1-score为82.55%，mIoU为72.26%。自注意力方法带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够快速响应基础设施检查系统中的新缺陷类型，提高维护效率和经济性。

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation is vital for deep learning-based
infrastructure inspection applications, where labeled training examples are
scarce and expensive. Although existing deep learning frameworks perform well,
the need for extensive labeled datasets and the inability to learn new defect
categories with little data are problematic. We present our Enhanced Feature
Pyramid Network (E-FPN) framework for few-shot semantic segmentation of culvert
and sewer defect categories using a prototypical learning framework. Our
approach has three main contributions: (1) adaptive E-FPN encoder using
InceptionSepConv blocks and depth-wise separable convolutions for efficient
multi-scale feature extraction; (2) prototypical learning with masked average
pooling for powerful prototype generation from small support examples; and (3)
attention-based feature representation through global self-attention, local
self-attention and cross-attention. Comprehensive experimentation on
challenging infrastructure inspection datasets illustrates that the method
achieves excellent few-shot performance, with the best configuration being
8-way 5-shot training configuration at 82.55% F1-score and 72.26% mIoU in 2-way
classification testing. The self-attention method had the most significant
performance improvements, providing 2.57% F1-score and 2.9% mIoU gain over
baselines. Our framework addresses the critical need to rapidly respond to new
defect types in infrastructure inspection systems with limited new training
data that lead to more efficient and economical maintenance plans for critical
infrastructure systems.

### [2] [SkinMap: Weighted Full-Body Skin Segmentation for Robust Remote Photoplethysmography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05296)
*Zahra Maleki,Amirhossein Akbari,Amirhossein Binesh,Babak Khalaj*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型皮肤分割技术，用于提升远程光电容积描记术（rPPG）的信号质量，适用于复杂场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: rPPG技术对光照和运动敏感，现有方法在皮肤区域选择和信号提取上存在不足。

Method: 提出了一种优先选择皮肤区域的分割技术，排除干扰区域（如嘴、眼、头发），并验证了新数据集SYNC-rPPG。

Result: 模型在挑战性条件下（如说话和头部旋转）表现优异，MAE低于其他方法，且对不同肤色具有高准确性。

Conclusion: 该技术为rPPG的实际应用提供了可靠解决方案，尤其在复杂环境和多样化肤色中表现突出。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) is an innovative method for monitoring
heart rate and vital signs by using a simple camera to record a person, as long
as any part of their skin is visible. This low-cost, contactless approach helps
in remote patient monitoring, emotion analysis, smart vehicle utilization, and
more. Over the years, various techniques have been proposed to improve the
accuracy of this technology, especially given its sensitivity to lighting and
movement. In the unsupervised pipeline, it is necessary to first select skin
regions from the video to extract the rPPG signal from the skin color changes.
We introduce a novel skin segmentation technique that prioritizes skin regions
to enhance the quality of the extracted signal. It can detect areas of skin all
over the body, making it more resistant to movement, while removing areas such
as the mouth, eyes, and hair that may cause interference. Our model is
evaluated on publicly available datasets, and we also present a new dataset,
called SYNC-rPPG, to better represent real-world conditions. The results
indicate that our model demonstrates a prior ability to capture heartbeats in
challenging conditions, such as talking and head rotation, and maintain the
mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted and actual heart rates, while other
methods fail to do so. In addition, we demonstrate high accuracy in detecting a
diverse range of skin tones, making this technique a promising option for
real-world applications.

### [3] [DeepAf: One-Shot Spatiospectral Auto-Focus Model for Digital Pathology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05315)
*Yousef Yeganeh,Maximilian Frantzen,Michael Lee,Kun-Hsing Yu,Nassir Navab,Azade Farshad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种低成本、高效的自动显微镜系统DeepAf，通过单次拍摄预测焦点，显著提升了数字病理学的可及性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高成本的WSI扫描仪限制了数字病理学的普及，现有低成本方案存在聚焦不一致、耗时或泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 采用DeepAf框架，结合空间和光谱特征的混合架构，单次预测焦点并自动调整参数。

Result: 系统将聚焦时间减少80%，焦点精度达0.18μm，在低倍镜下癌症分类AUC达0.90。

Conclusion: DeepAf系统为资源有限环境提供了高效、准确的数字病理解决方案。

Abstract: While Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) scanners remain the gold standard for
digitizing pathology samples, their high cost limits accessibility in many
healthcare settings. Other low-cost solutions also face critical limitations:
automated microscopes struggle with consistent focus across varying tissue
morphology, traditional auto-focus methods require time-consuming focal stacks,
and existing deep-learning approaches either need multiple input images or lack
generalization capability across tissue types and staining protocols. We
introduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel
auto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features
through a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed
network automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using
the extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for
optimal image outcomes. Our system transforms conventional microscopes into
efficient slide scanners, reducing focusing time by 80% compared to stack-based
methods while achieving focus accuracy of 0.18 {\mu}m on the same-lab samples,
matching the performance of dual-image methods (0.19 {\mu}m) with half the
input requirements. DeepAf demonstrates robust cross-lab generalization with
only 0.72% false focus predictions and 90% of predictions within the depth of
field. Through an extensive clinical study of 536 brain tissue samples, our
system achieves 0.90 AUC in cancer classification at 4x magnification, a
significant achievement at lower magnification than typical 20x WSI scans. This
results in a comprehensive hardware-software design enabling accessible,
real-time digital pathology in resource-constrained settings while maintaining
diagnostic accuracy.

### [5] [Mitigating Diffusion Model Hallucinations with Dynamic Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05356)
*Kostas Triaridis,Alexandros Graikos,Aggelina Chatziagapi,Grigorios G. Chrysos,Dimitris Samaras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出Dynamic Guidance方法，通过选择性锐化分数函数减少扩散模型中的幻觉样本，同时保留有效的语义变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型生成的样本存在结构不一致的幻觉问题，传统方法通过后处理过滤解决，但缺乏对生成时的直接干预。

Method: 引入Dynamic Guidance，在已知导致伪影的方向上选择性锐化分数函数，避免过度平滑。

Result: 在控制和自然图像数据集上显著减少幻觉，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Dynamic Guidance是首个在生成时而非后处理阶段解决幻觉问题的方法，效果显著。

Abstract: Diffusion models, despite their impressive demos, often produce hallucinatory
samples with structural inconsistencies that lie outside of the support of the
true data distribution. Such hallucinations can be attributed to excessive
smoothing between modes of the data distribution. However, semantic
interpolations are often desirable and can lead to generation diversity, thus
we believe a more nuanced solution is required. In this work, we introduce
Dynamic Guidance, which tackles this issue. Dynamic Guidance mitigates
hallucinations by selectively sharpening the score function only along the
pre-determined directions known to cause artifacts, while preserving valid
semantic variations. To our knowledge, this is the first approach that
addresses hallucinations at generation time rather than through post-hoc
filtering. Dynamic Guidance substantially reduces hallucinations on both
controlled and natural image datasets, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [6] [LightCache: Memory-Efficient, Training-Free Acceleration for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05367)
*Yang Xiao,Gen Li,Kaiyuan Deng,Yushu Wu,Zheng Zhan,Yanzhi Wang,Xiaolong Ma,Bo Hui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于缓存的无训练加速方法，用于视频生成的扩散模型，通过阶段特定策略减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型推理中潜在变量的冗余为加速提供了切入点，但现有缓存方法在后两个阶段会导致内存激增。

Method: 分阶段设计策略：1) 异步缓存交换；2) 特征分块；3) 切片解码。

Result: 相比基线，实现了更快的推理速度和更低的内存占用，质量下降在可接受范围内。

Conclusion: 通过阶段优化策略，平衡了加速与内存消耗，代码已开源。

Abstract: Training-free acceleration has emerged as an advanced research area in video
generation based on diffusion models. The redundancy of latents in diffusion
model inference provides a natural entry point for acceleration. In this paper,
we decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding
stages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to
substantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we
analyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose
stage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous
Cache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode. At the same
time, we ensure that the time overhead introduced by these three strategies
remains lower than the acceleration gains themselves. Compared with the
baseline, our approach achieves faster inference speed and lower memory usage,
while maintaining quality degradation within an acceptable range. The Code is
available at https://github.com/NKUShaw/LightCache .

### [7] [See the past: Time-Reversed Scene Reconstruction from Thermal Traces Using Visual Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05408)
*Kebin Contreras,Luis Toscano-Palomino,Mauro Dalla Mura,Jorge Bacca*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于RGB和热成像配对图像的时间反转重建框架，利用视觉语言模型和约束扩散过程恢复过去几秒的场景状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像可以捕捉人类活动留下的热痕迹，这些痕迹可以作为被动时间码，用于推断近期事件，而RGB相机无法做到这一点。

Method: 结合视觉语言模型（VLMs）和约束扩散过程，一个VLM生成场景描述，另一个指导图像重建，确保语义和结构一致性。

Result: 在三种受控场景中评估，能够重建120秒前的合理过去帧。

Conclusion: 这是从热痕迹进行时间反转成像的第一步，展示了其可行性。

Abstract: Recovering the past from present observations is an intriguing challenge with
potential applications in forensics and scene analysis. Thermal imaging,
operating in the infrared range, provides access to otherwise invisible
information. Since humans are typically warmer (37 C -98.6 F) than their
surroundings, interactions such as sitting, touching, or leaning leave residual
heat traces. These fading imprints serve as passive temporal codes, allowing
for the inference of recent events that exceed the capabilities of RGB cameras.
This work proposes a time-reversed reconstruction framework that uses paired
RGB and thermal images to recover scene states from a few seconds earlier. The
proposed approach couples Visual-Language Models (VLMs) with a constrained
diffusion process, where one VLM generates scene descriptions and another
guides image reconstruction, ensuring semantic and structural consistency. The
method is evaluated in three controlled scenarios, demonstrating the
feasibility of reconstructing plausible past frames up to 120 seconds earlier,
providing a first step toward time-reversed imaging from thermal traces.

### [8] [Personalizing Retrieval using Joint Embeddings or "the Return of Fluffy"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05411)
*Bruno Korbar,Andrew Zisserman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图像实例信息和自然语言描述的图像检索方法，通过映射网络将图像嵌入转换为文本标记，提升个性化检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决结合图像实例和自然语言描述的复合查询问题，例如检索特定对象（如独角兽）在特定场景（如某人头上）的图像。

Method: 设计了一个映射网络（pi-map），将局部图像嵌入转换为文本标记，与自然语言查询结合后用于CLIP风格的文本编码和图像检索。

Result: 在个性化检索基准测试中，该方法优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 通过可训练的映射网络和冻结的CLIP编码器，实现了更高效的复合查询图像检索。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to be able to retrieve images using a compound
query that combines object instance information from an image, with a natural
text description of what that object is doing or where it is. For example, to
retrieve an image of "Fluffy the unicorn (specified by an image) on someone's
head". To achieve this we design a mapping network that can "translate" from a
local image embedding (of the object instance) to a text token, such that the
combination of the token and a natural language query is suitable for CLIP
style text encoding, and image retrieval. Generating a text token in this
manner involves a simple training procedure, that only needs to be performed
once for each object instance. We show that our approach of using a trainable
mapping network, termed pi-map, together with frozen CLIP text and image
encoders, improves the state of the art on two benchmarks designed to assess
personalized retrieval.

### [9] [ArchitectHead: Continuous Level of Detail Control for 3D Gaussian Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05488)
*Peizhi Yan,Rabab Ward,Qiang Tang,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ArchitectHead框架首次实现了3D高斯头像的连续细节控制，通过动态调整高斯点数量平衡渲染效率与视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS头像固定高斯点数量，无法灵活调整细节级别（LOD），限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出UV特征场和多级特征图参数化高斯点，轻量解码器生成3D高斯属性，动态重采样控制LOD。

Result: 最高LOD下达到SOTA质量，最低LOD仅用6.2%高斯点，渲染速度翻倍，质量下降可控。

Conclusion: ArchitectHead实现了无需重新训练的连续LOD控制，为3D头像渲染提供了高效灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled photorealistic and real-time
rendering of 3D head avatars. Existing 3DGS-based avatars typically rely on
tens of thousands of 3D Gaussian points (Gaussians), with the number of
Gaussians fixed after training. However, many practical applications require
adjustable levels of detail (LOD) to balance rendering efficiency and visual
quality. In this work, we propose "ArchitectHead", the first framework for
creating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD. Our
key idea is to parameterize the Gaussians in a 2D UV feature space and propose
a UV feature field composed of multi-level learnable feature maps to encode
their latent features. A lightweight neural network-based decoder then
transforms these latent features into 3D Gaussian attributes for rendering.
ArchitectHead controls the number of Gaussians by dynamically resampling
feature maps from the UV feature field at the desired resolutions. This method
enables efficient and continuous control of LOD without retraining.
Experimental results show that ArchitectHead achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
quality in self and cross-identity reenactment tasks at the highest LOD, while
maintaining near SOTA performance at lower LODs. At the lowest LOD, our method
uses only 6.2\% of the Gaussians while the quality degrades moderately (L1 Loss
+7.9\%, PSNR --0.97\%, SSIM --0.6\%, LPIPS Loss +24.1\%), and the rendering
speed nearly doubles.

### [10] [Human Action Recognition from Point Clouds over Time](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05506)
*James Dickens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D点云的动作识别新方法，结合点云分割、跟踪和体素映射技术，在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动作识别方法主要基于骨骼或视频数据，而3D点云数据未被充分利用。本文旨在利用深度传感器和单目深度估计的点云数据，开发更高效的动作识别框架。

Method: 提出了一种新流程：分割人体点云、跟踪个体、进行身体部位分割，并设计了一种结合点技术和稀疏卷积网络的主干网络。

Result: 在NTU RGB-D 120数据集上表现优于现有点云动作识别方法，准确率达89.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D点云动作识别提供了新思路，尤其在多传感器数据融合方面表现突出。

Abstract: Recent research into human action recognition (HAR) has focused predominantly
on skeletal action recognition and video-based methods. With the increasing
availability of consumer-grade depth sensors and Lidar instruments, there is a
growing opportunity to leverage dense 3D data for action recognition, to
develop a third way. This paper presents a novel approach for recognizing
actions from 3D videos by introducing a pipeline that segments human point
clouds from the background of a scene, tracks individuals over time, and
performs body part segmentation. The method supports point clouds from both
depth sensors and monocular depth estimation. At the core of the proposed HAR
framework is a novel backbone for 3D action recognition, which combines
point-based techniques with sparse convolutional networks applied to
voxel-mapped point cloud sequences. Experiments incorporate auxiliary point
features including surface normals, color, infrared intensity, and body part
parsing labels, to enhance recognition accuracy. Evaluation on the NTU RGB- D
120 dataset demonstrates that the method is competitive with existing skeletal
action recognition algorithms. Moreover, combining both sensor-based and
estimated depth inputs in an ensemble setup, this approach achieves 89.3%
accuracy when different human subjects are considered for training and testing,
outperforming previous point cloud action recognition methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的黎曼度量方法，用于扩散模型的噪声空间，以更好地捕捉数据流形，从而生成更自然的图像插值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型缺乏显式的低维潜在空间，限制了数据流形的分析和操作，如插值和编辑。现有方法在高密度区域插值，可能导致不自然的过渡。

Method: 提出了一种基于分数函数雅可比矩阵的黎曼度量方法，鼓励噪声空间中的测地线保持或平行于学习到的数据流形。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在图像插值中生成的过渡比现有基于密度和朴素基线方法更自然和忠实。

Conclusion: 通过黎曼度量方法，可以更好地利用扩散模型学习到的数据流形，提升插值效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models are powerful deep generative models (DGMs) that generate
high-fidelity, diverse content. However, unlike classical DGMs, they lack an
explicit, tractable low-dimensional latent space that parameterizes the data
manifold. This absence limits manifold-aware analysis and operations, such as
interpolation and editing. Existing interpolation methods for diffusion models
typically follow paths through high-density regions, which are not necessarily
aligned with the data manifold and can yield perceptually unnatural
transitions. To exploit the data manifold learned by diffusion models, we
propose a novel Riemannian metric on the noise space, inspired by recent
findings that the Jacobian of the score function captures the tangent spaces to
the local data manifold. This metric encourages geodesics in the noise space to
stay within or run parallel to the learned data manifold. Experiments on image
interpolation show that our metric produces perceptually more natural and
faithful transitions than existing density-based and naive baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Teamwork是一种灵活高效的统一解决方案，用于扩展输入输出通道并适应预训练扩散模型到新任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通道扩展方法通常针对特定应用，难以适应不同扩散模型或新任务。

Method: 通过协调和适应多个基础扩散模型实例（队友），使用改进的LoRA方法实现通道扩展和任务适应。

Result: 在多种生成和逆向图形任务中展示了灵活性和高效性。

Conclusion: Teamwork提供了一种无需修改预训练模型架构的通用解决方案。

Abstract: Large pretrained diffusion models can provide strong priors beneficial for
many graphics applications. However, generative applications such as neural
rendering and inverse methods such as SVBRDF estimation and intrinsic image
decomposition require additional input or output channels. Current solutions
for channel expansion are often application specific and these solutions can be
difficult to adapt to different diffusion models or new tasks. This paper
introduces Teamwork: a flexible and efficient unified solution for jointly
increasing the number of input and output channels as well as adapting a
pretrained diffusion model to new tasks. Teamwork achieves channel expansion
without altering the pretrained diffusion model architecture by coordinating
and adapting multiple instances of the base diffusion model (\ie, teammates).
We employ a novel variation of Low Rank-Adaptation (LoRA) to jointly address
both adaptation and coordination between the different teammates. Furthermore
Teamwork supports dynamic (de)activation of teammates. We demonstrate the
flexibility and efficiency of Teamwork on a variety of generative and inverse
graphics tasks such as inpainting, single image SVBRDF estimation, intrinsic
decomposition, neural shading, and intrinsic image synthesis.

*Owen Henkel,Bill Roberts,Doug Jaffe,Laurence Holt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在手写数学作业评分和反馈方面表现良好，但在视觉解释和教学判断方面仍有不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MLLMs在小学和初中数学教育中评分和分析手写作业的潜力，以减轻教师负担并提供学习过程洞察。

Method: 通过两个实验评估MLLMs的表现：实验A测试算术问题的评分准确性，实验B评估数学插图的视觉解释和教学判断能力。

Result: 实验A中MLLMs表现接近人类（95%准确率），实验B中直接评分效果差（k=0.20），但加入人类描述后显著提升（k=0.47）。

Conclusion: MLLMs在算术作业评分上表现优秀，但在视觉解释和教学判断方面仍需改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) raise the
question of their potential for grading, analyzing, and offering feedback on
handwritten student classwork. This capability would be particularly beneficial
in elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains
handwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides
valuable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely
time-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM
performance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines
288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving
arithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved
near-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human
educators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical
illustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the
answer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require
sophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to
analyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities
from their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student
illustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human
description of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze
the student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20
with ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement
levels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human
agreement levels. This gap suggests MLLMs can "see" and interpret arithmetic
work relatively well, but still struggle to "see" student mathematical
illustrations.

### [14] [Midway Network: Learning Representations for Recognition and Motion from Latent Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05558)
*Christopher Hoang,Mengye Ren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Midway Network是一种新的自监督学习架构，首次通过扩展潜在动态建模，从自然视频中学习对象识别和运动理解的强视觉表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习方法主要关注对象识别或运动理解的单一任务，而忽略了二者的协同学习。潜在动态建模在决策任务中表现良好，但尚未应用于视觉表示学习。

Method: Midway Network通过中途自上而下的路径推断视频帧间的运动潜在变量，并结合密集前向预测目标和分层结构处理复杂多对象场景。

Result: 在两大自然视频数据集上预训练后，Midway Network在语义分割和光流任务上优于现有自监督学习方法，其动态建模能通过前向特征扰动分析捕获高级对应关系。

Conclusion: Midway Network成功实现了对象识别和运动理解的协同学习，为自监督视觉表示学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: Object recognition and motion understanding are key components of perception
that complement each other. While self-supervised learning methods have shown
promise in their ability to learn from unlabeled data, they have primarily
focused on obtaining rich representations for either recognition or motion
rather than both in tandem. On the other hand, latent dynamics modeling has
been used in decision making to learn latent representations of observations
and their transformations over time for control and planning tasks. In this
work, we present Midway Network, a new self-supervised learning architecture
that is the first to learn strong visual representations for both object
recognition and motion understanding solely from natural videos, by extending
latent dynamics modeling to this domain. Midway Network leverages a midway
top-down path to infer motion latents between video frames, as well as a dense
forward prediction objective and hierarchical structure to tackle the complex,
multi-object scenes of natural videos. We demonstrate that after pretraining on
two large-scale natural video datasets, Midway Network achieves strong
performance on both semantic segmentation and optical flow tasks relative to
prior self-supervised learning methods. We also show that Midway Network's
learned dynamics can capture high-level correspondence via a novel analysis
method based on forward feature perturbation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D重建方法在几何完整性、交互性、物理合理性等方面存在不足，HoloScene旨在解决这些限制。

Method: 采用基于能量的优化问题，结合观测数据、物理约束和生成先验，通过采样探索和梯度细化进行高效优化。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异，数字孪生具有完整几何、物理稳定性和真实渲染能力。

Conclusion: HoloScene在交互游戏和实时数字孪生操作中展现出广泛适用性和高效性。

Abstract: Digitizing the physical world into accurate simulation-ready virtual
environments offers significant opportunities in a variety of fields such as
augmented and virtual reality, gaming, and robotics. However, current 3D
reconstruction and scene-understanding methods commonly fall short in one or
more critical aspects, such as geometry completeness, object interactivity,
physical plausibility, photorealistic rendering, or realistic physical
properties for reliable dynamic simulation. To address these limitations, we
introduce HoloScene, a novel interactive 3D reconstruction framework that
simultaneously achieves these requirements. HoloScene leverages a comprehensive
interactive scene-graph representation, encoding object geometry, appearance,
and physical properties alongside hierarchical and inter-object relationships.
Reconstruction is formulated as an energy-based optimization problem,
integrating observational data, physical constraints, and generative priors
into a unified, coherent objective. Optimization is efficiently performed via a
hybrid approach combining sampling-based exploration with gradient-based

physical stability, and realistic rendering from novel viewpoints. Evaluations
conducted on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate superior performance,
while practical use-cases in interactive gaming and real-time digital-twin
manipulation illustrate HoloScene's broad applicability and effectiveness.

### [16] [CalibCLIP: Contextual Calibration of Dominant Semantics for Text-Driven Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05586)
*Bin Kang,Bin Chen,Junjie Wang,Yulin Li,Junzhi Zhao,Zhuotao Tian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalibCLIP是一种无需训练的方法，用于校准视觉语言模型中主导令牌的抑制效应，提升图像检索任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在文本驱动的图像检索任务中，少数低贡献令牌可能过度捕获全局语义，抑制判别性特征。

Method: 在视觉空间中，提出对比视觉增强器（CVE）解耦视觉特征；在文本空间中，引入判别概念校准器（DCC）区分通用与判别性概念。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，CalibCLIP在三种图像检索任务中表现一致提升。

Conclusion: CalibCLIP通过校准主导令牌的抑制效应，有效提升了图像检索任务的性能。

Abstract: Existing Visual Language Models (VLMs) suffer structural limitations where a
few low contribution tokens may excessively capture global semantics,
dominating the information aggregation process and suppressing the
discriminative features in text-driven image retrieval tasks. To address this,
we introduce \textbf{CalibCLIP}, a training-free method designed to calibrate
the suppressive effect of dominant tokens. Specifically, in the visual space,
we propose the Contrastive Visual Enhancer (CVE), which decouples visual
features into target and low information regions. Subsequently, it identifies
dominant tokens and dynamically suppresses their representations.In the textual
space, we introduce the Discriminative Concept Calibrator (DCC), which aims to
differentiate between general and discriminative concepts within the text
query. By mitigating the challenges posed by generic concepts and improving the
representations of discriminative concepts, DCC strengthens the differentiation
among similar samples. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate consistent
improvements across seven benchmarks spanning three image retrieval tasks,
underscoring the effectiveness of CalibCLIP. Code is available at:

TL;DR: ShortCoTI是一种轻量级优化框架，通过减少Chain-of-Thought（CoT）推理的冗余，提升图像生成的效率，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在图像生成中使用CoT推理时，容易产生冗余（视觉过度思考），增加计算成本并可能引入与原始提示矛盾的细节。

Method: 提出ShortCoTI框架，通过自适应奖励函数和强化学习，优化CoT序列的简洁性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，推理长度减少54%，同时保持或略微提升图像质量。

Conclusion: ShortCoTI在不影响图像质量的前提下，显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive multimodal large language models have recently gained
popularity for image generation, driven by advances in foundation models. To
enhance alignment and detail, newer approaches employ chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, expanding user inputs into elaborated prompts prior to image
synthesis. However, this strategy can introduce unnecessary redundancy -- a
phenomenon we call visual overthinking -- which increases computational costs
and can introduce details that contradict the original prompt. In this work, we
explore how to generate more concise CoT sequences for more efficient image
generation. We introduce ShortCoTI, a lightweight optimization framework that
encourages more concise CoT while preserving output image quality. ShortCoTI
rewards more concise prompts with an adaptive function that scales according to
an estimated difficulty for each task. Incorporating this reward into a
reinforcement learning paradigm reduces prompt reasoning length by 54% while
maintaining or slightly improving quality metrics across multiple benchmarks
(T2I-CompBench, GenEval). Qualitative analysis shows that our method eliminates
verbose explanations and repetitive refinements, producing reasoning prompts
that are both concise and semantically rich. As a result, ShortCoTI improves
computational efficiency without compromising the fidelity or visual appeal of
generated images.

TL;DR: HOI-R1利用MLLMs和强化学习解决HOID任务，无需额外检测模块，性能提升2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HOID方法依赖VLMs先验知识，框架复杂且开发困难，MLLMs的推理能力未被充分探索。

Method: 提出HOI-R1，结合MLLMs和强化学习，设计HOI推理过程和奖励函数，纯文本解决HOID任务。

Result: 在HICO-DET数据集上，HOI-R1性能是基线的2倍，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: HOI-R1展示了MLLMs在HOID任务中的潜力，简化了框架并提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent Human-object interaction detection (HOID) methods highly require prior
knowledge from VLMs to enhance the interaction recognition capabilities. The
training strategies and model architectures for connecting the knowledge from
VLMs to the HOI instance representations from the object detector are
challenging, and the whole framework is complex for further development or
application. On the other hand, the inherent reasoning abilities of MLLMs on
human-object interaction detection are under-explored. Inspired by the recent
success of training MLLMs with reinforcement learning (RL) methods, we propose
HOI-R1 and first explore the potential of the language model on the HOID task
without any additional detection modules. We introduce an HOI reasoning process
and HOID reward functions to solve the HOID task by pure text. The results on
the HICO-DET dataset show that HOI-R1 achieves 2x the accuracy of the baseline
with great generalization ability. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的插拔式控制框架ECM，通过轻量级控制模块和分布式架构提升AR模型的生成效率和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR模型在复杂空间条件生成时需微调预训练模型，导致高昂训练成本。

Method: 采用分布式架构（上下文感知注意力层和共享门控FFN）和早期中心采样策略。

Result: 在规模AR模型上验证了高保真和多样化控制生成，超越基线并显著提升效率。

Conclusion: ECM框架在训练和推理效率上均有显著改进，同时保持生成质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated their
potential to rival diffusion models in image synthesis. However, for complex
spatially-conditioned generation, current AR approaches rely on fine-tuning the
pre-trained model, leading to significant training costs. In this paper, we
propose the Efficient Control Model (ECM), a plug-and-play framework featuring
a lightweight control module that introduces control signals via a distributed
architecture. This architecture consists of context-aware attention layers that
refine conditional features using real-time generated tokens, and a shared
gated feed-forward network (FFN) designed to maximize the utilization of its
limited capacity and ensure coherent control feature learning. Furthermore,
recognizing the critical role of early-stage generation in determining semantic
structure, we introduce an early-centric sampling strategy that prioritizes
learning early control sequences. This approach reduces computational cost by
lowering the number of training tokens per iteration, while a complementary
temperature scheduling during inference compensates for the resulting
insufficient training of late-stage tokens. Extensive experiments on
scale-based AR models validate that our method achieves high-fidelity and
diverse control over image generation, surpassing existing baselines while
significantly improving both training and inference efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在点云生成中因强制顺序预测而难以捕捉全局结构，导致性能落后于扩散模型。

Method: 提出PointNSP框架，采用多尺度分解和下一尺度预测范式，从粗到细生成点云。

Result: 在ShapeNet上达到SOTA生成质量，并在参数、训练和推理效率上超越扩散模型。

Conclusion: PointNSP展示了自回归模型在点云生成中的潜力，尤其在高效性和可扩展性方面表现突出。

Abstract: Autoregressive point cloud generation has long lagged behind diffusion-based
approaches in quality. The performance gap stems from the fact that
autoregressive models impose an artificial ordering on inherently unordered
point sets, forcing shape generation to proceed as a sequence of local
predictions. This sequential bias emphasizes short-range continuity but
undermines the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, hindering
its ability to enforce global structural properties such as symmetry,
consistent topology, and large-scale geometric regularities. Inspired by the
level-of-detail (LOD) principle in shape modeling, we propose PointNSP, a
coarse-to-fine generative framework that preserves global shape structure at
low resolutions and progressively refines fine-grained geometry at higher
scales through a next-scale prediction paradigm. This multi-scale factorization
aligns the autoregressive objective with the permutation-invariant nature of
point sets, enabling rich intra-scale interactions while avoiding brittle fixed
orderings. Experiments on ShapeNet show that PointNSP establishes
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generation quality for the first time within the
autoregressive paradigm. In addition, it surpasses strong diffusion-based
baselines in parameter, training, and inference efficiency. Finally, in dense
generation with 8,192 points, PointNSP's advantages become even more
pronounced, underscoring its scalability potential.

Abstract: Tear film break-up (TFBU) analysis is critical for diagnosing dry eye
syndrome, but automated TFBU segmentation remains challenging due to the lack
of annotated datasets and integrated solutions. This paper introduces the Tear
Film Multi-task (TFM) Dataset, the first comprehensive dataset for multi-task
tear film analysis, comprising 15 high-resolution videos (totaling 6,247
frames) annotated with three vision tasks: frame-level classification ('clear',
'closed', 'broken', 'blur'), Placido Ring detection, and pixel-wise TFBU area
segmentation. Leveraging this dataset, we first propose TF-Net, a novel and
efficient baseline segmentation model. TF-Net incorporates a MobileOne-mini
backbone with re-parameterization techniques and an enhanced feature pyramid
network to achieve a favorable balance between accuracy and computational
efficiency for real-time clinical applications. We further establish benchmark
performance on the TFM segmentation subset by comparing TF-Net against several
state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models. Furthermore, we design
TF-Collab, a novel integrated real-time pipeline that synergistically leverages
models trained on all three tasks of the TFM dataset. By sequentially
orchestrating frame classification for BUT determination, pupil region
localization for input standardization, and TFBU segmentation, TF-Collab fully
automates the analysis. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed TF-Net and TF-Collab, providing a foundation for future research
in ocular surface diagnostics. Our code and the TFM datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决地理空间基础模型（GFMs）部署中的自动化数据管道缺失和模型过大问题。

Method: 集成自动化数据整理、任务特定模型蒸馏和无缝部署。

Result: 模型体积缩小8倍，性能损失极小，并在作物分割任务中达到60.65%的mIoU。

Conclusion: InstaGeo将研究级GFMs转化为实用的低碳工具，推动地理空间AI向数据质量和应用驱动创新转变。

Abstract: Open-access multispectral imagery from missions like Landsat 8-9 and
Sentinel-2 has fueled the development of geospatial foundation models (GFMs)
for humanitarian and environmental applications. Yet, their deployment remains
limited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the
large size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing
raw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full
complexity of the original encoder.
  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses
these challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw
imagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to
derive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as
interactive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from
three published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of
-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for
desert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than
standard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal
accuracy loss.
  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger
crop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp
improvement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress
from raw data to model deployment within a single working day.
  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo
transforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,
large-scale Earth observation. This approach shifts geospatial AI toward data
quality and application-driven innovation. Source code, datasets, and model
checkpoints are available at:

Result: 大多数检测器并不依赖频谱峰值，表明现有假设可能不成立。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更透明、可靠的取证工具提供了新方向。

Abstract: Over the years, the forensics community has proposed several deep
learning-based detectors to mitigate the risks of generative AI. Recently,
frequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude
spectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often
considered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,
state-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still
remains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their
interpretability and trust. In this work, we conduct a systematic study to
address this question. We propose a strategy to remove spectral peaks from
images and analyze the impact of this operation on several detectors. In
addition, we introduce a simple linear detector that relies exclusively on
frequency peaks, providing a fully interpretable baseline free from the
confounding influence of deep learning. Our findings reveal that most detectors
are not fundamentally dependent on spectral peaks, challenging a widespread
assumption in the field and paving the way for more transparent and reliable
forensic tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双曲空间能表示更丰富的结构（如树结构），但尚未有监督代理损失函数应用于双曲空间。代理损失函数在大规模数据集上训练复杂度低，因此具有吸引力。

Method: 提出CHEST损失函数，结合双曲和欧几里得空间的代理损失，以及基于双曲层次聚类的正则化损失。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上评估，实现了新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: CHEST损失函数通过结合双曲和欧几里得空间，显著提升了深度度量学习的性能。

Abstract: Deep metric learning (DML) aims to learn a neural network mapping data to an
embedding space, which can represent semantic similarity between data points.
Hyperbolic space is attractive for DML since it can represent richer
structures, such as tree structures. DML in hyperbolic space is based on
pair-based loss or unsupervised regularization loss. On the other hand,
supervised proxy-based losses in hyperbolic space have not been reported yet
due to some issues in applying proxy-based losses in a hyperbolic space.
However, proxy-based losses are attractive for large-scale datasets since they
have less training complexity. To address these, this paper proposes the
Combined Hyperbolic and Euclidean Soft Triple (CHEST) loss. CHEST loss is
composed of the proxy-based losses in hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces and the
regularization loss based on hyperbolic hierarchical clustering. We find that
the combination of hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces improves DML accuracy and
learning stability for both spaces. Finally, we evaluate the CHEST loss on four
benchmark datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 论文提出两种深度学习框架：AHP-CADNet用于自动诊断异常头位姿势，以及基于课程学习的数据填补框架，以解决临床数据缺失问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常头位姿势（AHP）的早期诊断对减少并发症至关重要，但现有临床评估主观且数据不完整。

Method: AHP-CADNet通过多级注意力融合框架整合眼部标志、头部姿势特征和临床属性；数据填补框架利用课程学习逐步处理缺失数据。

Result: AHP-CADNet在分类任务中准确率达96.9-99.0%，填补框架在临床变量中保持高准确率（93.46-99.78%）。

Conclusion: 两种框架在自动诊断和数据填补方面均有效，适用于临床环境。

Abstract: Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that
arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling
patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis
minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry;
however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further
complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges
through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a
multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates
ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to
generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based
imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively
leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance
diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the
PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet
achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low
prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to
0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy
across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with
clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001).
These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated
diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注短期或单代理设置，难以系统研究课堂复杂性和跨任务复用，因此需要开发支持多代理、多会话的模拟空间。

Method: 基于CIE（认知-交互-进化）架构，EduVerse支持环境、代理和会话的定制，并允许真实用户通过人机交互界面参与。

Result: 实验验证显示EduVerse在教学对齐、群体互动和跨会话进化方面表现优异，模拟结果与真实课堂数据高度吻合。

Conclusion: EduVerse在真实性、可复现性和可解释性之间取得平衡，为教育AI提供了一个可扩展的平台，并将开源以促进跨学科研究。

Abstract: Reproducing cognitive development, group interaction, and long-term evolution
in virtual classrooms remains a core challenge for educational AI, as real
classrooms integrate open-ended cognition, dynamic social interaction,
affective factors, and multi-session development rarely captured together.
Existing approaches mostly focus on short-term or single-agent settings,
limiting systematic study of classroom complexity and cross-task reuse. We
present EduVerse, the first user-defined multi-agent simulation space that
supports environment, agent, and session customization. A distinctive
human-in-the-loop interface further allows real users to join the space. Built
on a layered CIE (Cognition-Interaction-Evolution) architecture, EduVerse
ensures individual consistency, authentic interaction, and longitudinal
adaptation in cognition, emotion, and behavior-reproducing realistic classroom
dynamics with seamless human-agent integration. We validate EduVerse in
middle-school Chinese classes across three text genres, environments, and
multiple sessions. Results show: (1) Instructional alignment: simulated IRF
rates (0.28-0.64) closely match real classrooms (0.37-0.49), indicating
pedagogical realism; (2) Group interaction and role differentiation: network
density (0.27-0.40) with about one-third of peer links realized, while
human-agent tasks indicate a balance between individual variability and
instructional stability; (3) Cross-session evolution: the positive transition
rate R+ increase by 11.7% on average, capturing longitudinal shifts in
behavior, emotion, and cognition and revealing structured learning
trajectories. Overall, EduVerse balances realism, reproducibility, and
interpretability, providing a scalable platform for educational AI. The system
will be open-sourced to foster cross-disciplinary research.

Motivation: 减少对深度传感器的依赖，降低成本并简化SLAM系统。

Method: 使用三个预训练模块（深度估计、关键点检测、实例分割）生成3D特征，结合RGB-D SLAM后端处理。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D基准测试中，静态序列平均ATE为7.4 cm，动态序列为1.8 cm，性能媲美RGB-D方法。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉模型可替代深度传感器，推动更简单、经济的SLAM系统发展。

Abstract: We present DropD-SLAM, a real-time monocular SLAM system that achieves
RGB-D-level accuracy without relying on depth sensors. The system replaces
active depth input with three pretrained vision modules: a monocular metric
depth estimator, a learned keypoint detector, and an instance segmentation
network. Dynamic objects are suppressed using dilated instance masks, while
static keypoints are assigned predicted depth values and backprojected into 3D
to form metrically scaled features. These are processed by an unmodified RGB-D
SLAM back end for tracking and mapping. On the TUM RGB-D benchmark, DropD-SLAM
attains 7.4 cm mean ATE on static sequences and 1.8 cm on dynamic sequences,
matching or surpassing state-of-the-art RGB-D methods while operating at 22 FPS
on a single GPU. These results suggest that modern pretrained vision models can
replace active depth sensors as reliable, real-time sources of metric scale,
marking a step toward simpler and more cost-effective SLAM systems.

Conclusion: SD-MVSum通过多模态融合提升了视频摘要的准确性，并扩展了相关数据集。

Abstract: In this work, we extend a recent method for script-driven video
summarization, originally considering just the visual content of the video, to
take into account the relevance of the user-provided script also with the
video's spoken content. In the proposed method, SD-MVSum, the dependence
between each considered pair of data modalities, i.e., script-video and
script-transcript, is modeled using a new weighted cross-modal attention
mechanism. This explicitly exploits the semantic similarity between the paired
modalities in order to promote the parts of the full-length video with the
highest relevance to the user-provided script. Furthermore, we extend two
large-scale datasets for video summarization (S-VideoXum, MrHiSum), to make
them suitable for training and evaluation of script-driven multimodal video
summarization methods. Experimental comparisons document the competitiveness of
our SD-MVSum method against other SOTA approaches for script-driven and generic
video summarization. Our new method and extended datasets are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肝癌组织学分型在临床诊断中至关重要，但现有方法未能充分利用WSIs中的多层次信息，导致分型性能不佳。

Method: ARGUS通过构建微观几何特征、设计层次视野对齐模块，并融合多层次特征，实现了对肝癌WSIs的精细建模。

Result: 在公共和私有数据集上，ARGUS达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ARGUS为肝癌临床诊断提供了一种有效的工具。

Abstract: Primary liver malignancies are widely recognized as the most heterogeneous
and prognostically diverse cancers of the digestive system. Among these,
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) emerge
as the two principal histological subtypes, demonstrating significantly greater
complexity in tissue morphology and cellular architecture than other common
tumors. The intricate representation of features in Whole Slide Images (WSIs)
encompasses abundant crucial information for liver cancer histological
subtyping, regarding hierarchical pyramid structure, tumor microenvironment
(TME), and geometric representation. However, recent approaches have not
adequately exploited these indispensable effective descriptors, resulting in a
limited understanding of histological representation and suboptimal subtyping
performance. To mitigate these limitations, ARGUS is proposed to advance
histological subtyping in liver cancer by capturing the macro-meso-micro
hierarchical information within the TME. Specifically, we first construct a
micro-geometry feature to represent fine-grained cell-level pattern via a
geometric structure across nuclei, thereby providing a more refined and precise
perspective for delineating pathological images. Then, a Hierarchical
Field-of-Views (FoVs) Alignment module is designed to model macro- and
meso-level hierarchical interactions inherent in WSIs. Finally, the augmented
micro-geometry and FoVs features are fused into a joint representation via
present Geometry Prior Guided Fusion strategy for modeling holistic phenotype
interactions. Extensive experiments on public and private cohorts demonstrate
that our ARGUS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in histological
subtyping of liver cancer, which provide an effective diagnostic tool for
primary liver malignancies in clinical practice.

Abstract: The task of realistically inserting a human from a reference image into a
background scene is highly challenging, requiring the model to (1) determine
the correct location and poses of the person and (2) perform high-quality
personalization conditioned on the background. Previous approaches often treat
them as separate problems, overlooking their interconnections, and typically
rely on training to achieve high performance. In this work, we introduce a
unified training-free pipeline that leverages pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. We show that diffusion models inherently possess the
knowledge to place people in complex scenes without requiring task-specific
training. By combining inversion techniques with classifier-free guidance, our
method achieves affordance-aware global editing, seamlessly inserting people
into scenes. Furthermore, our proposed mask-guided self-attention mechanism
ensures high-quality personalization, preserving the subject's identity,
clothing, and body features from just a single reference image. To the best of
our knowledge, we are the first to perform realistic human insertions into
scenes in a training-free manner and achieve state-of-the-art results in
diverse composite scene images with excellent identity preservation in
backgrounds and subjects.

Result: 模型在剪切点检测和视觉镜头选择上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该研究在多模态自动视频编辑领域取得了进展。

Abstract: Automated video editing remains an underexplored task in the computer vision
and multimedia domains, especially when contrasted with the growing interest in
video generation and scene understanding. In this work, we address the specific
challenge of editing multicamera recordings of classical music concerts by
decomposing the problem into two key sub-tasks: when to cut and how to cut.
Building on recent literature, we propose a novel multimodal architecture for
the temporal segmentation task (when to cut), which integrates log-mel
spectrograms from the audio signals, plus an optional image embedding, and
scalar temporal features through a lightweight convolutional-transformer
pipeline. For the spatial selection task (how to cut), we improve the
literature by updating from old backbones, e.g. ResNet, with a CLIP-based
encoder and constraining distractor selection to segments from the same
concert. Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in
which raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.
We show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points
and provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art
in multimodal automated video editing.

Motivation: 评估R. solani对生菜种子萌发和早期生长的具体影响，并验证低成本成像硬件与先进计算工具结合的可行性。

Method: 使用多摄像头连续拍摄感染组和对照组的萌发过程，开发了结合形态和空间特征的图像分析算法，并引入时间整合技术。

Result: R. solani感染显著降低萌发率和幼苗活力；算法在复杂条件下（如叶片重叠）仍能高精度计数（R²=0.98，RMSE=1.12）。

Conclusion: 该方法为非破坏性、可扩展的表型分析提供了可靠工具，尤其在传统技术失效的复杂场景中表现优异。

Abstract: The study investigates the effects of R. solani inoculation on the
germination and early development of Lactuca sativa L. seeds using a low-cost,
image-based monitoring system. Multiple cameras were deployed to continuously
capture images of the germination process in both infected and control groups.
The objective was to assess the impact of the pathogen by analyzing germination
dynamics and growth over time. To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline
was developed. The algorithm integrates both morphological and spatial features
to identify and quantify individual seedlings, even under complex conditions
where traditional image analyses fails. A key innovation of the method lies in
its temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current
status but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach
enables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when
overlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method
demonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in
challenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth. Results
confirm that R. solani infection significantly reduces germination rates and
early seedling vigor. The study also validates the feasibility of combining
low-cost imaging hardware with advanced computational tools to obtain
phenotyping data in a non-destructive and scalable manner. The temporal
integration enabled accurate quantification of germinated seeds and precise
determination of seedling emergence timing. This approach proved particularly
effective in later stages of the experiment, where conventional segmentation
techniques failed due to overlapping or intertwined seedlings, making accurate
counting. The method achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.98 and a root
mean square error (RMSE) of 1.12, demonstrating its robustness and reliability.

Conclusion: 研究强调了对象级编码的有效性，为开发更强的视觉编码器和分词器提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in language modeling have witnessed the rise of highly
desirable emergent capabilities, such as reasoning and in-context learning.
However, vision models have yet to exhibit comparable progress in these areas.
In this paper, we argue that this gap could stem from the lack of semantic and
contextual guidance in current vision transformer (ViT) training schemes, and
such a gap can be narrowed through the design of a semantic-grounded objective.
Specifically, we notice that individual words in natural language are
inherently semantic, and modeling directly on word tokens naturally learns a
realistic distribution. In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which
inevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to
directly model "object" as the visual equivalence of "word," pushing the model
to learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate
our hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach
can be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random
patches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations
reveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a
real-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned
without it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual
question answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning
and contextual understanding gained with this simple objective. We hope our
study highlights the effectiveness of object-level encoding and provides a
plausible direction for developing stronger vision encoders and tokenizers.
Code and model will be publicly released. Keywords: Semantic Visual Tokenizer,

Result: AgeBooth能生成高质量、身份一致的跨年龄人脸图像，实验显示其优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AgeBooth在年龄控制和视觉质量上表现优异，无需依赖大量标注数据。

Abstract: Recent diffusion model research focuses on generating identity-consistent
images from a reference photo, but they struggle to accurately control age
while preserving identity, and fine-tuning such models often requires costly
paired images across ages. In this paper, we propose AgeBooth, a novel
age-specific finetuning approach that can effectively enhance the age control
capability of adapterbased identity personalization models without the need for
expensive age-varied datasets. To reduce dependence on a large amount of
age-labeled data, we exploit the linear nature of aging by introducing
age-conditioned prompt blending and an age-specific LoRA fusion strategy that
leverages SVDMix, a matrix fusion technique. These techniques enable
high-quality generation of intermediate-age portraits. Our AgeBooth produces
realistic and identity-consistent face images across different ages from a
single reference image. Experiments show that AgeBooth achieves superior age
control and visual quality compared to previous state-of-the-art editing-based
methods.

Abstract: Generating enough and diverse data through augmentation offers an efficient
solution to the time-consuming and labour-intensive process of collecting and
annotating pixel-wise images. Traditional data augmentation techniques often
face challenges in manipulating high-level semantic attributes, such as
materials and textures. In contrast, diffusion models offer a robust
alternative, by effectively utilizing text-to-image or image-to-image
transformation. However, existing diffusion-based methods are either
computationally expensive or compromise on performance. To address this issue,
we introduce a novel training-free pipeline that integrates pretrained
ControlNet and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate synthetic images
paired with pixel-level labels. This approach eliminates the need for manual
annotations and significantly improves downstream tasks. To improve the
fidelity and diversity, we add a Multi-way Prompt Generator, Mask Generator and
High-quality Image Selection module. Our results on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i
present promising performance and outperform concurrent work for one-shot
semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: 论文不仅提出了高性能检测器，还提供了新基准和框架，推动了通用AI图像检测的发展。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative models has made it increasingly crucial
to develop detectors that can reliably detect synthetic images. Although most
of the work has now focused on cross-generator generalization, we argue that
this viewpoint is too limited. Detecting synthetic images involves another
equally important challenge: generalization across visual domains. To bridge
this gap,we present the OmniGen Benchmark. This comprehensive evaluation
dataset incorporates 12 state-of-the-art generators, providing a more realistic
way of evaluating detector performance under realistic conditions. In addition,
we introduce a new method, FusionDetect, aimed at addressing both vectors of
generalization. FusionDetect draws on the benefits of two frozen foundation
models: CLIP & Dinov2. By deriving features from both complementary models,we
develop a cohesive feature space that naturally adapts to changes in both
thecontent and design of the generator. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that FusionDetect delivers not only a new state-of-the-art, which is 3.87% more
accurate than its closest competitor and 6.13% more precise on average on
established benchmarks, but also achieves a 4.48% increase in accuracy on
OmniGen,along with exceptional robustness to common image perturbations. We
introduce not only a top-performing detector, but also a new benchmark and
framework for furthering universal AI image detection. The code and dataset are

Conclusion: ALISE展示了无监督方法在LiDAR实例分割中的潜力，显著减少对人工标注的依赖。

Abstract: The manual annotation of outdoor LiDAR point clouds for instance segmentation
is extremely costly and time-consuming. Current methods attempt to reduce this
burden but still rely on some form of human labeling. To completely eliminate
this dependency, we introduce ALISE, a novel framework that performs LiDAR
instance segmentation without any annotations. The central challenge is to
generate high-quality pseudo-labels in a fully unsupervised manner. Our
approach starts by employing Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), guided by text
and images, to produce initial pseudo-labels. We then refine these labels
through a dedicated spatio-temporal voting module, which combines 2D and 3D
semantics for both offline and online optimization. To achieve superior feature
learning, we further introduce two forms of semantic supervision: a set of 2D
prior-based losses that inject visual knowledge into the 3D network, and a
novel prototype-based contrastive loss that builds a discriminative feature
space by exploiting 3D semantic consistency. This comprehensive design results
in significant performance gains, establishing a new state-of-the-art for
unsupervised 3D instance segmentation. Remarkably, our approach even
outperforms MWSIS, a method that operates with supervision from ground-truth
(GT) 2D bounding boxes by a margin of 2.53% in mAP (50.95% vs. 48.42%).

Method: OneVision采用VRQ（视觉对齐残差量化编码）对齐多视角表示，并通过多阶段语义对齐方案结合用户个性化信息。

Conclusion: OneVision证明了以语义ID为中心的生成架构可以统一检索和个性化，同时简化服务路径。

Abstract: Traditional vision search, similar to search and recommendation systems,
follows the multi-stage cascading architecture (MCA) paradigm to balance
efficiency and conversion. Specifically, the query image undergoes feature
extraction, recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages, ultimately presenting the
user with semantically similar products that meet their preferences. This
multi-view representation discrepancy of the same object in the query and the
optimization objective collide across these stages, making it difficult to
achieve Pareto optimality in both user experience and conversion. In this
paper, an end-to-end generative framework, OneVision, is proposed to address
these problems. OneVision builds on VRQ, a vision-aligned residual quantization
encoding, which can align the vastly different representations of an object
across multiple viewpoints while preserving the distinctive features of each
product as much as possible. Then a multi-stage semantic alignment scheme is
adopted to maintain strong visual similarity priors while effectively
incorporating user-specific information for personalized preference generation.
In offline evaluations, OneVision performs on par with online MCA, while
improving inference efficiency by 21% through dynamic pruning. In A/B tests, it
achieves significant online improvements: +2.15% item CTR, +2.27% CVR, and
+3.12% order volume. These results demonstrate that a semantic ID centric,
generative architecture can unify retrieval and personalization while
simplifying the serving pathway.

Conclusion: 通过误差统计矩阵加权多源弱标签数据，显著提升了深度网络在遥感图像分类中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Deep learning has gained broad interest in remote sensing image scene
classification thanks to the effectiveness of deep neural networks in
extracting the semantics from complex data. However, deep networks require
large amounts of training samples to obtain good generalization capabilities
and are sensitive to errors in the training labels. This is a problem in remote
sensing since highly reliable labels can be obtained at high costs and in
limited amount. However, many sources of less reliable labeled data are
available, e.g., obsolete digital maps. In order to train deep networks with
larger datasets, we propose both the combination of single or multiple weak
sources of labeled data with a small but reliable dataset to generate
multisource labeled datasets and a novel training strategy where the
reliability of each source is taken in consideration. This is done by
exploiting the transition matrices describing the statistics of the errors of
each source. The transition matrices are embedded into the labels and used
during the training process to weigh each label according to the related
source. The proposed method acts as a weighting scheme at gradient level, where
each instance contributes with different weights to the optimization of
different classes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by
experiments on different datasets. The results proved the robustness and
capability of leveraging on unreliable source of labels of the proposed method.

Result: 在远OOD和近OOD基准测试中，检测精度分别提升10%和7%。

Conclusion: 中间层信号对OOD检测至关重要，为研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for reliably deploying
machine learning models in the wild. Yet, most methods treat large pre-trained
models as monolithic encoders and rely solely on their final-layer
representations for detection. We challenge this wisdom. We reveal the
\textit{intermediate layers} of pre-trained models, shaped by residual
connections that subtly transform input projections, \textit{can} encode
\textit{surprisingly rich and diverse signals} for detecting distributional
shifts. Importantly, to exploit latent representation diversity across layers,
we introduce an entropy-based criterion to \textit{automatically} identify
layers offering the most complementary information in a training-free setting
-- \textit{without access to OOD data}. We show that selectively incorporating
these intermediate representations can increase the accuracy of OOD detection
by up to \textbf{$10\%$} in far-OOD and over \textbf{$7\%$} in near-OOD
benchmarks compared to state-of-the-art training-free methods across various
model architectures and training objectives. Our findings reveal a new avenue
for OOD detection research and uncover the impact of various training
objectives and model architectures on confidence-based OOD detection methods.

Abstract: The Steered Mixture of Experts regression framework has demonstrated strong
performance in image reconstruction, compression, denoising, and
super-resolution. However, its high computational cost limits practical
applications. This work introduces a rasterization-based optimization strategy
that combines the efficiency of rasterized Gaussian kernel rendering with the
edge-aware gating mechanism of the Steered Mixture of Experts. The proposed
method is designed to accelerate two-dimensional image regression while
maintaining the model's inherent sparsity and reconstruction quality. By
replacing global iterative optimization with a rasterized formulation, the
method achieves significantly faster parameter updates and more
memory-efficient model representations. In addition, the proposed framework
supports applications such as native super-resolution and image denoising,
which are not directly achievable with standard rasterized Gaussian kernel
approaches. The combination of fast rasterized optimization with the edge-aware
structure of the Steered Mixture of Experts provides a new balance between
computational efficiency and reconstruction fidelity for two-dimensional image
processing tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了跨患者和跨周期的心脏动态对齐分析，不受周期或相位长度限制。

Abstract: Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is the gold standard for assessing
cardiac function, but individual cardiac cycles complicate automatic temporal
comparison or sub-phase analysis. Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can
eliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole
(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do
not provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a
self-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis
(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable
registration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion
descriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction
and relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are
determined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated
for both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets. M&Ms-2
(n=360) dataset was used for training and evaluation, and M&Ms (n=345) and ACDC
(n=100) datasets for repeatability control. Furthermore, generalisability to
patients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German
Competence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved
improved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED
and ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the
volume-based approach. We can detect ED and ES, as well as three additional
keyframes throughout the cardiac cycle with a mean cFD below 1.31 frames for
SAX and 1.73 for LAX. Our approach enables temporally aligned inter- and
intra-patient analysis of cardiac dynamics, irrespective of cycle or phase
lengths. GitHub repository:

Conclusion: Flow4Agent通过运动先验有效提升长视频理解能力，为未来研究提供新方向。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding has always been a challenging problem due to
the significant redundancy in both temporal and spatial contents. This
challenge is further exacerbated by the limited context length of Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs). To address this issue, many previous works have
attempted to extract key video information, where the "key" is typically
semantic-aware and heavily dependent on the CLIP model as prior. In this paper,
we propose Flow4Agent, a novel framework that pioneeringly incorporates motion
priors from optical flow to facilitate LLM-based long video understanding.
Flow4Agent mitigates the redundancy in long videos at both temporal and spatial
levels through two core modules: Temporal Granularity Optimization (TGO)
adaptively refines framelevel hierarchies, which first leverages coarse flow
priors to group similar visual contents and then applies semantic priors to
filter out highly irrelevant scene information. Motion Token Pruning (MTP)
further refines the intra-frame visual representations, pruning high-redundancy
video tokens using fine-grained optical flow information. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our Flow4Agent outperforms existing methods across a wide
range of video MLLM benchmarks, especially for hour-level video understanding
tasks, achieving 64.7% on Video-MME, 71.4% on MLVU and 60.4% on LongVideoBench.

bioprocessing. High-throughput setups with tens to hundreds of parallel cell
cultivations offer the potential for robust and reproducible insights. However,
these insights are obscured by the large amount of LCI data recorded per
experiment. Recent advances in state-of-the-art deep learning methods for cell
segmentation and tracking now enable the automated analysis of such large data
volumes, offering unprecedented opportunities to systematically study
single-cell dynamics. The next key challenge lies in integrating these powerful
tools into accessible, flexible, and user-friendly workflows that support
routine application in biological research. In this work, we present
acia-workflows, a platform that combines three key components: (1) the
Automated live-Cell Imaging Analysis (acia) Python library, which supports the
modular design of image analysis pipelines offering eight deep learning
segmentation and tracking approaches; (2) workflows that assemble the image
analysis pipeline, its software dependencies, documentation, and visualizations
into a single Jupyter Notebook, leading to accessible, reproducible and
scalable analysis workflows; and (3) a collection of application workflows
showcasing the analysis and customization capabilities in real-world
applications. Specifically, we present three workflows to investigate various
types of microfluidic LCI experiments ranging from growth rate comparisons to
precise, minute-resolution quantitative analyses of individual dynamic cells
responses to changing oxygen conditions. Our collection of more than ten
application workflows is open source and publicly available at

TL;DR: BioAutoML-NAS是一种利用多模态数据和神经架构搜索（NAS）的模型，用于高效准确的昆虫分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 昆虫分类对农业管理和生态研究至关重要，但由于昆虫的复杂特性、类别不平衡和大规模数据集，这一任务具有挑战性。

Method: BioAutoML-NAS结合图像和元数据，通过NAS自动学习最佳操作，并采用交替双层优化训练策略和零操作来优化网络结构。

Result: 在BIOSCAN-5M数据集上，BioAutoML-NAS达到96.81%准确率，显著优于现有方法；在Insects-1M数据集上也表现优异。

Conclusion: BioAutoML-NAS为现代可持续农业提供了准确且高效的昆虫分类解决方案。

Abstract: Insect classification is important for agricultural management and ecological
research, as it directly affects crop health and production. However, this task
remains challenging due to the complex characteristics of insects, class
imbalance, and large-scale datasets. To address these issues, we propose
BioAutoML-NAS, the first BioAutoML model using multimodal data, including
images, and metadata, which applies neural architecture search (NAS) for images
to automatically learn the best operations for each connection within each
cell. Multiple cells are stacked to form the full network, each extracting
detailed image feature representations. A multimodal fusion module combines
image embeddings with metadata, allowing the model to use both visual and
categorical biological information to classify insects. An alternating bi-level
optimization training strategy jointly updates network weights and architecture
parameters, while zero operations remove less important connections, producing
sparse, efficient, and high-performing architectures. Extensive evaluation on
the BIOSCAN-5M dataset demonstrates that BioAutoML-NAS achieves 96.81%
accuracy, 97.46% precision, 96.81% recall, and a 97.05% F1 score, outperforming
state-of-the-art transfer learning, transformer, AutoML, and NAS methods by
approximately 16%, 10%, and 8% respectively. Further validation on the
Insects-1M dataset obtains 93.25% accuracy, 93.71% precision, 92.74% recall,
and a 93.22% F1 score. These results demonstrate that BioAutoML-NAS provides
accurate, confident insect classification that supports modern sustainable
farming.

Conclusion: D3QE能有效检测自回归生成的图像，具有鲁棒性和泛化性。

Abstract: The emergence of visual autoregressive (AR) models has revolutionized image
generation while presenting new challenges for synthetic image detection.
Unlike previous GAN or diffusion-based methods, AR models generate images
through discrete token prediction, exhibiting both marked improvements in image
synthesis quality and unique characteristics in their vector-quantized
representations. In this paper, we propose to leverage Discrete Distribution
Discrepancy-aware Quantization Error (D$^3$QE) for autoregressive-generated
image detection that exploits the distinctive patterns and the frequency
distribution bias of the codebook existing in real and fake images. We
introduce a discrete distribution discrepancy-aware transformer that integrates
dynamic codebook frequency statistics into its attention mechanism, fusing
semantic features and quantization error latent. To evaluate our method, we
construct a comprehensive dataset termed ARForensics covering 7 mainstream
visual AR models. Experiments demonstrate superior detection accuracy and
strong generalization of D$^3$QE across different AR models, with robustness to
real-world perturbations. Code is available at

TL;DR: WS-ICL是一种新的医学图像分割方法，通过弱监督提示（如边界框或点）减少标注成本，性能接近传统ICL模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ICL模型需要密集标注和重复用户提示，标注成本高。WS-ICL旨在通过弱监督提示降低标注负担。

Method: 提出WS-ICL，利用弱提示（如边界框或点）代替密集标注，减少标注成本。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，WS-ICL性能接近传统ICL模型，且标注成本显著降低。

Conclusion: WS-ICL是一种高效且统一的医学图像分割方法，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Universal models for medical image segmentation, such as interactive and
in-context learning (ICL) models, offer strong generalization but require
extensive annotations. Interactive models need repeated user prompts for each
image, while ICL relies on dense, pixel-level labels. To address this, we
propose Weakly Supervised In-Context Learning (WS-ICL), a new ICL paradigm that
leverages weak prompts (e.g., bounding boxes or points) instead of dense labels
for context. This approach significantly reduces annotation effort by
eliminating the need for fine-grained masks and repeated user prompting for all
images. We evaluated the proposed WS-ICL model on three held-out benchmarks.
Experimental results demonstrate that WS-ICL achieves performance comparable to
regular ICL models at a significantly lower annotation cost. In addition,
WS-ICL is highly competitive even under the interactive paradigm. These
findings establish WS-ICL as a promising step toward more efficient and unified
universal models for medical image segmentation. Our code and model are
publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Weak-ICL.

TL;DR: 提出一个大规模物流缺陷检测数据集，填补现有制造业异常检测数据集的不足，挑战现有方法的性能极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测数据集（如MVTec-AD和VisA）在制造业场景中表现饱和，但物流零售场景中物体姿态和外观多样性带来新挑战，现有方法表现不佳。

Method: 引入一个包含23万张图像（含2.9万缺陷实例）的新数据集，规模是MVTec-AD的40倍，并评估多种先进方法的性能。

Result: 现有方法在新数据集上最高仅达56.96% AUROC，远低于制造业场景的99.9%，表明其难以应对物流场景的多样性。

Conclusion: 新数据集为物流异常检测设定了新基准，推动未来研究解决这一挑战性问题。

Abstract: We present a novel large-scale dataset for defect detection in a logistics
setting. Recent work on industrial anomaly detection has primarily focused on
manufacturing scenarios with highly controlled poses and a limited number of
object categories. Existing benchmarks like MVTec-AD [6] and VisA [33] have
reached saturation, with state-of-the-art methods achieving up to 99.9% AUROC
scores. In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics
faces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object
pose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied
to this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that
overcomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000
images (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than
MVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the
difficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple
state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not
surpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset. Further qualitative analysis confirms that
existing methods struggle to leverage normal samples under heavy pose and
appearance variation. With our large-scale dataset, we set a new benchmark and
encourage future research towards solving this challenging problem in retail
logistics anomaly detection. The dataset is available for download under

TL;DR: MetaFormer架构在医学影像中的首次全面研究，比较了不同token mixers在分类和分割任务中的表现，发现低复杂度mixers适合分类，卷积mixers适合分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MetaFormer在医学影像中的应用，填补现有研究空白，比较不同token mixers的效果。

Method: 系统分析pooling、convolution和attention-based token mixers在MetaFormer中的表现，覆盖8个医学数据集。

Result: 分类任务中低复杂度mixers足够，分割任务中卷积mixers更优；预训练权重仍有效。

Conclusion: 医学影像中，分类任务适合简单mixers，分割任务需卷积mixers，分组卷积是优选。

Abstract: The generalization of the Transformer architecture via MetaFormer has
reshaped our understanding of its success in computer vision. By replacing
self-attention with simpler token mixers, MetaFormer provides strong baselines
for vision tasks. However, while extensively studied on natural image datasets,
its use in medical imaging remains scarce, and existing works rarely compare
different token mixers, potentially overlooking more suitable designs choices.
In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of token mixers for
medical imaging. We systematically analyze pooling-, convolution-, and
attention-based token mixers within the MetaFormer architecture on image
classification (global prediction task) and semantic segmentation (dense
prediction task). Our evaluation spans eight datasets covering diverse
modalities and common challenges in the medical domain. Given the prevalence of
pretraining from natural images to mitigate medical data scarcity, we also
examine transferring pretrained weights to new token mixers. Our results show
that, for classification, low-complexity token mixers (e.g. grouped convolution
or pooling) are sufficient, aligning with findings on natural images.
Pretrained weights remain useful despite the domain gap introduced by the new
token mixer. For segmentation, we find that the local inductive bias of
convolutional token mixers is essential. Grouped convolutions emerge as the
preferred choice, as they reduce runtime and parameter count compared to
standard convolutions, while the MetaFormer's channel-MLPs already provide the
necessary cross-channel interactions. Our code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 该综述旨在指导未来扩散模型在LLIE中的研究，包括新条件、实时适应和基础模型的潜力。

Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) is vital for safety-critical applications
such as surveillance, autonomous navigation, and medical imaging, where
visibility degradation can impair downstream task performance. Recently,
diffusion models have emerged as a promising generative paradigm for LLIE due
to their capacity to model complex image distributions via iterative denoising.
This survey provides an up-to-date critical analysis of diffusion models for
LLIE, distinctively featuring an in-depth comparative performance evaluation
against Generative Adversarial Network and Transformer-based state-of-the-art
methods, a thorough examination of practical deployment challenges, and a
forward-looking perspective on the role of emerging paradigms like foundation
models. We propose a multi-perspective taxonomy encompassing six categories:
Intrinsic Decomposition, Spectral & Latent, Accelerated, Guided, Multimodal,
and Autonomous; that map enhancement methods across physical priors,
conditioning schemes, and computational efficiency. Our taxonomy is grounded in
a hybrid view of both the model mechanism and the conditioning signals. We
evaluate qualitative failure modes, benchmark inconsistencies, and trade-offs
between interpretability, generalization, and inference efficiency. We also
discuss real-world deployment constraints (e.g., memory, energy use) and
ethical considerations. This survey aims to guide the next generation of
diffusion-based LLIE research by highlighting trends and surfacing open
research questions, including novel conditioning, real-time adaptation, and the
potential of foundation models.

Result: 在Adobe 240fps数据集上验证了DMCA的去噪效果，并展示了其在提升信噪比和分离目标与背景方面的能力。

Conclusion: DMCA在视频和雷达图像处理中表现出色，能够有效分离不同形态的信号源。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel methodology of adapting the representation of
videos based on the dynamics of their scene content variation. In particular,
we demonstrate how the clustering of dynamic mode decomposition eigenvalues can
be leveraged to learn an adaptive video representation for separating
structurally distinct morphologies of a video. We extend the morphological
component analysis (MCA) algorithm, which uses multiple predefined incoherent
dictionaries and a sparsity prior to separate distinct sources in signals, by
introducing our novel eigenspace clustering technique to obtain data-driven MCA
dictionaries, which we call dynamic morphological component analysis (DMCA).
After deriving our novel algorithm, we offer a motivational example of DMCA
applied to a still image, then demonstrate DMCA's effectiveness in denoising
applications on videos from the Adobe 240fps dataset. Afterwards, we provide an
example of DMCA enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of a faint target summed
with a sea state, and conclude the paper by applying DMCA to separate a bicycle
from wind clutter in inverse synthetic aperture radar images.

Result: 实验表明攻击后水印恢复率接近零，同时保持图像视觉保真度。

Conclusion: 当前鲁棒水印技术对生成模型攻击存在根本性漏洞，需开发新策略。

Abstract: Robust invisible watermarking aims to embed hidden information into images
such that the watermark can survive various image manipulations. However, the
rise of powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques poses
a new threat to these watermarking schemes. In this paper, we present a
theoretical study and method demonstrating that diffusion models can
effectively break robust image watermarks that were designed to resist
conventional perturbations. We show that a diffusion-driven ``image
regeneration'' process can erase embedded watermarks while preserving
perceptual image content. We further introduce a novel guided diffusion attack
that explicitly targets the watermark signal during generation, significantly
degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image
undergoes sufficient diffusion-based transformation, the mutual information
between the watermarked image and the embedded watermark payload vanishes,
resulting in decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate our approach on
multiple state-of-the-art watermarking schemes (including the deep
learning-based methods StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate
near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual
fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings highlight a fundamental
vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative
model-based attacks, underscoring the need for new watermarking strategies in
the era of generative AI.

Result: 双阶段提示策略提高了模型可靠性，最佳模型平均绝对误差为1.12cm。

Conclusion: 预训练模型无需微调即可补充传统传感器，未来需实现实时图片采集。

Abstract: This study examines the use of social media and news images to detect and
measure hailstones, utilizing pre-trained multimodal large language models. The
dataset for this study comprises 474 crowdsourced images of hailstones from
documented hail events in Austria, which occurred between January 2022 and
September 2024. These hailstones have maximum diameters ranging from 2 to 11cm.
We estimate the hail diameters and compare four different models utilizing
one-stage and two-stage prompting strategies. The latter utilizes additional
size cues from reference objects, such as human hands, within the image. Our
results show that pretrained models already have the potential to measure
hailstone diameters from images with an average mean absolute error of 1.12cm
for the best model. In comparison to a single-stage prompt, two-stage prompting
improves the reliability of most models. Our study suggests that these
off-the-shelf models, even without fine-tuning, can complement traditional hail
sensors by extracting meaningful and spatially dense information from social
media imagery, enabling faster and more detailed assessments of severe weather
events. The automated real-time image harvesting from social media and other
sources remains an open task, but it will make our approach directly applicable
to future hail events.

Abstract: Generating accurate and coherent image captions in a continual learning
setting remains a major challenge due to catastrophic forgetting and the
difficulty of aligning evolving visual concepts with language over time. In
this work, we propose a novel multi-loss framework for continual image
captioning that integrates semantic guidance through prompt-based continual
learning and contrastive alignment. Built upon a pretrained ViT-GPT-2 backbone,
our approach combines standard cross-entropy loss with three additional
components: (1) a prompt-based cosine similarity loss that aligns image
embeddings with synthetically constructed prompts encoding objects, attributes,
and actions; (2) a CLIP-style loss that promotes alignment between image
embeddings and target caption embedding; and (3) a language-guided contrastive
loss that employs a triplet loss to enhance class-level discriminability
between tasks. Notably, our approach introduces no additional overhead at
inference time and requires no prompts during caption generation. We find that
this approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting, while achieving better
semantic caption alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. The code can

Motivation: 研究揭示通用实例搜索模型即使在没有人类数据的数据集上训练，也能意外识别特定个体，引发了对个人数据识别和隐私保护的担忧。

Method: 评估了两种技术防护措施：索引排除和混淆损失，通过实验验证其效果。

Result: 结合这两种方法可将人员重新识别准确率降至2%以下，同时保持82%的非人物体检索性能，但也发现防护措施存在漏洞。

Conclusion: 研究强调了AI治理与数据保护交叉领域的紧迫监管问题，包括如何分类和监管具有意外识别能力的系统，以及如何制定技术标准防止此类能力的出现。

Abstract: Generic instance search models can dramatically reduce the manual effort
required to analyze vast surveillance footage during criminal investigations by
retrieving specific objects of interest to law enforcement. However, our
research reveals an unintended emergent capability: through overlearning, these
models can single out specific individuals even when trained on datasets
without human subjects. This capability raises concerns regarding
identification and profiling of individuals based on their personal data, while
there is currently no clear standard on how de-identification can be achieved.
We evaluate two technical safeguards to curtail a model's person
re-identification capacity: index exclusion and confusion loss. Our experiments
demonstrate that combining these approaches can reduce person re-identification
accuracy to below 2% while maintaining 82% of retrieval performance for
non-person objects. However, we identify critical vulnerabilities in these
mitigations, including potential circumvention using partial person images.
These findings highlight urgent regulatory questions at the intersection of AI
governance and data protection: How should we classify and regulate systems
with emergent identification capabilities? And what technical standards should
be required to prevent identification capabilities from developing in seemingly
benign applications?

Motivation: 长视频理解中，均匀采样帧会导致LLMs被大量无关信息淹没，现有方法难以动态适应复杂层次结构并准确定位关键帧。

Method: 提出VideoMiner，迭代分割、描述和聚类长视频，形成层次树结构；引入T-GRPO方法，基于强化学习动态定位关键帧。

Conclusion: VideoMiner和T-GRPO有效解决了长视频理解中的冗余信息干扰和动态适应问题，为多模态LLMs应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding hour-long videos with multi-modal large language models
(MM-LLMs) enriches the landscape of human-centered AI applications. However,
for end-to-end video understanding with LLMs, uniformly sampling video frames
results in LLMs being overwhelmed by a vast amount of irrelevant information as
video length increases. Existing hierarchical key frame extraction methods
improve the accuracy of video understanding but still face two critical
challenges. 1) How can the interference of extensive redundant information in
long videos be mitigated? 2) How can a model dynamically adapt to complex
hierarchical structures while accurately identifying key frames? To address
these issues, we propose VideoMiner, which iteratively segments, captions, and
clusters long videos, forming a hierarchical tree structure. The proposed
VideoMiner progresses from long videos to events to frames while preserving
temporal coherence, effectively addressing the first challenge. To precisely
locate key frames, we introduce T-GRPO, a tree-based group relative policy
optimization in reinforcement learning method that guides the exploration of
the VideoMiner. The proposed T-GRPO is specifically designed for tree
structures, integrating spatiotemporal information at the event level while
being guided by the question, thus solving the second challenge. We achieve
superior performance in all long-video understanding tasks and uncover several
interesting insights. Our proposed T-GRPO surprisingly incentivizes the model
to spontaneously generate a reasoning chain. Additionally, the designed tree
growth auxin dynamically adjusts the expansion depth, obtaining accuracy and
efficiency gains. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Existing 3D face modeling methods usually depend on 3D Morphable Models,

Optimization-based approaches offer high-quality reconstructions but tend to be
computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce GLVD, a hybrid method for
3D face reconstruction from few-shot images that extends Learned Vertex Descent
(LVD) by integrating per-vertex neural field optimization with global
structural guidance from dynamically predicted 3D keypoints. By incorporating
relative spatial encoding, GLVD iteratively refines mesh vertices without
requiring dense 3D supervision. This enables expressive and adaptable geometry
reconstruction while maintaining computational efficiency. GLVD achieves
state-of-the-art performance in single-view settings and remains highly
competitive in multi-view scenarios, all while substantially reducing inference

Motivation: 视觉观察下的机器人腹腔镜手术任务面临高维输入、奖励稀疏和特征提取困难等挑战，需要一种更高效的方法。

Method: 通过将医学领域专用的Vision-Language模型MedFlamingo与PPO结合，利用每回合生成的高层规划令牌，结合医学专业知识和实时视觉反馈。

Result: 在LapGym的五个任务环境中，MedFlamingo PPO的表现优于标准视觉PPO和OpenFlamingo PPO，任务成功率超过70%，提升幅度达66.67%至1114.29%。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合医学专业知识的视觉语言模型能显著提升机器人手术规划和决策的效率。

Abstract: Vision-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) struggles with visual
observation-based robotic laparoscopic surgical tasks due to the
high-dimensional nature of visual input, the sparsity of rewards in surgical
environments, and the difficulty of extracting task-relevant features from raw
visual data. We introduce a simple approach integrating MedFlamingo, a medical
domain-specific Vision-Language Model, with PPO. Our method is evaluated on
five diverse laparoscopic surgery task environments in LapGym, using only
endoscopic visual observations. MedFlamingo PPO outperforms and converges
faster compared to both standard vision-based PPO and OpenFlamingo PPO
baselines, achieving task success rates exceeding 70% across all environments,
with improvements ranging from 66.67% to 1114.29% compared to baseline. By
processing task observations and instructions once per episode to generate
high-level planning tokens, our method efficiently combines medical expertise
with real-time visual feedback. Our results highlight the value of specialized
medical knowledge in robotic surgical planning and decision-making.

TL;DR: CAPTCHA-X是一个新的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，通过逐步推理显著提升解决CAPTCHA的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前商业视觉语言模型在解决高难度空间推理任务（如CAPTCHA）时表现不佳，需要研究推理能力的重要性。

Method: 引入CAPTCHA-X基准测试，提出基于代理的视觉语言模型框架，结合逐步推理提升性能。

Result: 该方法在五种高难度CAPTCHA类型中平均准确率达到83.9%，显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 研究表明推理能力对解决视觉空间挑战至关重要，当前模型存在局限性。

Abstract: CAPTCHA, originally designed to distinguish humans from robots, has evolved
into a real-world benchmark for assessing the spatial reasoning capabilities of
vision-language models. In this work, we first show that step-by-step reasoning
is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs) to solve CAPTCHAs, which represent
high-difficulty spatial reasoning tasks, and that current commercial
vision-language models still struggle with such reasoning. In particular, we
observe that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to
effectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).
However, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step
reasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its
solving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study
this issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with
reasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,
etc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further
define five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation
of models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,
we also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the
models inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving
accuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines. These
results reveal the limitations of current models and highlight the importance
of reasoning in advancing visual-spatial challenges in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合注意力机制与统计过滤的方法，为Vision Transformers生成更忠实和可解释的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ViT解释方法依赖注意力权重，但结果噪声较多；需要更有效的解释方法。

Method: 结合注意力图与统计过滤，去除噪声模式，并扩展为类特定变体。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于或与SOTA方法相当，生成更清晰、更可解释的映射。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且符合人类感知，强调人类可解释性对XAI的重要性。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) has become increasingly important with the rise of large
transformer models, yet many explanation methods designed for CNNs transfer
poorly to Vision Transformers (ViTs). Existing ViT explanations often rely on
attention weights, which tend to yield noisy maps as they capture
token-to-token interactions within each layer.While attribution methods
incorporating MLP blocks have been proposed, we argue that attention remains a
valuable and interpretable signal when properly filtered. We propose a method
that combines attention maps with a statistical filtering, initially proposed
for CNNs, to remove noisy or uninformative patterns and produce more faithful
explanations. We further extend our approach with a class-specific variant that
yields discriminative explanations. Evaluation against popular state-of-the-art
methods demonstrates that our approach produces sharper and more interpretable
maps. In addition to perturbation-based faithfulness metrics, we incorporate
human gaze data to assess alignment with human perception, arguing that human
interpretability remains essential for XAI. Across multiple datasets, our
approach consistently outperforms or is comparable to the SOTA methods while
remaining efficient and human plausible.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频推理中CoT机制常导致性能下降，产生误导性内部独白（视觉思维漂移），需开发更可靠的推理方法。

Method: 提出VER框架，通过强化学习奖励基于视觉证据的推理轨迹。

Result: 在10个视频理解基准测试中，Video-VER表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视频推理的独特挑战，推动AI在推理时更注重视觉证据，实现“边看边思考”。

Abstract: Video reasoning, the task of enabling machines to infer from dynamic visual
content through multi-step logic, is crucial for advanced AI. While the
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism has enhanced reasoning in text-based tasks,
its application to video understanding remains underexplored. This paper
presents a systematic analysis revealing that CoT often degrades performance in
video reasoning, generating verbose but misleading internal monologues, and
leading to hallucinated visual details and overridden correct intuitions - a
phenomenon we term "visual thinking drift". We explain this drift through a
Bayesian lens, positing that CoT traces often diverge from actual visual
evidence, instead amplifying internal biases or language priors, causing models
to storytell rather than engage in grounded reasoning. To counteract this, we
introduce Visual Evidence Reward (VER), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that explicitly rewards the generation of reasoning traces that are
verifiably grounded in visual evidence. Comprehensive evaluation across 10
diverse video understanding benchmarks demonstrates that our Video-VER
consistently achieves top performance. Our work sheds light on the distinct
challenges of video-centric reasoning and encourages the development of AI that
robustly grounds its inferences in visual evidence - for large multimodal
models that not only "think before answering", but also "see while thinking".

Motivation: 尽管现有分割框架（如TotalSegmentator）已取得一定成功，但左心耳、冠状动脉和肺静脉的精确分割仍是医学影像中的挑战。

Method: 使用专门开发的高分辨率分割框架生成左心耳分割，并在大型私有数据集上训练模型；冠状动脉和肺静脉的分割则通过改进现有标注实现。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在促进左心耳形态分析的新方法研究。

Abstract: Despite the success of advanced segmentation frameworks such as
TotalSegmentator (TS), accurate segmentations of the left atrial appendage
(LAA), coronary arteries (CAs), and pulmonary veins (PVs) remain a significant
challenge in medical imaging. In this work, we present the first open-source,
anatomically coherent dataset of curated, high-resolution segmentations for
these structures, supplemented with whole-heart labels produced by TS on the
publicly available ImageCAS dataset consisting of 1000 cardiac computed
tomography angiography (CCTA) scans. One purpose of the data set is to foster
novel approaches to the analysis of LAA morphology.
  LAA segmentations on ImageCAS were generated using a state-of-the-art
segmentation framework developed specifically for high resolution LAA
segmentation. We trained the network on a large private dataset with manual
annotations provided by medical readers guided by a trained cardiologist and
transferred the model to ImageCAS data. CA labels were improved from the
original ImageCAS annotations, while PV segmentations were refined from TS
outputs. In addition, we provide a list of scans from ImageCAS that contains
common data flaws such as step artefacts, LAAs extending beyond the scanner's
field of view, and other types of data defects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量模型只能利用一两个先验，难以平衡权重和优化多块结构，因此需要一种能同时整合多级先验的模型。

Conclusion: 提出的模型能有效整合多级先验，提升高光谱图像超分辨率性能。

Abstract: Fusing a hyperspectral image with a multispectral image acquired over the
same scene, \textit{i.e.}, hyperspectral image super-resolution, has become a
popular computational way to access the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution
image. To date, a variety of fusion methods have been proposed, among which the
tensor-based ones have testified that multiple priors, such as multidimensional
low-rankness and spatial total variation at multiple levels, effectively drive
the fusion process. However, existing tensor-based models can only effectively
leverage one or two priors at one or two levels, since simultaneously
incorporating multi-level priors inevitably increases model complexity. This
introduces challenges in both balancing the weights of different priors and
optimizing multi-block structures. Concerning this, we present a novel
hyperspectral super-resolution model compactly characterizing these multi-level
priors of hyperspectral images within the tensor framework. Firstly, the
proposed model decouples the spectral low-rankness and spatial priors by
casting the latent high-spatial-spectral-resolution image into spectral
subspace and spatial maps via block term decomposition. Secondly, these spatial
maps are stacked as the spatial tensor encoding the high-order spatial
low-rankness and smoothness priors, which are co-modeled via the proposed
non-convex mode-shuffled tensor correlated total variation. Finally, we draw
inspiration from the linearized alternating direction method of multipliers to
design an efficient algorithm to optimize the resulting model, theoretically
proving its Karush-Kuhn-Tucker convergence under mild conditions. Experiments
on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Motivation: 当前生存分析模型难以解释，传统原型学习方法忽视肿瘤整体背景和基因组数据的语义对齐。

Method: FeatProto建立统一特征原型空间，结合EMA ProtoUp策略和分层原型匹配方案。

Result: 在四个公开癌症数据集上，FeatProto在准确性和互操作性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FeatProto为原型学习在医学应用提供了新视角，代码已开源。

Abstract: Survival analysis plays a vital role in making clinical decisions. However,
the models currently in use are often difficult to interpret, which reduces
their usefulness in clinical settings. Prototype learning presents a potential
solution, yet traditional methods focus on local similarities and static
matching, neglecting the broader tumor context and lacking strong semantic
alignment with genomic data. To overcome these issues, we introduce an
innovative prototype-based multimodal framework, FeatProto, aimed at enhancing
cancer survival prediction by addressing significant limitations in current
prototype learning methodologies within pathology. Our framework establishes a
unified feature prototype space that integrates both global and local features
of whole slide images (WSI) with genomic profiles. This integration facilitates
traceable and interpretable decision-making processes. Our approach includes
three main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges
critical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize
local bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that
sustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to
adapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype
matching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and
cohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive
evaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method
surpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction
techniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective
on prototype learning for critical medical applications. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/JSLiam94/FeatProto.

Abstract: Deep learning in medical imaging is often limited by scarce and imbalanced
annotated data. We present SSGNet, a unified framework that combines class
specific generative modeling with iterative semisupervised pseudo labeling to
enhance both classification and segmentation. Rather than functioning as a
standalone model, SSGNet augments existing baselines by expanding training data
with StyleGAN3 generated images and refining labels through iterative pseudo
labeling. Experiments across multiple medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate
consistent gains in classification and segmentation performance, while Frechet
Inception Distance analysis confirms the high quality of generated samples.
These results highlight SSGNet as a practical strategy to mitigate annotation
bottlenecks and improve robustness in medical image analysis.

Motivation: 现有生成医学模型受限于模态特定场景，无法整合多模态数据，限制了其发展为跨模态基础模型的能力。

Method: MeDiM基于离散扩散框架，利用多模态大语言模型（MLLM）作为扩散主干，引入双向上下文和无因果注意力掩码设计。

Result: 实验显示MeDiM在医学图像和报告生成任务中表现优异（FID和METEOR指标突出），联合生成进一步提升了下游任务性能。

Conclusion: MeDiM通过统一多模态生成任务，支持临床一致的多模态输出，为医学生成模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by
modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary
evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits
their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the
full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete
diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without
modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks:
translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs
across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework,
MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared
probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we
employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone,
leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are
introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context,
and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness.
Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on
MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR
0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance
downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2,
plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports
coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs.

Motivation: 现有方法将RVOS分解为‘定位-分割’流程，导致语义信息简化和时间一致性不足。FlowRVS旨在克服这些限制。

Method: FlowRVS将RVOS建模为条件连续流问题，利用预训练的T2V模型实现细粒度像素控制和语义对齐。

Conclusion: 将视频理解任务建模为连续变形过程具有显著潜力。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting specific
objects in a video guided by a natural language description. The core challenge
of RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels
and continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video. Faced
with this difficulty, prior work has often decomposed the task into a pragmatic
`locate-then-segment' pipeline. However, this cascaded design creates an
information bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts
(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting
process is often decoupled from the initial language grounding. To overcome
these fundamental limitations, we propose FlowRVS, a novel framework that
reconceptualizes RVOS as a conditional continuous flow problem. This allows us
to harness the inherent strengths of pretrained T2V models, fine-grained pixel
control, text-video semantic alignment, and temporal coherence. Instead of
conventional generating from noise to mask or directly predicting mask, we
reformulate the task by learning a direct, language-guided deformation from a
video's holistic representation to its target mask. Our one-stage, generative
approach achieves new state-of-the-art results across all major RVOS
benchmarks. Specifically, achieving a $\mathcal{J}\&\mathcal{F}$ of 51.1 in
MeViS (+1.6 over prior SOTA) and 73.3 in the zero shot Ref-DAVIS17 (+2.7),
demonstrating the significant potential of modeling video understanding tasks
as continuous deformation processes.

Abstract: Video-conditioned 4D shape generation aims to recover time-varying 3D
geometry and view-consistent appearance directly from an input video. In this
work, we introduce a native video-to-4D shape generation framework that
synthesizes a single dynamic 3D representation end-to-end from the video. Our
framework introduces three key components based on large-scale pre-trained 3D
models: (i) a temporal attention that conditions generation on all frames while
producing a time-indexed dynamic representation; (ii) a time-aware point
sampling and 4D latent anchoring that promote temporally consistent geometry
and texture; and (iii) noise sharing across frames to enhance temporal
stability. Our method accurately captures non-rigid motion, volume changes, and
even topological transitions without per-frame optimization. Across diverse
in-the-wild videos, our method improves robustness and perceptual fidelity and
reduces failure modes compared with the baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have sparked exciting new possibilities
in the field of autonomous vehicles. Specifically, video generation models are
now being explored as controllable virtual testing environments.
Simultaneously, end-to-end (E2E) driving models have emerged as a streamlined
alternative to conventional modular autonomous driving systems, gaining
popularity for their simplicity and scalability. However, the application of
these techniques to simulation and planning raises important questions. First,
while video generation models can generate increasingly realistic videos, can
these videos faithfully adhere to the specified conditions and be realistic
enough for E2E autonomous planner evaluation? Second, given that data is
crucial for understanding and controlling E2E planners, how can we gain deeper
insights into their biases and improve their ability to generalize to
out-of-distribution scenarios? In this work, we bridge the gap between the
driving models and generative world models (Drive&Gen) to address these
questions. We propose novel statistical measures leveraging E2E drivers to
evaluate the realism of generated videos. By exploiting the controllability of
the video generation model, we conduct targeted experiments to investigate
distribution gaps affecting E2E planner performance. Finally, we show that
synthetic data produced by the video generation model offers a cost-effective
alternative to real-world data collection. This synthetic data effectively
improves E2E model generalization beyond existing Operational Design Domains,
facilitating the expansion of autonomous vehicle services into new operational
contexts.

Abstract: Current text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating diverse,
high-quality images, yet they struggle to incorporate fine-grained camera
metadata such as precise aperture settings. In this work, we introduce a novel
text-to-image diffusion framework that leverages camera metadata, or EXIF data,
which is often embedded in image files, with an emphasis on generating
controllable lens blur. Our method mimics the physical image formation process
by first generating an all-in-focus image, estimating its monocular depth,
predicting a plausible focus distance with a novel focus distance transformer,
and then forming a defocused image with an existing differentiable lens blur
model. Gradients flow backwards through this whole process, allowing us to
learn without explicit supervision to generate defocus effects based on content
elements and the provided EXIF data. At inference time, this enables precise
interactive user control over defocus effects while preserving scene contents,
which is not achievable with existing diffusion models. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model enables superior fine-grained control without
altering the depicted scene.

Abstract: Most existing benchmarks for egocentric vision understanding focus primarily
on daytime scenarios, overlooking the low-light conditions that are inevitable
in real-world applications. To investigate this gap, we present EgoNight, the
first comprehensive benchmark for nighttime egocentric vision, with visual
question answering (VQA) as the core task. A key feature of EgoNight is the
introduction of day-night aligned videos, which enhance night annotation
quality using the daytime data and reveal clear performance gaps between
lighting conditions. To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered
by Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are
visually and temporally aligned. Leveraging these paired videos, we construct
EgoNight-VQA, supported by a novel day-augmented night auto-labeling engine and
refinement through extensive human verification. Each QA pair is double-checked
by annotators for reliability. In total, EgoNight-VQA contains 3658 QA pairs
across 90 videos, spanning 12 diverse QA types, with more than 300 hours of
human work. Evaluations of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) reveal substantial performance drops when transferring from day to
night, underscoring the challenges of reasoning under low-light conditions.
Beyond VQA, EgoNight also introduces two auxiliary tasks, day-night
correspondence retrieval and egocentric depth estimation at night, that further
explore the boundaries of existing models. We believe EgoNight-VQA provides a
strong foundation for advancing application-driven egocentric vision research
and for developing models that generalize across illumination domains. All the
data and code will be made available upon acceptance.

*Yue Chen,Xingyu Chen,Yuxuan Xue,Anpei Chen,Yuliang Xiu,Gerard Pons-Moll*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Human3R是一个统一的、前馈的框架，用于从单目视频中实时重建4D人类场景，无需多阶段处理或依赖外部模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖多阶段流程和外部预处理（如人体检测、深度估计和SLAM），导致效率低下且复杂。Human3R旨在通过统一模型简化流程，实现高效、实时的重建。

Method: 基于CUT3R模型，采用参数高效的视觉提示调优，联合恢复全局多人SMPL-X身体、密集3D场景和相机轨迹，单次前向传播完成。

Result: 在BEDLAM数据集上训练一天后，Human3R能以15 FPS实时运行，内存占用低（8 GB），在多项任务中达到SOTA或竞争性性能。

Conclusion: Human3R是一个简单高效的基线模型，可轻松扩展至下游应用，为4D人类场景重建提供了新标准。

Abstract: We present Human3R, a unified, feed-forward framework for online 4D
human-scene reconstruction, in the world frame, from casually captured
monocular videos. Unlike previous approaches that rely on multi-stage
pipelines, iterative contact-aware refinement between humans and scenes, and
heavy dependencies, e.g., human detection, depth estimation, and SLAM
pre-processing, Human3R jointly recovers global multi-person SMPL-X bodies
("everyone"), dense 3D scene ("everywhere"), and camera trajectories in a
single forward pass ("all-at-once"). Our method builds upon the 4D online
reconstruction model CUT3R, and uses parameter-efficient visual prompt tuning,
to strive to preserve CUT3R's rich spatiotemporal priors, while enabling direct
readout of multiple SMPL-X bodies. Human3R is a unified model that eliminates
heavy dependencies and iterative refinement. After being trained on the
relatively small-scale synthetic dataset BEDLAM for just one day on one GPU, it
achieves superior performance with remarkable efficiency: it reconstructs
multiple humans in a one-shot manner, along with 3D scenes, in one stage, at
real-time speed (15 FPS) with a low memory footprint (8 GB). Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Human3R delivers state-of-the-art or competitive
performance across tasks, including global human motion estimation, local human
mesh recovery, video depth estimation, and camera pose estimation, with a
single unified model. We hope that Human3R will serve as a simple yet strong
baseline, be easily extended for downstream applications.Code available in

### [75] [Synthetic History: Evaluating Visual Representations of the Past in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17064)
*Maria-Teresa De Rosa Palmini,Eva Cetinic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估文本到图像（TTI）模型历史表现的系统方法，揭示了模型在历史图像生成中的系统性不准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索TTI模型在历史背景下的表现，填补了现有研究对历史准确性评估的空白。

Method: 方法包括创建HistVis数据集（30,000张合成图像），并从隐含风格关联、历史一致性和人口统计表现三个方面进行评估。

Result: 结果显示TTI模型在历史图像生成中存在刻板印象、时代错误和人口统计不准确等问题。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法为构建更准确的历史和文化对齐TTI模型提供了初步步骤。

Abstract: As Text-to-Image (TTI) diffusion models become increasingly influential in
content creation, growing attention is being directed toward their societal and
cultural implications. While prior research has primarily examined demographic
and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent
historical contexts remains largely underexplored. In this work, we present a
systematic and reproducible methodology for evaluating how TTI systems depict
different historical periods. For this purpose, we introduce the HistVis
dataset, a curated collection of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three
state-of-the-art diffusion models using carefully designed prompts depicting
universal human activities across different historical periods. We evaluate
generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic
Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras;
(2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts
in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated
racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our
findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated
imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating
unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible
demographic patterns. By offering a scalable methodology and benchmark for
assessing historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an
initial step toward building more historically accurate and culturally aligned
TTI models.

*Farjana Yesmin,Nusrat Shirmin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类的新框架，提升大数据环境中的可解释性和公平性，在UCI空气质量数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒模型缺乏透明度，后处理XAI技术常牺牲准确性或无法提供内在洞察，需改进。

Method: 结合类型2模糊集、粒计算和聚类，引入公平性度量，生成语言规则，评估效率。

Result: 类型2模糊聚类比类型1方法提升4%内聚性（轮廓分数0.365 vs. 0.349），公平性熵0.918，规则覆盖率达0.65。

Conclusion: 新框架在可解释性、公平性和效率上优于基线方法，适用于大数据环境。

Abstract: The growing complexity of machine learning (ML) models in big data analytics,
especially in domains such as environmental monitoring, highlights the critical
need for interpretability and explainability to promote trust, ethical
considerations, and regulatory adherence (e.g., GDPR). Traditional "black-box"
models obstruct transparency, whereas post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) techniques
like LIME and SHAP frequently compromise accuracy or fail to deliver inherent
insights. This paper presents a novel framework that combines type-2 fuzzy
sets, granular computing, and clustering to boost explainability and fairness
in big data environments. When applied to the UCI Air Quality dataset, the
framework effectively manages uncertainty in noisy sensor data, produces
linguistic rules, and assesses fairness using silhouette scores and entropy.
Key contributions encompass: (1) A type-2 fuzzy clustering approach that
enhances cohesion by about 4% compared to type-1 methods (silhouette 0.365 vs.
0.349) and improves fairness (entropy 0.918); (2) Incorporation of fairness
measures to mitigate biases in unsupervised scenarios; (3) A rule-based
component for intrinsic XAI, achieving an average coverage of 0.65; (4)
Scalable assessments showing linear runtime (roughly 0.005 seconds for sampled
big data sizes). Experimental outcomes reveal superior performance relative to
baselines such as DBSCAN and Agglomerative Clustering in terms of
interpretability, fairness, and efficiency. Notably, the proposed method
achieves a 4% improvement in silhouette score over type-1 fuzzy clustering and
outperforms baselines in fairness (entropy reduction by up to 1%) and
efficiency.

Motivation: 研究Transformer模型在金融决策中对波动性数据的依赖及其预测置信度的影响。

Method: 使用Transformer模型预测，并引入基于部分信息分解（PID）的度量方法。

Result: 模型完全忽视数据波动性，且偏向低频价格数据。

Conclusion: 揭示了Transformer模型在金融应用中的潜在风险和偏见。

Abstract: Transformer models have become increasingly popular in financial
applications, yet their potential risk making and biases remain under-explored.
The purpose of this work is to audit the reliance of the model on volatile data
for decision-making, and quantify how the frequency of price movements affects
the model's prediction confidence. We employ a transformer model for
prediction, and introduce a metric based on Partial Information Decomposition
(PID) to measure the influence of each asset on the model's decision making.
Our analysis reveals two key observations: first, the model disregards data
volatility entirely, and second, it is biased toward data with lower-frequency
price movements.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索对抗性强化学习在网络安全中的实际应用，特别是针对多端口服务的暴力攻击和反应性防御。

Method: 使用Deep Q-Networks (DQN)在零和奖励框架下训练攻击者和防御者代理，环境模拟了真实的网络安全权衡。

Result: 实验表明，防御者的可观测性和陷阱有效性对攻击成功构成显著障碍，且奖励塑造和训练调度对学习稳定性至关重要。

Conclusion: 该环境为零和研究提供了实用工具，适用于研究自主防御系统、攻击者-防御者共同进化以及现实网络安全场景的迁移学习。

Abstract: This paper presents a controlled study of adversarial reinforcement learning
in network security through a custom OpenAI Gym environment that models
brute-force attacks and reactive defenses on multi-port services. The
environment captures realistic security trade-offs including background traffic
noise, progressive exploitation mechanics, IP-based evasion tactics, honeypot
traps, and multi-level rate-limiting defenses. Competing attacker and defender
agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks (DQN) within a zero-sum reward
framework, where successful exploits yield large terminal rewards while
incremental actions incur small costs. Through systematic evaluation across
multiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation
difficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that
defender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to
successful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful
training scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial
setting. The defender consistently maintains strategic advantage across 50,000+
training episodes, with performance gains amplifying when exposed to complex
defensive strategies including adaptive IP blocking and port-specific controls.
Complete implementation details, reproducible hyperparameter configurations,
and architectural guidelines are provided to support future research in
adversarial RL for cybersecurity. The zero-sum formulation and realistic
operational constraints make this environment suitable for studying autonomous
defense systems, attacker-defender co-evolution, and transfer learning to
real-world network security scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于代理的优化（SBO）方法只能收敛到单点解，限制了设计空间的探索和潜在有价值拓扑的发现。

Method: 使用CVAE学习设计参数与性能之间的概率映射，生成多样化的高性能候选方案。

Result: 在降低翼型自噪声的实验中，CVAE生成了256个新设计，其中94.1%有效，77.2%优于SBO基准的单点解。

Conclusion: 生成式方法不仅能发现更高质量的解，还提供了多样化的候选方案，增强了工程设计的决策能力。

Abstract: Inverse design, which seeks to find optimal parameters for a target output,
is a central challenge in engineering. Surrogate-based optimization (SBO) has
become a standard approach, yet it is fundamentally structured to converge to a
single-point solution, thereby limiting design space exploration and ignoring
potentially valuable alternative topologies. This paper presents a paradigm
shift from single-point optimization to generative inverse design. We introduce
a framework based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) that learns a
probabilistic mapping between a system's design parameters and its performance,
enabling the generation of a diverse portfolio of high-performing candidates
conditioned on a specific performance objective. We apply this methodology to
the complex, non-linear problem of minimizing airfoil self-noise, using a
high-performing SBO method from a prior benchmark study as a rigorous baseline.
The CVAE framework successfully generated 256 novel designs with a 94.1\%
validity rate. A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\% of
these valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single
optimal design found by the SBO baseline. This work demonstrates that the
generative approach not only discovers higher-quality solutions but also
provides a rich portfolio of diverse candidates, fundamentally enhancing the
engineering design process by enabling multi-criteria decision-making.

Motivation: 研究旨在评估机器学习在数字银行欺诈检测中的有效性，并识别当前的技术趋势和挑战。

Method: 遵循PRISMA指南，采用结构化流程（识别、筛选、资格评估和纳入）确保方法严谨性和透明度。

Result: 监督学习方法（如决策树、逻辑回归）仍占主导，无监督异常检测和深度学习（如RNN、CNN）逐渐兴起，混合模型表现最佳。

Conclusion: 混合模型结合多种学习策略，展现出更高的适应性和检测准确性，是未来发展的潜在方向。

Abstract: This systematic literature review examines the role of machine learning in
fraud detection within digital banking, synthesizing evidence from 118
peer-reviewed studies and institutional reports. Following the PRISMA
guidelines, the review applied a structured identification, screening,
eligibility, and inclusion process to ensure methodological rigor and
transparency. The findings reveal that supervised learning methods, such as
decision trees, logistic regression, and support vector machines, remain the
dominant paradigm due to their interpretability and established performance,
while unsupervised anomaly detection approaches are increasingly adopted to
address novel fraud patterns in highly imbalanced datasets. Deep learning
architectures, particularly recurrent and convolutional neural networks, have
emerged as transformative tools capable of modeling sequential transaction data
and detecting complex fraud typologies, though challenges of interpretability
and real-time deployment persist. Hybrid models that combine supervised,
unsupervised, and deep learning strategies demonstrate superior adaptability
and detection accuracy, highlighting their potential as convergent solutions.

Motivation: LIF神经元模型虽然计算高效但表达能力有限，而QIF模型具有更丰富的非线性动态但训练不稳定。

Method: 提出QIF神经元模型的离散化方法，并通过分析动态特性推导出替代梯度窗口的解析公式以确保训练稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet和CIFAR-10 DVS数据集上表现优于现有LIF方法。

Conclusion: QIF离散化模型为深度SNNs提供了一种兼具丰富动态和实用可扩展性的替代方案。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as energy-efficient alternatives
to traditional artificial neural networks, leveraging asynchronous and
biologically inspired neuron dynamics. Among existing neuron models, the Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to
its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, this efficiency comes at
the expense of expressiveness, as LIF dynamics are constrained to linear decay
at each timestep. In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic
Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have
seen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we
propose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for
high-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis
of its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical
formulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'
parameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch. We evaluate our method on
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR-10 DVS, demonstrating its ability to
outperform state-of-the-art LIF-based methods. These results establish our
discretization of the QIF neuron as a compelling alternative to LIF neurons for
deep SNNs, combining richer dynamics with practical scalability.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索新质生产力、数字经济与人工智能技术对可持续城市发展的影响，特别是对碳排放的预测与解释。

Method: 采用MADCN框架，结合特征交互建模和注意力机制，并利用SHAP进行可解释性分析，基于中国275个城市的面板数据。

Result: MADCN模型在测试集上表现优异（MSE=406,151.063，MAE=612.304，R²=0.991），SHAP分析显示人口、城市规模等技术因素对碳排放有显著影响。

Conclusion: 推动新质生产力、数字经济和AI技术发展可有效减少碳排放，政策制定者应优先将技术创新整合到碳减排策略中。

Abstract: New quality productive forces (NQPF), digital economy advancement, and
artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are becoming crucial for promoting
sustainable urban development. This study proposes a Multi-head Attention Deep
& Cross Network (MADCN) framework, combining feature interaction modeling and
attention mechanisms, to predict urban carbon emissions and investigate the
impacts of technological factors. The framework incorporates an interpretable
learning phase using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to assess the
contributions of different features. A panel dataset covering 275 Chinese
cities is utilized to test the MADCN model. Experimental results demonstrate
that the MADCN model achieves superior predictive performance compared to
traditional machine learning and deep learning baselines, with a Mean Squared
Error (MSE) of 406,151.063, a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 612.304, and an
R-squared value of 0.991 on the test set. SHAP analysis highlights that
population, city size, urbanization rate, and GDP are among the most
influential factors on carbon emissions, while NQPF, digital economy index, and
AI technology level also show meaningful but relatively moderate effects.
Advancing NQPF, strengthening the digital economy, and accelerating AI
technology development can significantly contribute to reducing urban carbon
emissions. Policymakers should prioritize integrating technological innovation
into carbon reduction strategies, particularly by promoting intelligent
infrastructure and enhancing digitalization across sectors, to effectively
achieve dual-carbon goals.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习从隐私友好数据中学习丰富表示，显著提升了电池容量估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate battery capacity estimation is key to alleviating consumer concerns
about battery performance and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs). However,
practical data limitations imposed by stringent privacy regulations and labeled
data shortages hamper the development of generalizable capacity estimation
models that remain robust to real-world data distribution shifts. While
self-supervised learning can leverage unlabeled data, existing techniques are
not particularly designed to learn effectively from challenging field data --
let alone from privacy-friendly data, which are often less feature-rich and
noisier. In this work, we propose a first-of-its-kind capacity estimation model
based on self-supervised pre-training, developed on a large-scale dataset of
privacy-friendly charging data snippets from real-world EV operations. Our
pre-training framework, snippet similarity-weighted masked input
reconstruction, is designed to learn rich, generalizable representations even
from less feature-rich and fragmented privacy-friendly data. Our key innovation
lies in harnessing contrastive learning to first capture high-level
similarities among fragmented snippets that otherwise lack meaningful context.
With our snippet-wise contrastive learning and subsequent similarity-weighted
masked reconstruction, we are able to learn rich representations of both
granular charging patterns within individual snippets and high-level
associative relationships across different snippets. Bolstered by this rich
representation learning, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, achieving 31.9% lower test error than the best-performing benchmark,
even under challenging domain-shifted settings affected by both manufacturer
and age-induced distribution shifts.

of matrix multiplications where either one operand or the output matrix is
upper- or lower-triangular. This includes all operations in forward and
backward pass of Causal Attention, such as masked product

noticeable accelerations over the default PyTorch implementations and Triton
compiled kernels. FCA is built upon algebraic identities discovered via machine
learning and combinatorial search.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在自回归LLMs中成为内存和带宽瓶颈，现有量化方法无法有效解决分布不平坦问题。

Method: 提出PatternKV，利用K缓存的稳定结构和V缓存的语义规律，在线挖掘模式向量并对齐残差量化。

Result: 在长上下文和测试时扩展场景下，PatternKV实现2比特增益，4比特量化仅损失0.08%，吞吐提升1.4倍。

Conclusion: PatternKV通过重塑KV分布，显著提升低比特量化性能，支持更大批次和更高精度。

Abstract: KV cache in autoregressive LLMs eliminates redundant recomputation but has
emerged as the dominant memory and bandwidth bottleneck during inference,
notably with long contexts and test-time scaling. KV quantization is a key
lever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV
distribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior
work focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten
the overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.
In this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that
evolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic
regularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a
pattern-aligned residual quantization scheme. It mines representative pattern
vectors online, aligns each KV vector to its nearest pattern, and quantizes
only the residual. This reshaping of the KV distribution flattens the
quantization target and narrows its range, thereby improving the fidelity of
low-bit KV quantization. Across long-context and test-time scaling settings on
multiple backbones, PatternKV delivers consistent 2-bit gains, with a 0.08%
average 4-bit drop relative to FP16, improves test-time scaling accuracy by 10%
on average, and raises throughput by 1.4x while supporting 1.25x larger
batches.

Method: 提出了logistic-gated operators (LGO)，这是一种可学习的门控机制，嵌入为类型化原语并映射回物理单位以进行审计。

Result: 在两个健康数据集（ICU和NHANES）上，LGO的硬门控变体恢复了临床可解释的阈值，且使用更少的门控数量，同时保持了与基线相当的准确性。

Conclusion: LGO方法为符号回归提供了一种实用的机制，能够生成紧凑且可审计的符号方程，增强了模型的解释性和部署能力。

Abstract: Symbolic regression promises readable equations but struggles to encode
unit-aware thresholds and conditional logic. We propose logistic-gated
operators (LGO) -- differentiable gates with learnable location and steepness
-- embedded as typed primitives and mapped back to physical units for audit.
Across two primary health datasets (ICU, NHANES), the hard-gate variant
recovers clinically plausible cut-points: 71% (5/7) of assessed thresholds fall
within 10% of guideline anchors and 100% within 20%, while using far fewer
gates than the soft variant (ICU median 4.0 vs 10.0; NHANES 5.0 vs 12.5), and
remaining within the competitive accuracy envelope of strong SR baselines. On
predominantly smooth tasks, gates are pruned, preserving parsimony. The result
is compact symbolic equations with explicit, unit-aware thresholds that can be
audited against clinical anchors -- turning interpretability from a post-hoc
explanation into a modeling constraint and equipping symbolic regression with a
practical calculus for regime switching and governance-ready deployment.

Result: 在TON_IoT、X-IIoTID和IDSIoT2024数据集上的实验表明，OptiFLIDS在保持检测性能的同时显著提升能效。

Conclusion: OptiFLIDS适合实际IoT环境部署，解决了联邦学习在IDS中的关键挑战。

Abstract: In critical IoT environments, such as smart homes and industrial systems,
effective Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are essential for ensuring
security. However, developing robust IDS solutions remains a significant
challenge. Traditional machine learning-based IDS models typically require
large datasets, but data sharing is often limited due to privacy and security
concerns. Federated Learning (FL) presents a promising alternative by enabling
collaborative model training without sharing raw data. Despite its advantages,
FL still faces key challenges, such as data heterogeneity (non-IID data) and
high energy and computation costs, particularly for resource constrained IoT
devices. To address these issues, this paper proposes OptiFLIDS, a novel
approach that applies pruning techniques during local training to reduce model
complexity and energy consumption. It also incorporates a customized
aggregation method to better handle pruned models that differ due to non-IID
data distributions. Experiments conducted on three recent IoT IDS datasets,
TON_IoT, X-IIoTID, and IDSIoT2024, demonstrate that OptiFLIDS maintains strong
detection performance while improving energy efficiency, making it well-suited
for deployment in real-world IoT environments.

Abstract: A common challenge in the natural sciences is to disentangle distinct,
unknown sources from observations. Examples of this source separation task
include deblending galaxies in a crowded field, distinguishing the activity of
individual neurons from overlapping signals, and separating seismic events from
an ambient background. Traditional analyses often rely on simplified source
models that fail to accurately reproduce the data. Recent advances have shown
that diffusion models can directly learn complex prior distributions from
noisy, incomplete data. In this work, we show that diffusion models can solve
the source separation problem without explicit assumptions about the source.
Our method relies only on multiple views, or the property that different sets
of observations contain different linear transformations of the unknown
sources. We show that our method succeeds even when no source is individually
observed and the observations are noisy, incomplete, and vary in resolution.
The learned diffusion models enable us to sample from the source priors,
evaluate the probability of candidate sources, and draw from the joint
posterior of the source distribution given an observation. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on a range of synthetic problems as well as
real-world galaxy observations.

Motivation: 探索权重矩阵的分布表示，特别是高斯性和置换对称性假设下的模型有效性。

Method: 使用13参数置换不变高斯矩阵模型，分析权重矩阵的相关高斯性，并计算Wasserstein距离量化训练过程中的分布变化。

Result: 发现置换不变高斯矩阵模型能有效描述权重矩阵的相关高斯性，且适用于训练过程的不同阶段。

Conclusion: 该模型为权重矩阵分布提供了可解释的框架，并量化了训练过程中的分布变化，为更通用的模型开发提供了基础。

Abstract: Ensembles of neural network weight matrices are studied through the training
process for the MNIST classification problem, testing the efficacy of matrix
models for representing their distributions, under assumptions of Gaussianity
and permutation-symmetry. The general 13-parameter permutation invariant
Gaussian matrix models are found to be effective models for the correlated
Gaussianity in the weight matrices, beyond the range of applicability of the
simple Gaussian with independent identically distributed matrix variables, and
notably well beyond the initialisation step. The representation theoretic model
parameters, and the graph-theoretic characterisation of the permutation
invariant matrix observables give an interpretable framework for the best-fit
model and for small departures from Gaussianity. Additionally, the Wasserstein
distance is calculated for this class of models and used to quantify the
movement of the distributions over training. Throughout the work, the effects
of varied initialisation regimes, regularisation, layer depth, and layer width
are tested for this formalism, identifying limits where particular departures
from Gaussianity are enhanced and how more general, yet still
highly-interpretable, models can be developed.

Motivation: 填补LLMs在高级研究问题（如凝聚态理论）上评估的空白。

Method: 构建包含50个专家级问题的数据集，并通过机器评分和符号处理验证模型答案。

Result: 前沿模型表现不佳，GPT5仅解决30%的问题，平均解决率为11.4%。18个问题未被任何模型解决。

Conclusion: 该基准将推动AI研究助手和导师的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable progress in coding and
math problem-solving, but evaluation on advanced research-level problems in
hard sciences remains scarce. To fill this gap, we present CMT-Benchmark, a
dataset of 50 problems covering condensed matter theory (CMT) at the level of
an expert researcher. Topics span analytical and computational approaches in
quantum many-body, and classical statistical mechanics. The dataset was
designed and verified by a panel of expert researchers from around the world.
We built the dataset through a collaborative environment that challenges the
panel to write and refine problems they would want a research assistant to
solve, including Hartree-Fock, exact diagonalization, quantum/variational Monte
Carlo, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), quantum/classical
statistical mechanics, and model building. We evaluate LLMs by programmatically
checking solutions against expert-supplied ground truth. We developed
machine-grading, including symbolic handling of non-commuting operators via
normal ordering. They generalize across tasks too. Our evaluations show that
frontier models struggle with all of the problems in the dataset, highlighting
a gap in the physical reasoning skills of current LLMs. Notably, experts
identified strategies for creating increasingly difficult problems by
interacting with the LLMs and exploiting common failure modes. The best model,
GPT5, solves 30\% of the problems; average across 17 models (GPT, Gemini,
Claude, DeepSeek, Llama) is 11.4$\pm$2.1\%. Moreover, 18 problems are solved by
none of the 17 models, and 26 by at most one. These unsolved problems span
Quantum Monte Carlo, Variational Monte Carlo, and DMRG. Answers sometimes
violate fundamental symmetries or have unphysical scaling dimensions. We
believe this benchmark will guide development toward capable AI research
assistants and tutors.

TL;DR: 研究了一类参数未知的误设鞍点问题，提出两种基于加速原始对偶（APD）的算法，统一优化与学习，并证明其收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究假设参数已知或预估计，而实际中参数需从数据中学习，因此需要一种统一优化与学习的框架。

Method: 提出两种算法：直接替换参数估计的APD扩展和显式考虑参数动态的学习感知APD变体，后者通过回溯策略自适应选择步长。

Result: 两种算法均达到$\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$收敛率，学习感知变体常数更紧，且在结构化问题中扩展算法达到$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$。

Conclusion: 实验证明方法在误设投资组合优化中优于现有算法，验证了理论优势。

Abstract: We study a class of misspecified saddle point (SP) problems, where the
optimization objective depends on an unknown parameter that must be learned
concurrently from data. Unlike existing studies that assume parameters are
fully known or pre-estimated, our framework integrates optimization and
learning into a unified formulation, enabling a more flexible problem class. To
address this setting, we propose two algorithms based on the accelerated
primal-dual (APD) by Hamedani & Aybat 2021. In particular, we first analyze the
naive extension of the APD method by directly substituting the evolving
parameter estimates into the primal-dual updates; then, we design a new
learning-aware variant of the APD method that explicitly accounts for parameter
dynamics by adjusting the momentum updates. Both methods achieve a provable
convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware
approach attains a tighter $\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from
an adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.
Furthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem
admits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a
structured setting achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ rate. To demonstrate
practical impact, we evaluate our methods on a misspecified portfolio
optimization problem and show superior empirical performance compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算Lipschitz常数是NP难问题，现有方法计算复杂度高且难以利用局部信息。

Method: 开发了广义SDP框架，分解为线性复杂度的子问题，并利用局部信息优化估计。

Result: 算法在速度和紧密度上优于基准方法，且在小输入区域接近精确值。

Conclusion: 该方法在计算效率和紧密度上均有显著提升，且与实际网络鲁棒性一致。

Abstract: The Lipschitz constant is a key measure for certifying the robustness of
neural networks to input perturbations. However, computing the exact constant
is NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve
solving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with
network size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local
information on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We
address this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields
tight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.
Specifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly
flexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing
Lipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary
choices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this
generalized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational
complexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth. We also
develop a variant that achieves near-instantaneous computation through
closed-form solutions to each sub-problem. All our algorithms are accompanied
by theoretical guarantees on feasibility and validity. Next, we develop a
series of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate
local information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms
achieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing
significantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches. Moreover, we
show that our algorithms provide strict upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant
with values approaching the exact Jacobian from autodiff when the input region
is small enough. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our approach
by showing that our Lipschitz estimates closely align with network robustness.

Result: 解码器模型表现较差，但新方法显著提升了其性能，缩小了与编码器模型的差距。

Conclusion: 新方法扩展了跨模态适应任务的模型选择范围，推动了科学机器学习的发展。

Abstract: Large language models have shown great success on natural language tasks in
recent years, but they have also shown great promise when adapted to new
modalities, e.g., for scientific machine learning tasks. Even though
decoder-only models are more popular within NLP and scale exceedingly well at
generating natural language, most proposed approaches for cross-modal
adaptation focus on encoder-only models, raising the question of how model
architecture affects these approaches. In this paper, we therefore perform a
series of ablation studies to answer this question, systematically comparing
encoder-only and decoder-only models on cross-modal adaptation for
time-dependent simulation tasks based on partial differential equations (PDEs).
We find that decoder-only models are far worse than encoder-only models, when
existing approaches are applied unmodified. In contrast to several other
domains, scaling decoder-only models also does not help. To harness the
potential of decoder-only models in this context, we introduce two novel
approaches, Parallel Flipping and Sequence Doubling, attempting to mimic
bidirectionality in autoregressive models. Both our methods improve overall
performance using decoder-only models for all tasks and all cross-model
adaptation methods, closing the gap to encoder-only model performance. We hope
that our findings broaden the spectrum of models used on cross-modal adaptation
tasks to further scientific ML.

Result: 实验表明AG显著提升DT算法性能，部分结果达到SOTA水平。

Conclusion: AG方法有效解决了DT的挑战，实现了稳定且高性能的离线RL。

Abstract: Decision Transformer (DT), which integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with
the transformer model, introduces a novel approach to offline RL. Unlike
classical algorithms that take maximizing cumulative discounted rewards as
objective, DT instead maximizes the likelihood of actions. This paradigm shift,
however, presents two key challenges: stitching trajectories and extrapolation
of action. Existing methods, such as substituting specific tokens with
predictive values and integrating the Policy Gradient (PG) method, address
these challenges individually but fail to improve performance stably when
combined due to inherent instability. To address this, we propose Action
Gradient (AG), an innovative methodology that directly adjusts actions to
fulfill a function analogous to that of PG, while also facilitating efficient
integration with token prediction techniques. AG utilizes the gradient of the
Q-value with respect to the action to optimize the action. The empirical
results demonstrate that our method can significantly enhance the performance
of DT-based algorithms, with some results achieving state-of-the-art levels.

Result: 所有预训练网络的挫折水平均低于零模型，表明网络行为更有序且接近单调。

Conclusion: 深度卷积神经网络倾向于表现出比零模型更有序的行为，暗示了一种新的隐含正则化形式。

Abstract: For the signed graph associated to a deep neural network, one can compute the
frustration level, i.e., test how close or distant the graph is to structural
balance. For all the pretrained deep convolutional neural networks we consider,
we find that the frustration is always less than expected from null models.
From a statistical physics point of view, and in particular in reference to an
Ising spin glass model, the reduced frustration indicates that the amount of
disorder encoded in the network is less than in the null models. From a
functional point of view, low frustration (i.e., proximity to structural
balance) means that the function representing the network behaves
near-monotonically, i.e., more similarly to a monotone function than in the
null models. Evidence of near-monotonic behavior along the partial order
determined by frustration is observed for all networks we consider. This
confirms that the class of deep convolutional neural networks tends to have a
more ordered behavior than expected from null models, and suggests a novel form
of implicit regularization.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and
ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire
specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great
utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two
security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make
them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network
connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the
system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a
sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms
produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work
addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private
optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language
models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering
enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our
optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language
model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We
demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two
synthetic datasets.

Abstract: We study the cosine similarity of sentence transformer embeddings and observe
that they are well modeled by gamma mixtures. From a fixed corpus, we measure
similarities between all document embeddings and a reference query embedding.
Empirically we find that these distributions are often well captured by a gamma
distribution shifted and truncated to [-1,1], and in many cases, by a gamma
mixture. We propose a heuristic model in which a hierarchical clustering of
topics naturally leads to a gamma-mixture structure in the similarity scores.
Finally, we outline an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting shifted
gamma mixtures, which provides a practical tool for modeling similarity
distributions.

Result: 实验表明，新方法显著提升了对抗鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 新正则化策略有效解决了MSE的局限性，提升了对抗训练的效果。

Abstract: Adversarial training is the most effective defense against adversarial
attacks. The effectiveness of the adversarial attacks has been on the design of
its loss function and regularization term. The most widely used loss function
in adversarial training is cross-entropy and mean squared error (MSE) as its
regularization objective. However, MSE enforces overly uniform optimization
between two output distributions during training, which limits its robustness
in adversarial training scenarios. To address this issue, we revisit the idea
of mutual learning (originally designed for knowledge distillation) and propose
two novel regularization strategies tailored for adversarial training: (i)
weighted adversarial mutual regularization and (ii) adversarial generalization
regularization. In the former, we formulate a decomposed adversarial mutual
Kullback-Leibler divergence (KL-divergence) loss, which allows flexible control
over the optimization process by assigning unequal weights to the main and
auxiliary objectives. In the latter, we introduce an additional clean target
distribution into the adversarial training objective, improving generalization
and enhancing model robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed methods significantly improve adversarial robustness compared to
existing regularization-based approaches.

Abstract: Modern sensing and metrology systems now stream terabytes of heterogeneous,
high-dimensional (HD) data profiles, images, and dense point clouds, whose
natural representation is multi-way tensors. Understanding such data requires
regression models that preserve tensor geometry, yet remain expressive enough
to capture the pronounced nonlinear interactions that dominate many industrial
and mechanical processes. Existing tensor-based regressors meet the first
requirement but remain essentially linear. Conversely, conventional neural
networks offer nonlinearity only after flattening, thereby discarding spatial
structure and incurring prohibitive parameter counts. This paper introduces a
Tensor-on-Tensor Regression Neural Network (TRNN) that unifies these two
paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO的固定温度参数导致在多样化偏好数据上训练效果不佳，容易过拟合简单样本或忽略信息丰富的样本。

Method: MADPO采用两步法：先训练奖励模型估计偏好边界，再根据边界为每个样本自适应调整DPO损失权重。

Result: 在情感生成任务中，MADPO显著优于基线方法，高质量数据上提升33.3%，低质量数据上提升10.5%。

Conclusion: MADPO是一种更稳健且理论完备的偏好对齐方法。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
method for aligning large language models. However, its reliance on a fixed
temperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,
causing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.
Recent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general
overfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more
targeted approach of $\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its
batch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to
mixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative
$\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful
training signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference
Optimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and
instance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first
trains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these
margins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each
individual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective
target margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,
allowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a
comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved
optimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We
validate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where
MADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across
datasets of varying quality. It achieves performance gains of up to +33.3\% on
High Quality data and +10.5\% on Low Quality data over the next-best method.
Our results establish MADPO as a more robust and principled approach to
preference alignment.

Abstract: We propose Physics-informed Attention-enhanced Fourier Neural Operator
(PIANO) to solve the Nonlinear Force-Free Field (NLFFF) problem in solar
physics. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on iterative numerical
methods, our proposed PIANO directly learns the 3D magnetic field structure
from 2D boundary conditions. Specifically, PIANO integrates Efficient Channel
Attention (ECA) mechanisms with Dilated Convolutions (DC), which enhances the
model's ability to capture multimodal input by prioritizing critical channels
relevant to the magnetic field's variations. Furthermore, we apply
physics-informed loss by enforcing the force-free and divergence-free
conditions in the training process so that our prediction is consistent with
underlying physics with high accuracy. Experimental results on the ISEE NLFFF
dataset show that our PIANO not only outperforms state-of-the-art neural
operators in terms of accuracy but also shows strong consistency with the
physical characteristics of NLFFF data across magnetic fields reconstructed
from various solar active regions. The GitHub of this project is available

Conclusion: MT-DAO有效解决了跨数据中心和广域地理区域的训练问题，显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: Training large models with distributed data parallelism (DDP) requires
frequent communication of gradients across workers, which can saturate
bandwidth. Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this
overhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance
gap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale
mismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,
decays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to
noise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of
optimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the
gradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we
provide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model
pre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming
infrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token
wall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects. At the 720M scale, MT-DAO
reaches a target perplexity in 24% fewer steps and 35% less time than the
single-momentum DDP baseline. MT-DAO enables effective cross-datacenter
training and training over wide geographic areas.

Abstract: Quantizing the key-value (KV) cache is a promising strategy for improving the
inference efficiency of large language models (LLMs). However, aggressive
quantization to very low precision (e.g., 2 bits) introduces significant errors
in the stored key and value tensors, which propagate through the dot-product
attention mechanism and ultimately degrade generation quality. To address this,
we propose KVLinC, a framework to mitigate attention errors introduced by KV
cache quantization in the extreme low-precision regime. KVLinC combines a
Hadamard rotation, which reduces quantization error in values, with lightweight
linear correction adapters that explicitly compensate for errors introduced by
quantized keys. Across extensive evaluations on the LLaMA, Qwen2.5, and Qwen3
model families, KVLinC consistently matches or surpasses strong baselines while
achieving higher KV-cache compression. Furthermore, we implement a custom
attention kernel that results in upto 2.55x faster inference compared to Flash
Attention baseline, enabling efficient long-context LLM inference.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a useful framework for
approximating partial differential equation solutions using deep learning
methods. In this paper, we propose a principled redesign of the PINNsformer, a
Transformer-based PINN architecture. We present the Spectral PINNSformer
(S-Pformer), a refinement of encoder-decoder PINNSformers that addresses two
key issues; 1. the redundancy (i.e. increased parameter count) of the encoder,
and 2. the mitigation of spectral bias. We find that the encoder is unnecessary
for capturing spatiotemporal correlations when relying solely on
self-attention, thereby reducing parameter count. Further, we integrate Fourier
feature embeddings to explicitly mitigate spectral bias, enabling adaptive
encoding of multiscale behaviors in the frequency domain. Our model outperforms
encoder-decoder PINNSformer architectures across all benchmarks, achieving or
outperforming MLP performance while reducing parameter count significantly.

Result: 算法在神经元数量m和样本数量T下，误差界为O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})。

Conclusion: 该方法在高维和大样本情况下具有理论保证，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Estimating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between random variables is a
fundamental problem in statistical analysis. For continuous random variables,
traditional information-theoretic estimators scale poorly with dimension and/or
sample size. To mitigate this challenge, a variety of methods have been
proposed to estimate KL divergences and related quantities, such as mutual
information, using neural networks. The existing theoretical analyses show that
neural network parameters achieving low error exist. However, since they rely
on non-constructive neural network approximation theorems, they do not
guarantee that the existing algorithms actually achieve low error. In this
paper, we propose a KL divergence estimation algorithm using a shallow neural
network with randomized hidden weights and biases (i.e. a random feature
method). We show that with high probability, the algorithm achieves a KL
divergence estimation error of $O(m^{-1/2}+T^{-1/3})$, where $m$ is the number
of neurons and $T$ is both the number of steps of the algorithm and the number
of samples.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient temperature prediction is critical for optimizing the
preheating process of PET preforms in industrial microwave systems prior to
blow molding. We propose a novel deep learning framework for generalized
temperature prediction. Unlike traditional models that require extensive
retraining for each material or design variation, our method introduces a
data-efficient neural architecture that leverages transfer learning and model
fusion to generalize across unseen scenarios. By pretraining specialized neural
regressor on distinct conditions such as recycled PET heat capacities or
varying preform geometries and integrating their representations into a unified
global model, we create a system capable of learning shared thermal dynamics
across heterogeneous inputs. The architecture incorporates skip connections to
enhance stability and prediction accuracy. Our approach reduces the need for
large simulation datasets while achieving superior performance compared to
models trained from scratch. Experimental validation on two case studies
material variability and geometric diversity demonstrates significant
improvements in generalization, establishing a scalable ML-based solution for
intelligent thermal control in manufacturing environments. Moreover, the
approach highlights how data-efficient generalization strategies can extend to
other industrial applications involving complex physical modeling with limited
data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 太阳质子事件对卫星、宇航员和技术系统造成严重辐射危害，准确预测其质子通量时间剖面对于早期预警和缓解至关重要。

Method: 使用40个SPE数据集（1997-2017），通过4折分层交叉验证评估不同seq2seq模型配置，包括输入类型（质子或质子+X射线）、数据预处理（原始或趋势平滑）和预测方式（自回归或一次性预测）。

Result: 一次性预测误差低于自回归预测；原始数据上质子模型优于质子+X射线模型，但趋势平滑后差距缩小或反转；趋势平滑显著提升质子+X射线模型性能；最佳模型基于原始数据训练。

Conclusion: 模型架构选择有时能超越数据预处理的优势，趋势平滑对质子+X射线模型效果显著，但原始数据训练的模型表现最佳。

Abstract: Solar Proton Events (SPEs) cause significant radiation hazards to satellites,
astronauts, and technological systems. Accurate forecasting of their proton
flux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper
explores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long
Short-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following
SPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by
NOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and
undisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we
evaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding
dimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.
combined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,
and (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as
follows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than
autoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative
approaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform
proton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or
reverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances
the performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray
channel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on
average, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting
that architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data
preprocessing.

Method: 提出NoiseCurve技术，利用公共未标记数据估计模型曲率，优化跨迭代噪声相关性。

Result: 实验表明，NoiseCurve在多种数据集、模型和隐私参数下均显著优于DP-MF的噪声相关性方案。

Conclusion: NoiseCurve有效提升了隐私保护训练的准确性，为DP-SGD的改进提供了新思路。

Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) offers the
promise of training deep learning models while mitigating many privacy risks.
However, there is currently a large accuracy gap between DP-SGD and normal SGD
training. This has resulted in different lines of research investigating
orthogonal ways of improving privacy-preserving training. One such line of
work, known as DP-MF, correlates the privacy noise across different iterations
of stochastic gradient descent -- allowing later iterations to cancel out some
of the noise added to earlier iterations. In this paper, we study how to
improve this noise correlation. We propose a technique called NoiseCurve that
uses model curvature, estimated from public unlabeled data, to improve the
quality of this cross-iteration noise correlation. Our experiments on various
datasets, models, and privacy parameters show that the noise correlations
computed by NoiseCurve offer consistent and significant improvements in
accuracy over the correlation scheme used by DP-MF.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归解码是大语言模型的主要延迟瓶颈，现有推测解码方法需要大量离线训练或额外组件，增加了成本和脆弱性。

Method: DVI将LLM分为起草者和验证者，验证者的决策转化为监督信号更新起草者，结合在线蒸馏和策略梯度。

Result: 在Spec-Bench上，DVI实现了2.16倍的加速，与EAGLE-2相当，但训练数据需求大幅减少。

Conclusion: DVI展示了训练感知的自推测方法能以最小训练开销实现最先进的无损加速。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) decoding is a major latency bottleneck for large language
models. Speculative decoding (SD) accelerates AR by letting a drafter propose
multi-token blocks that a verifier accepts or rejects. However, many SD systems
require heavy offline training or extra components. These choices raise
data/compute cost and can yield brittle drafters under distribution drift. We
introduce \emph{Draft, Verify, \& Improve (DVI)}, a training-aware
self-speculative framework that combines inference with continual online
learning. We partition an LLM into a drafter and a verifier, and during
generation, verifier accept/reject decisions are converted into supervision
signals and used to update the drafter head. A simple \emph{KL$\rightarrow$RL}
schedule bootstraps calibration via online distillation and then adds
reward-masked cross-entropy with a on-policy policy-gradient term, preserving
lossless, single model deployment. On Spec-Bench, DVI achieves a $2.16\times$
wall-time speedup, on par with SoTA approaches like EAGLE-2, while orders of
magnitude less data for training, and ablations show that DVI outperforms
KL-only online distillation. DVI demonstrates that \emph{training-aware}
self-speculation can deliver state-of-the-art, lossless speedups with minimal
training overhead.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) is emerging as a potentially
transformative paradigm for modeling complex biomedical systems by integrating
parameterized physical laws with data-driven methods. Here, we review three
main classes of PIML frameworks: physics-informed neural networks (PINNs),
neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), and neural operators (NOs),
highlighting their growing role in biomedical science and engineering. We begin
with PINNs, which embed governing equations into deep learning models and have
been successfully applied to biosolid and biofluid mechanics, mechanobiology,
and medical imaging among other areas. We then review NODEs, which offer
continuous-time modeling, especially suited to dynamic physiological systems,
pharmacokinetics, and cell signaling. Finally, we discuss deep NOs as powerful
tools for learning mappings between function spaces, enabling efficient
simulations across multiscale and spatially heterogeneous biological domains.
Throughout, we emphasize applications where physical interpretability, data
scarcity, or system complexity make conventional black-box learning
insufficient. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future directions
for advancing PIML in biomedical science and engineering, including issues of
uncertainty quantification, generalization, and integration of PIML and large
language models.

TL;DR: ARLAS框架通过对抗性强化学习提升LLM代理的安全性，自动生成多样化的提示注入攻击并训练代理防御，显著降低攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御策略依赖手工攻击模式的数据集，缺乏多样性，无法应对新型提示注入攻击。

Method: 采用对抗性强化学习，将问题建模为零和博弈，共同训练攻击者和防御者LLM，并使用基于种群的学习框架。

Result: 在BrowserGym和AgentDojo上评估，ARLAS显著降低攻击成功率并提高任务成功率。

Conclusion: ARLAS生成的多样化攻击使代理更鲁棒，优于基础模型。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents can leverage tools such as Google Search to
complete complex tasks. However, this tool usage introduces the risk of
indirect prompt injections, where malicious instructions hidden in tool outputs
can manipulate the agent, posing security risks like data leakage. Current
defense strategies typically rely on fine-tuning LLM agents on datasets of
known attacks. However, the generation of these datasets relies on manually
crafted attack patterns, which limits their diversity and leaves agents
vulnerable to novel prompt injections. To address this limitation, we propose
Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Agent Safety (ARLAS), a novel framework
that leverages adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) by formulating the
problem as a two-player zero-sum game. ARLAS co-trains two LLMs: an attacker
that learns to autonomously generate diverse prompt injections and an agent
that learns to defend against them while completing its assigned tasks. To
ensure robustness against a wide range of attacks and to prevent cyclic
learning, we employ a population-based learning framework that trains the agent
to defend against all previous attacker checkpoints. Evaluated on BrowserGym
and AgentDojo, agents fine-tuned with ARLAS achieve a significantly lower
attack success rate than the original model while also improving their task
success rate. Our analysis further confirms that the adversarial process
generates a diverse and challenging set of attacks, leading to a more robust
agent compared to the base model.

Result: 在已知和未知协方差情况下，分别获得更优的元遗憾保证，实验显示算法能快速跟踪元先知。

Conclusion: 首次为Thompson风格RL提供元遗憾保证，并提出实用方法，适用于实验丰富的场景。

Abstract: We study meta-reinforcement learning in finite-horizon MDPs where related
tasks share similar structures in their optimal action-value functions.
Specifically, we posit a linear representation
$Q^*_h(s,a)=\Phi_h(s,a)\,\theta^{(k)}_h$ and place a Gaussian meta-prior $
\mathcal{N}(\theta^*_h,\Sigma^*_h)$ over the task-specific parameters
$\theta^{(k)}_h$. Building on randomized value functions, we propose two
Thompson-style algorithms: (i) MTSRL, which learns only the prior mean and
performs posterior sampling with the learned mean and known covariance; and
(ii) $\text{MTSRL}^{+}$, which additionally estimates the covariance and
employs prior widening to control finite-sample estimation error. Further, we
develop a prior-alignment technique that couples the posterior under the
learned prior with a meta-oracle that knows the true prior, yielding
meta-regret guarantees: we match prior-independent Thompson sampling in the
small-task regime and strictly improve with more tasks once the prior is
learned. Concretely, for known covariance we obtain
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{ANK})$ meta-regret, and with learned covariance
$\tilde{O}(H^{4}S^{3/2}\sqrt{AN^3K})$; both recover a better behavior than
prior-independent after $K \gtrsim \tilde{O}(H^2)$ and $K \gtrsim
\tilde{O}(N^2H^2)$, respectively. Simulations on a stateful recommendation
environment (with feature and prior misspecification) show that after brief
exploration, MTSRL/MTSRL\(^+\) track the meta-oracle and substantially
outperform prior-independent RL and bandit-only meta-baselines. Our results
give the first meta-regret guarantees for Thompson-style RL with learned
Q-priors, and provide practical recipes (warm-start via RLSVI, OLS aggregation,
covariance widening) for experiment-rich settings.

Abstract: Conceptual rainfall-runoff models aid hydrologists and climate scientists in
modelling streamflow to inform water management practices. Recent advances in
deep learning have unravelled the potential for combining hydrological models
with deep learning models for better interpretability and improved predictive
performance. In our previous work, we introduced DeepGR4J, which enhanced the
GR4J conceptual rainfall-runoff model using a deep learning model to serve as a
surrogate for the routing component. DeepGR4J had an improved rainfall-runoff
prediction accuracy, particularly in arid catchments. Quantile regression
models have been extensively used for quantifying uncertainty while aiding
extreme value forecasting. In this paper, we extend DeepGR4J using a quantile
regression-based ensemble learning framework to quantify uncertainty in
streamflow prediction. We also leverage the uncertainty bounds to identify
extreme flow events potentially leading to flooding. We further extend the
model to multi-step streamflow predictions for uncertainty bounds. We design
experiments for a detailed evaluation of the proposed framework using the
CAMELS-Aus dataset. The results show that our proposed Quantile DeepGR4J
framework improves the predictive accuracy and uncertainty interval quality
(interval score) compared to baseline deep learning models. Furthermore, we
carry out flood risk evaluation using Quantile DeepGR4J, and the results
demonstrate its suitability as an early warning system.

Result: AMAQ在相同位预算下，比固定精度方法提高了2.5%的生成准确率和1.3%的分类准确率，同时增强了训练稳定性。

Conclusion: AMAQ是一种高效且实用的解决方案，能够在分布式训练中以较低的通信成本提供优越的推理准确性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are scaling rapidly, creating significant
challenges for collaborative server client distributed training, particularly
in terms of communication efficiency and computational overheads. To address
these challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which
effectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on
low-resource devices.
  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce
Adaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that
progressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8
bits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively
allocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise
importance using bit regularization.
  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,
delivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better
classification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,
it significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit
representation collapse during the training.
  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical
multi-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference
accuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during
training. This trade off makes AMAQ a practical and effective solution for
collaborative training with minimal communication cost.

Conclusion: ATOM为准确、高效且可迁移的分子动力学模型迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations underpin modern computational drug dis-
covery, materials science, and biochemistry. Recent machine learning models
provide high-fidelity MD predictions without the need to repeatedly solve
quantum mechanical forces, enabling significant speedups over conventional
pipelines. Yet many such methods typically enforce strict equivariance and rely
on sequential rollouts, thus limiting their flexibility and simulation
efficiency. They are also com- monly single-task, trained on individual
molecules and fixed timeframes, which restricts generalization to unseen
compounds and extended timesteps. To address these issues, we propose Atomistic
Transformer Operator for Molecules (ATOM), a pretrained transformer neural
operator for multitask molecular dynamics. ATOM adopts a quasi-equivariant
design that requires no explicit molecular graph and employs a temporal
attention mechanism, allowing for the accurate parallel decod- ing of multiple
future states. To support operator pretraining across chemicals and timescales,
we curate TG80, a large, diverse, and numerically stable MD dataset with over
2.5 million femtoseconds of trajectories across 80 compounds. ATOM achieves
state-of-the-art performance on established single-task benchmarks, such as
MD17, RMD17 and MD22. After multitask pretraining on TG80, ATOM shows
exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen molecules across varying time
hori- zons. We believe ATOM represents a significant step toward accurate,
efficient, and transferable molecular dynamics models

Result: 在简单测试问题中，AION通过单次下降步骤达到最优解，展示了非迭代收敛的可能性。

Conclusion: 无限下降法为半解析优化模型开辟了新方向，提出了“无限类”模型的概念，为非迭代学习提供了可能。

Abstract: Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed
through small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.
Williams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through
truncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes
Rendus Math\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of
Fluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work
introduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation
paradigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order
optimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this
method yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of
the infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an
exploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.
  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,
Infinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed
expressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a
simple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.
Together, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables
exact, non-iterative convergence. Infinite Descent extends beyond this example,
applying to any appropriately closed architecture. This suggests a new class of
semi-analytically optimisable models: the \emph{Infinity Class}; sufficient
conditions for class membership are discussed. This offers a pathway toward
non-iterative learning.

Conclusion: 正交化与自适应学习率互补，为大规模深度学习优化器设计提供新思路。

Abstract: The choice of optimizer significantly impacts the training efficiency and
computational costs of large language models (LLMs). Recently, the Muon
optimizer has demonstrated promising results by orthogonalizing parameter
updates, improving optimization geometry through better conditioning. Despite
Muon's emergence as a candidate successor to Adam, the potential for jointly
leveraging their strengths has not been systematically explored. In this work,
we bridge this gap by proposing NorMuon (Neuron-wise Normalized Muon), an
optimizer that synergistically combines orthogonalization with neuron-level
adaptive learning rates. Our analysis reveals that while Muon effectively
reduces condition numbers, the resulting updates exhibit highly non-uniform
neuron norms, causing certain neurons to dominate the optimization process.
NorMuon addresses this imbalance by maintaining second-order momentum
statistics for each neuron and applying row-wise normalization after
orthogonalization, ensuring balanced parameter utilization while preserving
Muon's conditioning benefits. To enable practical deployment at scale, we
develop an efficient distributed implementation under the FSDP2 framework that
strategically distributes orthogonalization computations across devices.
Experiments across multiple model scales demonstrate that NorMuon consistently
outperforms both Adam and Muon, achieving 21.74% better training efficiency
than Adam and 11.31% improvement over Muon on 1.1 B pretraining setting, while
maintaining a comparable memory footprint to Muon. Our findings suggest that
orthogonalization and adaptive learning rates are complementary rather than
competing approaches, opening new avenues for optimizer design in large-scale
deep learning.

Motivation: 解决真实ECG数据共享受限的问题，提升生成ECG的信任度和临床实用性。

Method: 结合Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training（MIDT-ECG）和多模态人口统计条件，增强形态保真度和个性化生成。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上评估，MIDT-ECG显著提升形态一致性、隐私保护（指标提升4-8%），并减少导联间相关性误差74%。

Conclusion: MIDT-ECG可作为高保真、隐私保护的个性化ECG替代方案，推动生成AI在医疗中的负责任使用。

Abstract: The development of machine learning for cardiac care is severely hampered by
privacy restrictions on sharing real patient electrocardiogram (ECG) data.
Although generative AI offers a promising solution, the real-world use of
existing model-synthesized ECGs is limited by persistent gaps in
trustworthiness and clinical utility. In this work, we address two major
shortcomings of current generative ECG methods: insufficient morphological
fidelity and the inability to generate personalized, patient-specific
physiological signals. To address these gaps, we build on a conditional
diffusion-based Structured State Space Model (SSSD-ECG) with two principled
innovations: (1) MIDT-ECG (Mel-Spectrogram Informed Diffusion Training), a
novel training paradigm with time-frequency domain supervision to enforce
physiological structural realism, and (2) multi-modal demographic conditioning
to enable patient-specific synthesis. We comprehensively evaluate our approach
on the PTB-XL dataset, assessing the synthesized ECG signals on fidelity,
clinical coherence, privacy preservation, and downstream task utility. MIDT-ECG
achieves substantial gains: it improves morphological coherence, preserves
strong privacy guarantees with all metrics evaluated exceeding the baseline by
4-8%, and notably reduces the interlead correlation error by an average of 74%,
while demographic conditioning enhances signal-to-noise ratio and
personalization. In critical low-data regimes, a classifier trained on datasets
supplemented with our synthetic ECGs achieves performance comparable to a
classifier trained solely on real data. Together, we demonstrate that ECG
synthesizers, trained with the proposed time-frequency structural
regularization scheme, can serve as personalized, high-fidelity,
privacy-preserving surrogates when real data are scarce, advancing the
responsible use of generative AI in healthcare.

TL;DR: 该论文通过电路复杂性视角，分析了等变图神经网络（EGNNs）在晶体结构预测中的计算和表达能力极限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管EGNNs在材料科学中表现出色，但其在周期性、对称性约束下的表达能力尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析EGNN层的计算，证明其在多项式精度下可被均匀的TC0阈值电路家族模拟。

Result: EGNNs的计算能力被定位在TC0复杂度内，明确了其资源约束下的预测能力上限。

Conclusion: 研究为晶体系统的对称感知图学习提供了复杂性理论基础，并指出了超越TC0所需的架构改进。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have become a core paradigm for learning on
relational data. In materials science, equivariant GNNs (EGNNs) have emerged as
a compelling backbone for crystalline-structure prediction, owing to their
ability to respect Euclidean symmetries and periodic boundary conditions.
Despite strong empirical performance, their expressive power in periodic,
symmetry-constrained settings remains poorly understood. This work
characterizes the intrinsic computational and expressive limits of EGNNs for
crystalline-structure prediction through a circuit-complexity lens. We analyze
the computations carried out by EGNN layers acting on node features, atomic
coordinates, and lattice matrices, and prove that, under polynomial precision,
embedding width $d=O(n)$ for $n$ nodes, $O(1)$ layers, and $O(1)$-depth,
$O(n)$-width MLP instantiations of the message/update/readout maps, these
models admit a simulation by a uniform $\mathsf{TC}^0$ threshold-circuit family
of polynomial size (with an explicit constant-depth bound). Situating EGNNs
within $\mathsf{TC}^0$ provides a concrete ceiling on the decision and
prediction problems solvable by such architectures under realistic resource
constraints and clarifies which architectural modifications (e.g., increased
depth, richer geometric primitives, or wider layers) are required to transcend
this regime. The analysis complements Weisfeiler-Lehman style results that do
not directly transfer to periodic crystals, and offers a complexity-theoretic
foundation for symmetry-aware graph learning on crystalline systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医院中依赖自我报告或非特异性EKG的疼痛评估问题，尤其针对重症、镇静和认知障碍患者。

Method: 使用52名健康成年人的激光诱发疼痛EEG数据，提取537个特征，评估九种机器学习模型。

Result: 支持向量机离线准确率88.9%，XGBoost实时准确率94.2%，延迟4毫秒。

Conclusion: EEG疼痛监测在临床中技术可行，为临床验证提供了路径。

Abstract: Current pain assessment within hospitals often relies on self-reporting or
non-specific EKG vital signs. This system leaves critically ill, sedated, and
cognitively impaired patients vulnerable to undertreated pain and opioid
overuse. Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a noninvasive method of measuring
brain activity. This technology could potentially be applied as an assistive
tool to highlight nociceptive processing in order to mitigate this issue. In
this study, we compared machine learning models for classifying high-pain
versus low/no-pain EEG epochs using data from fifty-two healthy adults exposed
to laser-evoked pain at three intensities (low, medium, high). Each four-second
epoch was transformed into a 537-feature vector spanning spectral power, band
ratios, Hjorth parameters, entropy measures, coherence, wavelet energies, and
peak-frequency metrics. Nine traditional machine learning models were evaluated
with leave-one-participant-out cross-validation. A support vector machine with
radial basis function kernel achieved the best offline performance with 88.9%
accuracy and sub-millisecond inference time (1.02 ms). Our Feature importance
analysis was consistent with current canonical pain physiology, showing
contralateral alpha suppression, midline theta/alpha enhancement, and frontal
gamma bursts. The real-time XGBoost model maintained an end-to-end latency of
about 4 ms and 94.2% accuracy, demonstrating that an EEG-based pain monitor is
technically feasible within a clinical setting and provides a pathway towards
clinical validation.

Motivation: 解决高维黑盒问题中贝叶斯优化的挑战，提升收敛速度和降低遗憾。

Method: 使用高斯过程代理模型联合学习梯度和Hessian信息，通过牛顿步误差的一步前瞻界选择评估点，并在低维子空间中优化采集函数。

Result: 在高维合成和实际问题中，NeST-BO表现出比现有方法更快的收敛速度和更低的遗憾。

Conclusion: NeST-BO在高维黑盒优化中具有显著优势，适用于大规模和未知活跃子空间的问题。

Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is effective for expensive black-box problems but
remains challenging in high dimensions. We propose NeST-BO, a local BO method
that targets the Newton step by jointly learning gradient and Hessian
information with Gaussian process surrogates, and selecting evaluations via a
one-step lookahead bound on Newton-step error. We show that this bound (and
hence the step error) contracts with batch size, so NeST-BO directly inherits
inexact-Newton convergence: global progress under mild stability assumptions
and quadratic local rates once steps are sufficiently accurate. To scale, we
optimize the acquisition in low-dimensional subspaces (e.g., random embeddings
or learned sparse subspaces), reducing the dominant cost of learning curvature
from $O(d^2)$ to $O(m^2)$ with $m \ll d$ while preserving step targeting.
Across high-dimensional synthetic and real-world problems, including cases with
thousands of variables and unknown active subspaces, NeST-BO consistently
yields faster convergence and lower regret than state-of-the-art local and
high-dimensional BO baselines.

Result: 理论证明算法在数据损坏情况下仍能保持最佳泛化误差率，实验验证其有效性。

Conclusion: RLHF-COV和DPO-COV算法高效且理论可靠，解决了RLHF和DPO中的三大问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and direct preference
optimization (DPO) are important techniques to align large language models
(LLM) with human preference. However, the quality of RLHF and DPO training is
seriously compromised by \textit{\textbf{C}orrupted} preference, reward
\textit{\textbf{O}veroptimization}, and bias towards
\textit{\textbf{V}erbosity}. To our knowledge, most existing works tackle only
one of these important issues, and the few other works require much computation
to estimate multiple reward models and lack theoretical guarantee of
generalization ability. In this work, we propose RLHF-\textbf{COV} and
DPO-\textbf{COV} algorithms that can simultaneously mitigate these three
issues, in both offline and online settings. This ability is theoretically
demonstrated by obtaining length-regularized generalization error rates for our
DPO-COV algorithms trained on corrupted data, which match the best-known rates
for simpler cases with clean data and without length regularization. Moreover,
our DPO-COV algorithm is simple to implement without reward estimation, and is
proved to be equivalent to our RLHF-COV algorithm, which directly implies the
equivalence between the vanilla RLHF and DPO algorithms. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our DPO-COV algorithms under both offline and
online settings.

Result: 理论证明了对齐矩阵的稳定性，实验表明GTRANS能显著提升目标图估计的准确性。

Conclusion: GTRANS有效提升了小目标图的估计精度，并在下游任务（如图分类和链接预测）中表现出色。

Abstract: Graphon models provide a flexible nonparametric framework for estimating
latent connectivity probabilities in networks, enabling a range of downstream
applications such as link prediction and data augmentation. However, accurate
graphon estimation typically requires a large graph, whereas in practice, one
often only observes a small-sized network. One approach to addressing this
issue is to adopt a transfer learning framework, which aims to improve
estimation in a small target graph by leveraging structural information from a
larger, related source graph. In this paper, we propose a novel method, namely
GTRANS, a transfer learning framework that integrates neighborhood smoothing
and Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align and transfer structural
patterns between graphs. To prevent negative transfer, GTRANS includes an
adaptive debiasing mechanism that identifies and corrects for target-specific
deviations via residual smoothing. We provide theoretical guarantees on the
stability of the estimated alignment matrix and demonstrate the effectiveness
of GTRANS in improving the accuracy of target graph estimation through
extensive synthetic and real data experiments. These improvements translate
directly to enhanced performance in downstream applications, such as the graph
classification task and the link prediction task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型（LLMs）部署中的计算和内存需求问题，同时减少现有2:4稀疏剪枝方法带来的性能损失。

Method: ARMOR将权重矩阵分解为2:4稀疏核心和两个低开销的块对角矩阵，通过块坐标下降算法优化层间代理损失。

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上，ARMOR在性能和压缩效果上均优于现有2:4剪枝方法。

Conclusion: ARMOR在模型压缩和任务准确性之间实现了更优的权衡，同时保持了推理速度和内存使用的优势。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) present significant deployment challenges due to
their immense computational and memory requirements. While semi-structured
pruning, particularly 2:4 sparsity, offers a path to practical hardware
acceleration, existing methods often incur substantial performance degradation.
To bridge this gap, we introduce ARMOR: (Adaptive Representation with
Matrix-factORization), a novel one-shot post-training pruning algorithm.
Instead of directly pruning weights, ARMOR factorizes each weight matrix into a
2:4 sparse core wrapped by two low-overhead, block diagonal matrices. These
wrappers act as efficient pre and post-transformation error correctors,
offering greater flexibility to preserve model quality compared to conventional
2:4 pruning techniques. The sparse core and block diagonal wrappers are chosen
through a block coordinate descent algorithm that minimizes a layer-wise proxy
loss. We theoretically prove this optimization is guaranteed to converge to a
solution with a proxy loss less than or equal to state-of-the-art pruning
algorithms. Experiments on Llama (Touvron et al., 2023; Dubey et al., 2024) and
Qwen (Yang et al., 2025) model families demonstrate that ARMOR consistently and
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning methods across a wide
range of downstream tasks and perplexity evaluations. ARMOR achieves this
superior performance while retaining the inference speedups and substantial
memory usage reductions of 2:4 pruning, establishing a more effective trade-off
between model compression and task accuracy

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法（如Tent）在小批量或复杂损坏下不稳定且容易遗忘源知识，LATTA旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LATTA结合了随机梯度Langevin动力学的噪声权重扰动和稳定权重锚点机制，避免陷入局部极小值并保持源知识。

Result: 在Rotated-MNIST和CIFAR-10-C等基准测试中，LATTA显著优于现有方法，平均准确率提升2%以上。

Conclusion: LATTA在保持稳定性的同时，显著提升了测试时自适应的性能，成为新的最先进方法。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to adapt a pretrained model to distribution
shifts using only unlabeled test data. While promising, existing methods like
Tent suffer from instability and can catastrophically forget the source
knowledge, especially with small batch sizes or challenging corruptions. We
argue that this arises from overly deterministic updates on a complex loss
surface. In this paper, we introduce Langevin-Anchored Test-Time Adaptation
(LATTA), a novel approach that regularizes adaptation through two key
mechanisms: (1) a noisy weight perturbation inspired by Stochastic Gradient
Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) to explore the local parameter space and escape poor
local minima, and (2) a stable weight anchor that prevents the model from
diverging from its robust source pre-training. This combination allows LATTA to
adapt effectively without sacrificing stability. Unlike prior Bayesian TTA
methods, LATTA requires no architectural changes or expensive Monte Carlo
passes. We conduct extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including
Rotated-MNIST and the more challenging CIFAR-10-C. Our results demonstrate that
LATTA significantly outperforms existing methods, including Tent, CoTTA, and
EATA, setting a new state of the art for self-supervised TTA by improving
average accuracy on CIFAR-10-C by over 2% while simultaneously reducing
performance variance.

Abstract: Feature selection eliminates redundancy among features to improve downstream
task performance while reducing computational overhead. Existing methods often
struggle to capture intricate feature interactions and adapt across diverse
application scenarios. Recent advances employ generative intelligence to
alleviate these drawbacks. However, these methods remain constrained by
permutation sensitivity in embedding and reliance on convexity assumptions in
gradient-based search. To address these limitations, our initial work
introduces a novel framework that integrates permutation-invariant embedding
with policy-guided search. Although effective, it still left opportunities to
adapt to realistic distributed scenarios. In practice, data across local
clients is highly imbalanced, heterogeneous and constrained by strict privacy
regulations, limiting direct sharing. These challenges highlight the need for a
framework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without
exposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance
the framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving
knowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without
sharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy
to address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of
our framework. The results further demonstrate its strong generalization
ability in federated learning scenarios. The code and data are publicly

Result: 发现临界缩放因子β_n ∝ log n，解释了对数缩放如何保持稀疏且内容自适应的注意力。

Conclusion: 对数缩放因子是解决长上下文中注意力问题的关键，为现有方法提供了理论依据。

Abstract: As large language models scale to longer contexts, attention layers suffer
from a fundamental pathology: attention scores collapse toward uniformity as
context length $n$ increases, causing tokens to cluster excessively, a
phenomenon known as rank-collapse. While $\textit{attention scaling}$
effectively addresses this deficiency by rescaling attention scores with a
polylogarithmic factor $\beta_n$, theoretical justification for this approach
remains lacking.
  We analyze a simplified yet tractable model that magnifies the effect of
attention scaling. In this model, attention exhibits a phase transition
governed by the scaling factor $\beta_n$: insufficient scaling collapses all
tokens to a single direction, while excessive scaling reduces attention to
identity, thereby eliminating meaningful interactions between tokens. Our main
result identifies the critical scaling $\beta_n \asymp \log n$ and provides a
rigorous justification for attention scaling in YaRN and Qwen, clarifying why
logarithmic scaling maintains sparse, content-adaptive attention at large
context lengths.

Abstract: Spoofing detection in financial trading is crucial, especially for
identifying complex behaviors such as conspiracy spoofing. Traditional
machine-learning approaches primarily focus on isolated node features, often
overlooking the broader context of interconnected nodes. Graph-based
techniques, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), have advanced the field
by leveraging relational information effectively. However, in real-world
spoofing detection datasets, trading behaviors exhibit dynamic, irregular
patterns. Existing spoofing detection methods, though effective in some
scenarios, struggle to capture the complexity of dynamic and diverse, evolving
inter-node relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
framework called the Generative Dynamic Graph Model (GDGM), which models
dynamic trading behaviors and the relationships among nodes to learn
representations for conspiracy spoofing detection. Specifically, our approach
incorporates the generative dynamic latent space to capture the temporal
patterns and evolving market conditions. Raw trading data is first converted
into time-stamped sequences. Then we model trading behaviors using the neural
ordinary differential equations and gated recurrent units, to generate the
representation incorporating temporal dynamics of spoofing patterns.
Furthermore, pseudo-label generation and heterogeneous aggregation techniques
are employed to gather relevant information and enhance the detection
performance for conspiratorial spoofing behaviors. Experiments conducted on
spoofing detection datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art models in detection accuracy. Additionally, our spoofing
detection system has been successfully deployed in one of the largest global
trading markets, further validating the practical applicability and performance
of the proposed method.

Abstract: Graph simulation has recently received a surge of attention in graph
processing and analytics. In real-life applications, e.g. social science,
biology, and chemistry, many graphs are composed of a series of evolving graphs
(i.e., temporal graphs). While most of the existing graph generators focus on
static graphs, the temporal information of the graphs is ignored. In this
paper, we focus on simulating temporal graphs, which aim to reproduce the
structural and temporal properties of the observed real-life temporal graphs.
In this paper, we first give an overview of the existing temporal graph
generators, including recently emerged learning-based approaches. Most of these
learning-based methods suffer from one of the limitations: low efficiency in
training or slow generating, especially for temporal random walk-based methods.
Therefore, we propose an efficient learning-based approach to generate graph
snapshots, namely temporal graph autoencoder (TGAE). Specifically, we propose
an attention-based graph encoder to encode temporal and structural
characteristics on sampled ego-graphs. And we proposed an ego-graph decoder
that can achieve a good trade-off between simulation quality and efficiency in
temporal graph generation. Finally, the experimental evaluation is conducted
among our proposed TGAE and representative temporal graph generators on
real-life temporal graphs and synthesized graphs. It is reported that our
proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art temporal graph generators by
means of simulation quality and efficiency.

Result: 仅需一轮隐私通信，客户端计算量更少，嵌入适用于多种服务器模型。

Conclusion: 该方法在隐私保护和计算效率上优于传统方法。

Abstract: Traditional collaborative learning approaches are based on sharing of model
weights between clients and a server. However, there are advantages to resource
efficiency through schemes based on sharing of embeddings (activations) created
from the data. Several differentially private methods were developed for
sharing of weights while such mechanisms do not exist so far for sharing of
embeddings. We propose Ours to learn a privacy encoding network in conjunction
with a small utility generation network such that the final embeddings
generated from it are equipped with formal differential privacy guarantees.
These privatized embeddings are then shared with a more powerful server, that
learns a post-processing that results in a higher accuracy for machine learning
tasks. We show that our co-design of collaborative and private learning results
in requiring only one round of privatized communication and lesser compute on
the client than traditional methods. The privatized embeddings that we share
from the client are agnostic to the type of model (deep learning, random
forests or XGBoost) used on the server in order to process these activations to
complete a task.

Result: InfoRMIA在基准测试中优于RMIA，且令牌级分析能更精确地识别泄露的令牌。

Conclusion: 令牌级分析为LLM隐私研究提供了新视角，有助于更精准的隐私缓解措施。

Abstract: Machine learning models are known to leak sensitive information, as they
inevitably memorize (parts of) their training data. More alarmingly, large
language models (LLMs) are now trained on nearly all available data, which
amplifies the magnitude of information leakage and raises serious privacy
risks. Hence, it is more crucial than ever to quantify privacy risk before the
release of LLMs. The standard method to quantify privacy is via membership
inference attacks, where the state-of-the-art approach is the Robust Membership
Inference Attack (RMIA). In this paper, we present InfoRMIA, a principled
information-theoretic formulation of membership inference. Our method
consistently outperforms RMIA across benchmarks while also offering improved
computational efficiency.
  In the second part of the paper, we identify the limitations of treating
sequence-level membership inference as the gold standard for measuring leakage.
We propose a new perspective for studying membership and memorization in LLMs:
token-level signals and analyses. We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA
can pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby
localizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while
achieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope
rethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as

*Arindam Chowdhury,Massimiliano Lupo Pasini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一的基准测试框架，用于评估图神经网络（GNNs）中全局注意力机制的有效性，并比较了不同模型类别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决当前GNNs中全局注意力机制与消息传递神经网络（MPNNs）层在建模原子尺度行为时效果不一致的问题。

Method: 方法是通过HydraGNN框架，设计了四种可控模型类别（MPNN、MPNN+编码器、GPS混合模型、融合局部-全局模型），并在七个数据集上进行系统评估。

Result: 结果显示，编码器增强的MPNNs是稳健的基线模型，而融合局部-全局模型在长程相互作用主导的任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: 结论是全局注意力机制在特定任务中有优势，但需权衡计算开销，研究为未来模型开发提供了可复现的测试平台。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely used as surrogates for costly
experiments and first-principles simulations to study the behavior of compounds
at atomistic scale, and their architectural complexity is constantly increasing
to enable the modeling of complex physics. While most recent GNNs combine more
traditional message passing neural networks (MPNNs) layers to model short-range
interactions with more advanced graph transformers (GTs) with global attention
mechanisms to model long-range interactions, it is still unclear when global
attention mechanisms provide real benefits over well-tuned MPNN layers due to
inconsistent implementations, features, or hyperparameter tuning. We introduce
the first unified, reproducible benchmarking framework - built on HydraGNN -
that enables seamless switching among four controlled model classes: MPNN, MPNN
with chemistry/topology encoders, GPS-style hybrids of MPNN with global
attention, and fully fused local - global models with encoders. Using seven
diverse open-source datasets for benchmarking across regression and
classification tasks, we systematically isolate the contributions of message
passing, global attention, and encoder-based feature augmentation. Our study
shows that encoder-augmented MPNNs form a robust baseline, while fused
local-global models yield the clearest benefits for properties governed by
long-range interaction effects. We further quantify the accuracy - compute
trade-offs of attention, reporting its overhead in memory. Together, these
results establish the first controlled evaluation of global attention in
atomistic graph learning and provide a reproducible testbed for future model
development.

TL;DR: TimePD是一个源自由的时间序列预测框架，通过代理去噪和LLMs的泛化能力，解决了源数据不可访问的领域适应问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在源数据不可访问的情况下，将预训练模型从源时间序列适应到稀疏目标时间序列的问题，同时遵守数据保护法规。

Method: TimePD包含三个关键组件：双分支不变解耦特征学习、轻量级代理去噪和知识蒸馏。

Result: 在真实数据集上，TimePD平均优于现有基线方法9.3%。

Conclusion: TimePD通过创新的方法有效解决了源自由时间序列预测问题，展示了其在实际应用中的潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of mobile devices generates a massive volume of time series
across various domains, where effective time series forecasting enables a
variety of real-world applications. This study focuses on a new problem of
source-free domain adaptation for time series forecasting. It aims to adapt a
pretrained model from sufficient source time series to the sparse target time
series domain without access to the source data, embracing data protection
regulations. To achieve this, we propose TimePD, the first source-free time
series forecasting framework with proxy denoising, where large language models
(LLMs) are employed to benefit from their generalization capabilities.
Specifically, TimePD consists of three key components: (1) dual-branch
invariant disentangled feature learning that enforces representation- and
gradient-wise invariance by means of season-trend decomposition; (2)
lightweight, parameter-free proxy denoising that dynamically calibrates
systematic biases of LLMs; and (3) knowledge distillation that bidirectionally
aligns the denoised prediction and the original target prediction. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets offer insight into the effectiveness of the
proposed TimePD, outperforming SOTA baselines by 9.3% on average.

TL;DR: 深度学习存在根本的可预测性限制，源于其吸引盆的复杂分形几何结构，导致初始条件的微小变化可能导致完全不同的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习中的可预测性限制，揭示其吸引盆的复杂几何结构如何影响训练结果的稳定性和可重复性。

Method: 通过分析深度学习中的混沌学习动力学和对称性诱导的不变子空间，推导出吸引盆出现复杂分形结构的充分条件。

Conclusion: 深度学习中的吸引盆复杂性限制了训练结果的可预测性和可重复性，这对优化和AI安全部署具有重要意义。

Abstract: Fundamental limits to predictability are central to our understanding of many
physical and computational systems. Here we show that, despite its remarkable
capabilities, deep learning exhibits such fundamental limits rooted in the
fractal, riddled geometry of its basins of attraction: any initialization that
leads to one solution lies arbitrarily close to another that leads to a
different one. We derive sufficient conditions for the emergence of riddled
basins by analytically linking features widely observed in deep learning,
including chaotic learning dynamics and symmetry-induced invariant subspaces,
to reveal a general route to riddling in realistic deep networks. The resulting
basins of attraction possess an infinitely fine-scale fractal structure
characterized by an uncertainty exponent near zero, so that even large
increases in the precision of initial conditions yield only marginal gains in
outcome predictability. Riddling thus imposes a fundamental limit on the
predictability and hence reproducibility of neural network training, providing
a unified account of many empirical observations. These results reveal a
general organizing principle of deep learning with important implications for
optimization and the safe deployment of artificial intelligence.

TL;DR: MCNO提出了一种通过蒙特卡洛方法学习一维PDE解算子的框架，无需依赖谱表示或平移不变性假设，具有高效计算和跨分辨率泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如FNO依赖谱表示和固定核假设，MCNO旨在提供更灵活且理论支持的替代方案。

Method: 通过可学习张量表示核函数，采用蒙特卡洛估计积分算子，支持单次采样和插值映射。

Result: 在标准1D PDE基准测试中表现竞争性，理论分析证明其估计偏差和方差有界。

Conclusion: MCNO为连续域PDE提供了一种基于蒙特卡洛的神经算子框架，可扩展至高维问题。

Abstract: The Monte Carlo-type Neural Operator (MCNO) introduces a framework for
learning solution operators of one-dimensional partial differential equations
(PDEs) by directly learning the kernel function and approximating the
associated integral operator using a Monte Carlo-type approach. Unlike Fourier
Neural Operators (FNOs), which rely on spectral representations and assume
translation-invariant kernels, MCNO makes no such assumptions. The kernel is
represented as a learnable tensor over sampled input-output pairs, and sampling
is performed once, uniformly at random from a discretized grid. This design
enables generalization across multiple grid resolutions without relying on
fixed global basis functions or repeated sampling during training, while an
interpolation step maps between arbitrary input and output grids to further
enhance flexibility. Experiments on standard 1D PDE benchmarks show that MCNO
achieves competitive accuracy with efficient computational cost. We also
provide a theoretical analysis proving that the Monte Carlo estimator yields a
bounded bias and variance under mild regularity assumptions. This result holds
in any spatial dimension, suggesting that MCNO may extend naturally beyond
one-dimensional problems. More broadly, this work explores how Monte Carlo-type
integration can be incorporated into neural operator frameworks for
continuous-domain PDEs, providing a theoretically supported alternative to
spectral methods (such as FNO) and to graph-based Monte Carlo approaches (such
as the Graph Kernel Neural Operator, GNO).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NEO是一种无需超参数、计算成本低的测试时适应方法，通过重新定位目标数据嵌入到原点，显著提升分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有测试时适应方法计算成本高、数据需求大或对超参数敏感的问题。

Method: 基于潜在空间几何理论，将目标数据嵌入重新定位到原点。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上显著提升准确率，减少计算时间和内存使用。

Conclusion: NEO是一种高效且有效的测试时适应方法。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods are often computationally expensive,
require a large amount of data for effective adaptation, or are brittle to
hyperparameters. Based on a theoretical foundation of the geometry of the
latent space, we are able to significantly improve the alignment between source
and distribution-shifted samples by re-centering target data embeddings at the
origin. This insight motivates NEO -- a hyperparameter-free fully TTA method,
that adds no significant compute compared to vanilla inference. NEO is able to
improve the classification accuracy of ViT-Base on ImageNet-C from 55.6% to
59.2% after adapting on just one batch of 64 samples. When adapting on 512
samples NEO beats all 7 TTA methods we compare against on ImageNet-C,
ImageNet-R and ImageNet-S and beats 6/7 on CIFAR-10-C, while using the least
amount of compute. NEO performs well on model calibration metrics and
additionally is able to adapt from 1 class to improve accuracy on 999 other
classes in ImageNet-C. On Raspberry Pi and Jetson Orin Nano devices, NEO
reduces inference time by 63% and memory usage by 9% compared to baselines. Our
results based on 3 ViT architectures and 4 datasets show that NEO can be used
efficiently and effectively for TTA.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的概念侧信道模型（CSMs）框架，通过侧信道独立性评分（SIS）和正则化方法，平衡模型的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念侧信道模型（CSMs）在提高准确性的同时牺牲了可解释性，缺乏一种原则性的方法来控制这种权衡。

Method: 提出了一个统一的概率概念侧信道元模型，引入侧信道独立性评分（SIS）和正则化方法，量化并减少对侧信道的依赖。

Result: 实验表明，仅追求准确性的CSMs可解释性较低，而SIS正则化显著提高了可解释性、干预性和任务预测质量。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发平衡准确性和可解释性的CSMs提供了理论和实践工具。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBNMs) are deep learning models that provide
interpretability by enforcing a bottleneck layer where predictions are based
exclusively on human-understandable concepts. However, this constraint also
restricts information flow and often results in reduced predictive accuracy.
Concept Sidechannel Models (CSMs) address this limitation by introducing a
sidechannel that bypasses the bottleneck and carry additional task-relevant
information. While this improves accuracy, it simultaneously compromises
interpretability, as predictions may rely on uninterpretable representations
transmitted through sidechannels. Currently, there exists no principled
technique to control this fundamental trade-off. In this paper, we close this
gap. First, we present a unified probabilistic concept sidechannel meta-model
that subsumes existing CSMs as special cases. Building on this framework, we
introduce the Sidechannel Independence Score (SIS), a metric that quantifies a
CSM's reliance on its sidechannel by contrasting predictions made with and
without sidechannel information. We propose SIS regularization, which
explicitly penalizes sidechannel reliance to improve interpretability. Finally,
we analyze how the expressivity of the predictor and the reliance of the
sidechannel jointly shape interpretability, revealing inherent trade-offs
across different CSM architectures. Empirical results show that
state-of-the-art CSMs, when trained solely for accuracy, exhibit low
representation interpretability, and that SIS regularization substantially
improves their interpretability, intervenability, and the quality of learned
interpretable task predictors. Our work provides both theoretical and practical
tools for developing CSMs that balance accuracy and interpretability in a
principled manner.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的归纳图梯度提升机（G-GBM），用于处理异构和动态图的监督学习，并在保险欺诈检测中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈数据存在高类别不平衡和动态异构网络特性，传统图方法难以有效建模，而基于表格数据的梯度提升树方法仍占主导。

Method: 开发了G-GBM，结合了梯度提升树的优势和图结构信息，适用于异构和动态图。

Result: 在模拟随机图和真实保险欺诈数据上，G-GBM与流行的图神经网络方法竞争，并提供了可解释性。

Conclusion: G-GBM在保险欺诈检测中表现出色，且通过梯度提升树的特性提供了更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Graph-based methods are becoming increasingly popular in machine learning due
to their ability to model complex data and relations. Insurance fraud is a
prime use case, since false claims are often the result of organised criminals
that stage accidents or the same persons filing erroneous claims on multiple
policies. One challenge is that graph-based approaches struggle to find
meaningful representations of the data because of the high class imbalance
present in fraud data. Another is that insurance networks are heterogeneous and
dynamic, given the changing relations among people, companies and policies.
That is why gradient boosted tree approaches on tabular data still dominate the
field. Therefore, we present a novel inductive graph gradient boosting machine
(G-GBM) for supervised learning on heterogeneous and dynamic graphs. We show
that our estimator competes with popular graph neural network approaches in an
experiment using a variety of simulated random graphs. We demonstrate the power
of G-GBM for insurance fraud detection using an open-source and a real-world,
proprietary dataset. Given that the backbone model is a gradient boosting
forest, we apply established explainability methods to gain better insights
into the predictions made by G-GBM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子图神经网络的可解释性受到测量诱导的随机性和图结构的组合性质的限制，需要一种新的解释方法。

Method: QGraphLIME通过拟合结构保留扰动下的局部替代模型，将模型解释视为分布，并利用Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz边界提供有限样本保证。

Result: 在合成图上的实验表明，该方法能生成准确且稳定的解释，非线性替代建模和扰动设计对结果有显著影响。

Conclusion: QGraphLIME为量子图神经网络提供了一种原则性、不确定性感知且结构敏感的解释方法，为未来扩展到更广泛架构和真实数据集奠定了基础。

Abstract: Quantum graph neural networks offer a powerful paradigm for learning on
graph-structured data, yet their explainability is complicated by
measurement-induced stochasticity and the combinatorial nature of graph
structure. In this paper, we introduce QuantumGraphLIME (QGraphLIME), a
model-agnostic, post-hoc framework that treats model explanations as
distributions over local surrogates fit on structure-preserving perturbations
of a graph. By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their
dispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance
rankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a
distribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate
ensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of
the induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and
confidence under standard independence assumptions. Empirical studies on
controlled synthetic graphs with known ground truth demonstrate accurate and
stable explanations, with ablations showing clear benefits of nonlinear
surrogate modeling and highlighting sensitivity to perturbation design.
Collectively, these results establish a principled, uncertainty-aware, and
structure-sensitive approach to explaining quantum graph neural networks, and
lay the groundwork for scaling to broader architectures and real-world
datasets, as quantum resources mature. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有稀疏注意力方法（如top-k和随机采样）在近似全注意力时存在局限性，缺乏一致性近似和质量保证。

Method: 结合top-k和随机采样的优势，引入vAttention机制，提供统计保证的近似精度。

Result: vAttention显著提升稀疏注意力质量（如4.5个百分点），并在推理场景中实现快速解码且不损失模型质量。

Conclusion: vAttention是迈向实用、可靠稀疏注意力部署的重要一步，提供优越的质量-效率权衡。

Abstract: State-of-the-art sparse attention methods for reducing decoding latency fall
into two main categories: approximate top-$k$ (and its extension, top-$p$) and
recently introduced sampling-based estimation. However, these approaches are
fundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail
to provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most
critically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical
deployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:
top-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,
whereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are
relatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical
guarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse
attention mechanism with user-specified $(\epsilon, \delta)$ guarantees on
approximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a
compelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at
scale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both
individually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off. Our
experiments show that vAttention significantly improves the quality of sparse
attention (e.g., $\sim$4.5 percentage points for Llama-3.1-8B-Inst and
Deepseek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B on RULER-HARD), and effectively bridges the gap
between full and sparse attention (e.g., across datasets, it matches full model
quality with upto 20x sparsity). We also demonstrate that it can be deployed in
reasoning scenarios to achieve fast decoding without compromising model quality
(e.g., vAttention achieves full model quality on AIME2024 at 10x sparsity with
up to 32K token generations). Code is open-sourced at

Result: 理论保证和实验结果表明方法有效，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在约束对齐任务中表现优异，适用于在线数据设置。

Abstract: The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) imposes increasing
demands on safety, such as reducing harmful content and fake information, and
avoiding certain forbidden tokens due to rules and laws. While there have been
several recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either
require the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and
computational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.
Motivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,
i.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to
potentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we
propose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using
standard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then
adopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward
information to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach
significantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require
extra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees
on the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also
extend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration
bonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,
and then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on
preference data coverage. Experimental results on the widely-used preference
dataset PKU-SafeRLHF demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Result: 在多种真实数据基准测试中，DiffSDA优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: DiffSDA为序列解缠提供了一种高效且模态无关的解决方案，适用于真实数据场景。

Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning, particularly sequential
disentanglement, aims to separate static and dynamic factors of variation in
data without relying on labels. This remains a challenging problem, as existing
approaches based on variational autoencoders and generative adversarial
networks often rely on multiple loss terms, complicating the optimization
process. Furthermore, sequential disentanglement methods face challenges when
applied to real-world data, and there is currently no established evaluation
protocol for assessing their performance in such settings. Recently, diffusion
models have emerged as state-of-the-art generative models, but no theoretical
formalization exists for their application to sequential disentanglement. In
this work, we introduce the Diffusion Sequential Disentanglement Autoencoder
(DiffSDA), a novel, modal-agnostic framework effective across diverse
real-world data modalities, including time series, video, and audio. DiffSDA
leverages a new probabilistic modeling, latent diffusion, and efficient
samplers, while incorporating a challenging evaluation protocol for rigorous
testing. Our experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that
DiffSDA outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods in sequential
disentanglement.

Conclusion: NGLGE通过自适应学习和多模式挖掘，显著提升了图嵌入的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Graph embedding has been widely applied in areas such as network analysis,
social network mining, recommendation systems, and bioinformatics. However,
current graph construction methods often require the prior definition of
neighborhood size, limiting the effective revelation of potential structural
correlations in the data. Additionally, graph embedding methods using linear
projection heavily rely on a singular pattern mining approach, resulting in
relative weaknesses in adapting to different scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel model, Neighborhood-Adaptive Generalized Linear
Graph Embedding (NGLGE), grounded in latent pattern mining. This model
introduces an adaptive graph learning method tailored to the neighborhood,
effectively revealing intrinsic data correlations. Simultaneously, leveraging a
reconstructed low-rank representation and imposing $\ell_{2,0}$ norm constraint
on the projection matrix allows for flexible exploration of additional pattern
information. Besides, an efficient iterative solving algorithm is derived for
the proposed model. Comparative evaluations on datasets from diverse scenarios
demonstrate the superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

Result: 在四个基准测试中，学习策略优于启发式方法，如SUDOKU任务提升11.2%。

Conclusion: 学习调度器能更匹配数据分布，显著提升MDM性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have recently emerged as a novel framework for
language modeling. MDMs generate sentences by iteratively denoising masked
sequences, filling in [MASK] tokens step by step. Although MDMs support
any-order sampling, performance is highly sensitive to the choice of which
position to unmask next. Prior work typically relies on rule-based schedules
(e.g., max-confidence, max-margin), which provide ad hoc improvements. In
contrast, we replace these heuristics with a learned scheduler. Specifically,
we cast denoising as a KL-regularized Markov decision process (MDP) with an
explicit reference policy and optimize a regularized objective that admits
policy improvement and convergence guarantees under standard assumptions. We
prove that the optimized policy under this framework generates samples that
more closely match the data distribution than heuristic schedules. Empirically,
across four benchmarks, our learned policy consistently outperforms
max-confidence: for example, on SUDOKU, where unmasking order is critical, it
yields a 20.1% gain over random and a 11.2% gain over max-confidence.

Abstract: Eliciting cooperation in multi-agent LLM systems is critical for AI
alignment. We investigate two approaches: direct communication and curriculum
learning. In a 4-player Stag Hunt, a one-word "cheap talk" channel increases
cooperation from 0% to 48.3%, demonstrating communication as a robust
coordination mechanism. In contrast, we find that curriculum learning is highly
sensitive to design choices: our pedagogical curriculum through progressively
complex games reduced agent payoffs by 27.4% in an Iterated Public Goods Game
with Punishment. Qualitative analysis reveals that curricula emphasizing
defection-equilibrium games can induce "learned pessimism" in agents. These
findings suggest that for coordination problems, simple communication protocols
may be more reliable than experience-based training, and that curriculum design
for social dilemmas requires careful attention to the strategic lessons
embedded in game sequences.

Conclusion: HGNNs的性能提升主要源于异构信息，而非模型架构，为未来研究提供了明确方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node
classification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks
(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage
heterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,
aiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,
whether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most
studies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this
work, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and
heterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21
datasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter
retuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a
causal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate
factors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,
with robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method
consistency checks, and sensitivity analyses. Our results lead to two
conclusions. First, model architecture and complexity have no causal effect on
performance. Second, heterogeneous information exerts a positive causal effect
by increasing homophily and local-global distribution discrepancy, which makes
node classes more distinguishable. The implementation is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估迁移学习模型中的隐私风险，填补现有研究中攻击方法覆盖不足的空白。

Method: 比较多种MIAs在迁移学习场景下的性能，包括LiRA和IHA。

Result: 攻击效果随数据量增加而降低；LiRA表现最佳，但IHA在高数据量下更有效。

Conclusion: 需结合多种攻击方法评估隐私风险，LiRA和IHA在不同场景下各有优势。

Abstract: With the emergence of powerful large-scale foundation models, the training
paradigm is increasingly shifting from from-scratch training to transfer
learning. This enables high utility training with small, domain-specific
datasets typical in sensitive applications.Membership inference attacks (MIAs)
provide an empirical estimate of the privacy leakage by machine learning
models. Yet, prior assessments of MIAs against models fine-tuned with transfer
learning rely on a small subset of possible attacks. We address this by
comparing performance of diverse MIAs in transfer learning settings to help
practitioners identify the most efficient attacks for privacy risk evaluation.
We find that attack efficacy decreases with the increase in training data for
score-based MIAs. We find that there is no one MIA which captures all privacy
risks in models trained with transfer learning. While the Likelihood Ratio
Attack (LiRA) demonstrates superior performance across most experimental
scenarios, the Inverse Hessian Attack (IHA) proves to be more effective against
models fine-tuned on PatchCamelyon dataset in high data regime.

*Shadi Rahimian,Mario Fritz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间非齐次隐马尔可夫模型（TIHMMs）的合成SNP序列生成框架，通过限制每个SNP序列的梯度贡献，确保强差分隐私保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNP数据集在遗传研究中至关重要，但共享时存在隐私风险，现有方法要么仅适用于统计摘要，要么需要复杂后处理。

Method: 使用TIHMMs生成合成SNP序列，限制序列的梯度贡献以实现差分隐私，并允许转移模型依赖序列位置。

Result: 在1000 Genomes数据集上验证，隐私预算ε∈[1,10]时，合成数据能有效复制非私有数据的统计特性。

Conclusion: 该框架在保护隐私的同时，为基因组数据共享提供了灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) datasets are fundamental to genetic
studies but pose significant privacy risks when shared. The correlation of SNPs
with each other makes strong adversarial attacks such as masked-value
reconstruction, kin, and membership inference attacks possible. Existing
privacy-preserving approaches either apply differential privacy to statistical
summaries of these datasets or offer complex methods that require
post-processing and the usage of a publicly available dataset to suppress or
selectively share SNPs.
  In this study, we introduce an innovative framework for generating synthetic
SNP sequence datasets using samples derived from time-inhomogeneous hidden
Markov models (TIHMMs). To preserve the privacy of the training data, we ensure
that each SNP sequence contributes only a bounded influence during training,
enabling strong differential privacy guarantees. Crucially, by operating on
full SNP sequences and bounding their gradient contributions, our method
directly addresses the privacy risks introduced by their inherent correlations.
  Through experiments conducted on the real-world 1000 Genomes dataset, we
demonstrate the efficacy of our method using privacy budgets of $\varepsilon
\in [1, 10]$ at $\delta=10^{-4}$. Notably, by allowing the transition models of
the HMM to be dependent on the location in the sequence, we significantly
enhance performance, enabling the synthetic datasets to closely replicate the
statistical properties of non-private datasets. This framework facilitates the
private sharing of genomic data while offering researchers exceptional
flexibility and utility.

Motivation: 传统的数据集压缩方法使用SGD轨迹作为对齐目标，但轨迹噪声大、存储开销高，导致梯度不稳定和收敛慢。

Method: 使用平滑的低损失参数化替代（二次贝塞尔曲线）连接初始和最终模型状态，提供无噪声、低曲率的监督信号。

Result: 在五个临床数据集上优于现有方法，生成的压缩数据集支持高效模型开发。

Conclusion: 贝塞尔模式连接是一种高效且稳定的数据集压缩方法，适用于临床数据。

Abstract: Dataset condensation (DC) enables the creation of compact, privacy-preserving
synthetic datasets that can match the utility of real patient records,
supporting democratised access to highly regulated clinical data for developing
downstream clinical models. State-of-the-art DC methods supervise synthetic
data by aligning the training dynamics of models trained on real and those
trained on synthetic data, typically using full stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) trajectories as alignment targets; however, these trajectories are often
noisy, high-curvature, and storage-intensive, leading to unstable gradients,
slow convergence, and substantial memory overhead. We address these limitations
by replacing full SGD trajectories with smooth, low-loss parametric surrogates,
specifically quadratic B\'ezier curves that connect the initial and final model
states from real training trajectories. These mode-connected paths provide
noise-free, low-curvature supervision signals that stabilise gradients,
accelerate convergence, and eliminate the need for dense trajectory storage. We
theoretically justify B\'ezier-mode connections as effective surrogates for SGD
paths and empirically show that the proposed method outperforms
state-of-the-art condensation approaches across five clinical datasets,
yielding condensed datasets that enable clinically effective model development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统粒子滤波在过程奖励模型引导下容易过早收敛，导致粒子贫化，影响推理质量。

Method: 提出ePF算法，结合熵退火（EA）动态调整重采样分布，以及前瞻调制（LaM）评估状态潜力。

Result: 在多个数学基准测试中，ePF显著优于基线，任务奖励提升高达50%。

Conclusion: ePF通过平衡探索与利用，提高了粒子滤波的鲁棒性，生成更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Inference-Time Scaling (ITS) improves language models by allocating more
computation at generation time. Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong
ITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when
guided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early
in the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:
it myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially
correct hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,
known as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained
computational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two
root causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident
resampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning
path. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that
integrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,
Entropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by
monitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by
dynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The
second, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive
guide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several
challenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and
achieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward. Together, these
methods improve PF's resilience by balancing the exploration of diverse
solution spaces with the exploitation of high-reward regions, ultimately
leading to higher-quality solutions.

Motivation: 解决传统方法因固定长度轨迹表示导致的信息丢失或冗余问题，以及多源异构数据和复杂交通动态的挑战。

Method: 提出MDTI框架，使用模态特定编码器和跨模态交互模块捕捉空间、时间和拓扑语义，动态建模机制调节信息密度，结合自监督预训练目标。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上实验表明，MDTI优于现有基线方法，具有鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Conclusion: MDTI通过多模态动态轨迹集成有效提升旅行时间估计精度，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate travel time estimation (TTE) plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems. However, it remains challenging due to heterogeneous
data sources and complex traffic dynamics. Moreover, conventional approaches
typically convert trajectories into fixed-length representations, neglecting
the inherent variability of real-world trajectories, which often leads to
information loss or feature redundancy. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces the Multimodal Dynamic Trajectory Integration (MDTI) framework--a
novel multimodal trajectory representation learning approach that integrates
GPS sequences, grid trajectories, and road network constraints to enhance TTE
accuracy. MDTI employs modality-specific encoders and a cross-modal interaction
module to capture complementary spatial, temporal, and topological semantics,
while a dynamic trajectory modeling mechanism adaptively regulates information
density for trajectories of varying lengths. Two self-supervised pretraining
objectives, named contrastive alignment and masked language modeling, further
strengthen multimodal consistency and contextual understanding. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that MDTI consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, confirming its robustness and strong
generalization abilities. The code is publicly available at:

Abstract: Guiding pretrained flow-based generative models for conditional generation or

that leverages the typically Gaussian prior of the source distribution in
flow-based models to perform Bayesian inference directly in the source space
using Elliptical Slice Sampling. ESS-Flow only requires forward passes through
the generative model and observation process, no gradient or Jacobian
computations, and is applicable even when gradients are unreliable or
unavailable, such as with simulation-based observations or quantization in the
generation or observation process. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
designing materials with desired target properties and predicting protein
structures from sparse inter-residue distance measurements.

Abstract: This paper studies forecasting of the future distribution of events in human
action sequences, a task essential in domains like retail, finance, healthcare,
and recommendation systems where the precise temporal order is often less
critical than the set of outcomes. We challenge the dominant autoregressive
paradigm and investigate whether explicitly modeling the future distribution or
order-invariant multi-token approaches outperform order-preserving methods. We
analyze local order invariance and introduce a KL-based metric to quantify
temporal drift. We find that a simple explicit distribution forecasting
objective consistently surpasses complex implicit baselines. We further
demonstrate that mode collapse of predicted categories is primarily driven by
distributional imbalance. This work provides a principled framework for
selecting modeling strategies and offers practical guidance for building more
accurate and robust forecasting systems.

Result: MaNGO在多个动态预测任务中表现优于现有GNS方法，对未见过的材料属性接近oracle模型的准确性。

Conclusion: MaNGO通过元学习有效解决了数据驱动方法在物理参数变化时的适应性问题，显著提升了效率和准确性。

Abstract: Accurately simulating physics is crucial across scientific domains, with
applications spanning from robotics to materials science. While traditional
mesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive
and require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties. In
contrast, data-driven approaches like Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer
faster inference but suffer from two key limitations: Firstly, they must be
retrained from scratch for even minor variations in physical parameters, and
secondly they require labor-intensive data collection for each new parameter
setting. This is inefficient, as simulations with varying parameters often
share a common underlying latent structure. In this work, we address these
challenges by learning this shared structure through meta-learning, enabling
fast adaptation to new physical parameters without retraining. To this end, we
propose a novel architecture that generates a latent representation by encoding
graph trajectories using conditional neural processes (CNPs). To mitigate error
accumulation over time, we combine CNPs with a novel neural operator
architecture. We validate our approach, Meta Neural Graph Operator (MaNGO), on
several dynamics prediction tasks with varying material properties,
demonstrating superior performance over existing GNS methods. Notably, MaNGO
achieves accuracy on unseen material properties close to that of an oracle
model.

Abstract: GeoAI is evolving rapidly, fueled by diverse geospatial datasets like traffic
patterns, environmental data, and crowdsourced OpenStreetMap (OSM) information.
While sophisticated AI models are being developed, existing benchmarks are
often concentrated on single tasks and restricted to a single modality. As
such, progress in GeoAI is limited by the lack of a standardized, multi-task,
modality-agnostic benchmark for their systematic evaluation. This paper
introduces a novel benchmark designed to assess the performance, accuracy, and
efficiency of geospatial embedders. Our benchmark is modality-agnostic and
comprises 7 distinct datasets from diverse cities across three continents,
ensuring generalizability and mitigating demographic biases. It allows for the
evaluation of GeoAI embedders on various phenomena that exhibit underlying
geographic processes. Furthermore, we establish a simple and intuitive
task-oriented model baselines, providing a crucial reference point for
comparing more complex solutions.

Method: 结合潜在空间预测和抗崩溃目标训练JEPAs，利用模型Jacobian矩阵高效计算样本概率。

Result: JEPA-SCORE在多种数据集和模型（如I-JEPA、DINOv2、MetaCLIP）中验证了其密度估计能力。

Conclusion: JEPAs的抗崩溃目标具有数据密度估计功能，JEPA-SCORE为数据管理和异常检测提供了新工具。

Abstract: Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (JEPAs) learn representations able
to solve numerous downstream tasks out-of-the-box. JEPAs combine two
objectives: (i) a latent-space prediction term, i.e., the representation of a
slightly perturbed sample must be predictable from the original sample's
representation, and (ii) an anti-collapse term, i.e., not all samples should
have the same representation. While (ii) is often considered as an obvious
remedy to representation collapse, we uncover that JEPAs' anti-collapse term
does much more--it provably estimates the data density. In short, any
successfully trained JEPA can be used to get sample probabilities, e.g., for
data curation, outlier detection, or simply for density estimation. Our
theoretical finding is agnostic of the dataset and architecture used--in any
case one can compute the learned probabilities of sample $x$ efficiently and in
closed-form using the model's Jacobian matrix at $x$. Our findings are
empirically validated across datasets (synthetic, controlled, and Imagenet) and
across different Self Supervised Learning methods falling under the JEPA family
(I-JEPA and DINOv2) and on multimodal models, such as MetaCLIP. We denote the
method extracting the JEPA learned density as {\bf JEPA-SCORE}.

Motivation: Transformer的二次计算复杂度限制了其扩展性，而现有混合线性化方法存在线性组件被忽略的问题。

Result: 方法在保持计算效率的同时恢复大部分基础模型性能，确保线性注意力的真正采用。

Conclusion: 提出的解决方案修复了混合转换中的性能归因问题，恢复了线性注意力的有效性。

Abstract: Transformers' quadratic computational complexity limits their scalability
despite remarkable performance. While linear attention reduces this to linear
complexity, pre-training such models from scratch remains, in most cases,
prohibitively expensive. Recent post-training linearisation methods convert
pre-trained Transformers to linear models efficiently, often using hybrid
approaches that combine linear attention with sliding-window softmax. We
identify a critical flaw: existing hybrid methods inadvertently bypass the
linear component, relying almost entirely on SWA. Component-level diagnostics
reveal this previously undetected behaviour stems from overlooked evaluation
practices on common-sense benchmarks. We propose three solutions to ensure
balanced component usage: (i) inference-time hybridisation of linear-only
conversions with sliding-window softmax; (ii) HedgeCATs, combining
attention-weight transfer with targeted LoRA fine-tuning; and (iii) Scheduled
Sliding-window Dropout (SSD), which stochastically suppresses the softmax
branch during training to prevent component collapse. Our methods maintain
computational efficiency while recovering most base model performance and
ensuring genuine linear attention adoption, restoring the validity of
performance attributions in hybrid conversions.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) is critical for
identifying deviations associated with cardiovascular disease. This work
presents a comparative analysis of three autoencoder-based architectures:
convolutional autoencoder (CAE), variational autoencoder with bidirectional
long short-term memory (VAE-BiLSTM), and VAE-BiLSTM with multi-head attention
(VAE-BiLSTM-MHA), for unsupervised anomaly detection in ECGs. To the best of
our knowledge, this study reports the first application of a VAE-BiLSTM-MHA
architecture to ECG anomaly detection. All models are trained on normal ECG
samples to reconstruct non-anomalous cardiac morphology and detect deviations
indicative of disease. Using a unified preprocessing and evaluation pipeline on
the public China Physiological Signal Challenge (CPSC) dataset, the
attention-augmented VAE achieves the best performance, with an AUPRC of 0.81
and a recall of 0.85 on the held-out test set, outperforming the other
architectures. To support clinical triage, this model is further integrated
into an interactive dashboard that visualizes anomaly localization. In
addition, a performance comparison with baseline models from the literature is
provided.

Conclusion: CDC-FM为生成模型提供了一种数学框架和可扩展算法，优化了泛化与记忆的平衡。

Abstract: Deep generative models often face a fundamental tradeoff: high sample quality
can come at the cost of memorisation, where the model reproduces training data
rather than generalising across the underlying data geometry. We introduce
Carr\'e du champ flow matching (CDC-FM), a generalisation of flow matching
(FM), that improves the quality-generalisation tradeoff by regularising the
probability path with a geometry-aware noise. Our method replaces the
homogeneous, isotropic noise in FM with a spatially varying, anisotropic
Gaussian noise whose covariance captures the local geometry of the latent data
manifold. We prove that this geometric noise can be optimally estimated from
the data and is scalable to large data. Further, we provide an extensive
experimental evaluation on diverse datasets (synthetic manifolds, point clouds,
single-cell genomics, animal motion capture, and images) as well as various
neural network architectures (MLPs, CNNs, and transformers). We demonstrate
that CDC-FM consistently offers a better quality-generalisation tradeoff. We
observe significant improvements over standard FM in data-scarce regimes and in
highly non-uniformly sampled datasets, which are often encountered in AI for
science applications. Our work provides a mathematical framework for studying
the interplay between data geometry, generalisation and memorisation in
generative models, as well as a robust and scalable algorithm that can be
readily integrated into existing flow matching pipelines.

Abstract: High-dimensional data remains a pervasive challenge in machine learning,
often undermining model interpretability and computational efficiency. While
Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise for dimensionality reduction
through feature selection, existing LLM-based approaches frequently lack
structured reasoning and transparent justification for their decisions. This
paper introduces LLM-FS-Agent, a novel multi-agent architecture designed for
interpretable and robust feature selection. The system orchestrates a
deliberative "debate" among multiple LLM agents, each assigned a specific role,
enabling collective evaluation of feature relevance and generation of detailed
justifications. We evaluate LLM-FS-Agent in the cybersecurity domain using the
CIC-DIAD 2024 IoT intrusion detection dataset and compare its performance
against strong baselines, including LLM-Select and traditional methods such as
PCA. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM-FS-Agent consistently achieves
superior or comparable classification performance while reducing downstream
training time by an average of 46% (statistically significant improvement, p =
0.028 for XGBoost). These findings highlight that the proposed deliberative
architecture enhances both decision transparency and computational efficiency,
establishing LLM-FS-Agent as a practical and reliable solution for real-world
applications.

Result: 在数学和通用推理基准测试中表现优于现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: 解码规则应基于正确性校准，而非仅依赖置信度，为LLMs的推理任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to complex tasks that
require extended reasoning. In such settings, models often benefit from diverse
chains-of-thought to arrive at multiple candidate solutions. This requires two
competing objectives: to inject enough stochasticity to explore multiple
reasoning chains, and to ensure sufficient accuracy and quality in each path.
Existing works pursue the first objective by increasing exploration at highly
uncertain steps with higher temperature or larger candidate token sets, while
others improve reliability by rejecting samples with low confidence
post-generation, implying that low confidence correlates with low answer
quality. These two lines of thought are in conflict, as they conflate different
sources of uncertainty. To resolve this, we argue that the decoding rule should
be calibrated by correctness, not confidence alone. We should sample from
tokens with higher estimated correctness, and reduce sampling where expected
correctness is low. We propose simple strategies that achieve this goal:
Greedy-Threshold makes sampling greedy at very low confidence steps.
Calibrated-TopK and Calibrated-epsilon set truncation threshold based on
estimated rank-wise correctness. Together, our findings challenge prevailing
heuristics about decoding under uncertainty and show gains across math and
general reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理知识的神经网络RamPINN，用于从CARS测量中恢复拉曼光谱，无需大规模真实数据训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学领域缺乏大规模训练数据，但已有科学理论可作为可靠的归纳偏置。

Method: 采用双解码器架构，通过可微希尔伯特变换损失和平滑性先验，强制满足Kramers-Kronig因果关系。

Result: RamPINN在合成数据上训练，零样本泛化到真实数据，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 科学规则可作为强大的归纳偏置，支持数据有限领域的自监督学习。

Abstract: Transferring the recent advancements in deep learning into scientific
disciplines is hindered by the lack of the required large-scale datasets for
training. We argue that in these knowledge-rich domains, the established body
of scientific theory provides reliable inductive biases in the form of
governing physical laws. We address the ill-posed inverse problem of recovering
Raman spectra from noisy Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS)
measurements, as the true Raman signal here is suppressed by a dominating
non-resonant background. We propose RamPINN, a model that learns to recover
Raman spectra from given CARS spectra. Our core methodological contribution is
a physics-informed neural network that utilizes a dual-decoder architecture to
disentangle resonant and non-resonant signals. This is done by enforcing the
Kramers-Kronig causality relations via a differentiable Hilbert transform loss
on the resonant and a smoothness prior on the non-resonant part of the signal.
Trained entirely on synthetic data, RamPINN demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world experimental data, explicitly closing this gap and
significantly outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, we show that
training with these physics-based losses alone, without access to any
ground-truth Raman spectra, still yields competitive results. This work
highlights a broader concept: formal scientific rules can act as a potent
inductive bias, enabling robust, self-supervised learning in data-limited
scientific domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯神经网络的后验OOD检测方法，在小样本训练数据下表现优于确定性方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OOD检测对AI可靠性和安全性至关重要，但实际场景中训练数据往往有限。贝叶斯神经网络能显式表示模型不确定性，适合小样本场景。

Method: 引入基于期望logit向量的贝叶斯后验OOD评分家族，比较了5种贝叶斯和4种确定性后验OOD评分。

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上，贝叶斯方法在小样本（≤5000）训练下优于确定性方法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯方法在小样本OOD检测中具有优势，尤其适合数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical to AI reliability and safety,
yet in many practical settings, only a limited amount of training data is
available. Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) are a promising class of model on
which to base OOD detection, because they explicitly represent epistemic (i.e.
model) uncertainty. In the small training data regime, BNNs are especially
valuable because they can incorporate prior model information. We introduce a
new family of Bayesian posthoc OOD scores based on expected logit vectors, and
compare 5 Bayesian and 4 deterministic posthoc OOD scores. Experiments on MNIST
and CIFAR-10 In-Distributions, with 5000 training samples or less, show that
the Bayesian methods outperform corresponding deterministic methods.

Motivation: 研究在过参数化插值区域中，Gibbs算法的泛化性能，尤其是在低训练误差情况下对不可能数据的处理能力。

Method: 使用Langevin Monte Carlo算法进行近似，并在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 界限在真实标签数据上提供了非平凡的预测，并正确上界了随机标签的测试误差。

Conclusion: 低温度插值区域的泛化性能可以通过高温度区域的小训练误差来预测。

Abstract: The paper provides data-dependent bounds on the test error of the Gibbs
algorithm in the overparameterized interpolation regime, where low training
errors are also obtained for impossible data, such as random labels in
classification. The bounds are stable under approximation with Langevin Monte
Carlo algorithms. Experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets verify that
the bounds yield nontrivial predictions on true labeled data and correctly
upper bound the test error for random labels. Our method indicates that
generalization in the low-temperature, interpolation regime is already signaled
by small training errors in the more classical high temperature regime.

Conclusion: molFTP是一种高效、抗泄漏的分子表示方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: We introduce molFTP (molecular fragment-target prevalence), a compact
representation that delivers strong predictive performance. To prevent feature
leakage across cross-validation folds, we implement a dummy-masking procedure
that removes information about fragments present in the held-out molecules. We
further show that key leave-one-out (key-loo) closely approximates true
molecule-level leave-one-out (LOO), with deviation below 8% on our datasets.
This enables near full data training while preserving unbiased cross-validation
estimates of model performance. Overall, molFTP provides a fast,
leakage-resistant fragment-target prevalence vectorization with practical
safeguards (dummy masking or key-LOO) that approximate LOO at a fraction of its
cost.

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中验证了方法的有效性，实现了安全、鲁棒且高效的自动驾驶策略学习。

Conclusion: H-DSAC方法通过人类引导显著提升了强化学习在自动驾驶中的实用性和安全性。

Abstract: Autonomous driving with reinforcement learning (RL) has significant
potential. However, applying RL in real-world settings remains challenging due
to the need for safe, efficient, and robust learning. Incorporating human
expertise into the learning process can help overcome these challenges by
reducing risky exploration and improving sample efficiency. In this work, we
propose a reward-free, active human-in-the-loop learning method called
Human-Guided Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (H-DSAC). Our method combines
Proxy Value Propagation (PVP) and Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC) to
enable efficient and safe training in real-world environments. The key
innovation is the construction of a distributed proxy value function within the
DSAC framework. This function encodes human intent by assigning higher expected
returns to expert demonstrations and penalizing actions that require human
intervention. By extrapolating these labels to unlabeled states, the policy is
effectively guided toward expert-like behavior. With a well-designed state
space, our method achieves real-world driving policy learning within practical
training times. Results from both simulation and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our framework enables safe, robust, and sample-efficient
learning for autonomous driving.

TL;DR: BLISS是一种轻量级数据选择方法，无需依赖外部预训练模型，通过双层优化和代理模型评估数据长期影响，显著提升LLM预训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法依赖外部预训练模型，难以分离数据选择效果与外部模型影响，且忽略数据长期影响。BLISS旨在解决这些问题。

Method: BLISS使用代理模型和评分模型，通过双层优化问题分配样本权重，预测数据长期影响，从而高效选择高质量样本。

Result: 在1B模型设置下，BLISS达到1.7倍加速，性能优于现有方法，并在多个下游任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BLISS是一种高效、独立的数据选择方法，显著提升LLM预训练速度和性能。

Abstract: Effective data selection is essential for pretraining large language models
(LLMs), enhancing efficiency and improving generalization to downstream tasks.
However, existing approaches often require leveraging external pretrained
models, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of data selection from
those of the external pretrained models. In addition, they often overlook the
long-term impact of selected data if the model is trained to convergence,
primarily due to the prohibitive cost of full-scale LLM pretraining. In this
paper, we introduce BLISS (\textbf{B}ileve\textbf{L} \textbf{I}nfluence
\textbf{S}coring method for data \textbf{S}election): a lightweight data
selection method that operates entirely \emph{from scratch}, without relying on
any external pretrained oracle models, while explicitly accounting for the
long-term impact of selected data. BLISS leverages a small proxy model as a
surrogate for the LLM and employs a score model to estimate the long-term
influence of training samples if the proxy model is trained to convergence. We
formulate data selection as a bilevel optimization problem, where the
upper-level objective optimizes the score model to assign importance weights to
training samples, ensuring that minimizing the lower-level objective (i.e.,
training the proxy model over the weighted training loss until convergence)
leads to best validation performance. Once optimized, the trained score model
predicts influence scores for the dataset, enabling efficient selection of
high-quality samples for LLM pretraining. We validate BLISS by pretraining
410M/1B/2.8B Pythia and LLaMA-0.5B models on selected subsets of the C4
dataset. Notably, under the 1B model setting, BLISS achieves $1.7\times$
speedup in reaching the same performance as the state-of-the-art method,
demonstrating superior performance across multiple downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归方法在时序点过程建模中存在采样效率低的问题，扩散模型虽有所改进但仍需进一步优化。

Method: 通过插入、删除和替换操作，在连续时间马尔可夫链框架中学习瞬时编辑速率，减少生成所需的编辑操作。

Result: 实验表明，该模型在无条件生成和条件生成任务中均表现出较高的生成灵活性。

Conclusion: Edit Flow模型通过编辑操作有效提升了时序点过程的生成效率和灵活性。

Abstract: Temporal point processes (TPPs) are a fundamental tool for modeling event
sequences in continuous time, but most existing approaches rely on
autoregressive parameterizations that are limited by their sequential sampling.
Recent non-autoregressive, diffusion-style models mitigate these issues by
jointly interpolating between noise and data through event insertions and
deletions in a discrete Markov chain. In this work, we generalize this
perspective and introduce an Edit Flow process for TPPs that transports noise
to data via insert, delete, and substitute edit operations. By learning the
instantaneous edit rates within a continuous-time Markov chain framework, we
attain a flexible and efficient model that effectively reduces the total number
of necessary edit operations during generation. Empirical results demonstrate
the generative flexibility of our unconditionally trained model in a wide range
of unconditional and conditional generation tasks on benchmark TPPs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度图神经网络（GNN）中过平滑效应的成因及其影响，以改进模型性能。

Method: 提出MASED指标量化过平滑，分析节点嵌入范数和权重矩阵奇异值，并设计G-Reg正则化方案。

Result: 实验表明G-Reg能提升节点分类准确性，尤其在深度网络中表现更优，且在“冷启动”场景下效果显著。

Conclusion: 通过MASED指标和G-Reg方案，有效缓解了GNN中的过平滑问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the factors that contribute to the effect of
oversmoothing in deep Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Specifically, our analysis
is based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify
the extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which
aggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this
quantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two
different properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node
embeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight
matrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show
that oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the
number of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise
bounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,
adjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we
introduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and
demonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification
accuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that
by reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in
some tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold
start" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled
nodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size
(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.
This is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of
trainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of
the GNN.

Motivation: 现有基准测试很少涉及散点图特定任务，限制了对其性能的理解。

Method: 使用合成数据集（18,000+散点图）和N-shot提示法评估模型在五个任务上的表现。

Result: OpenAI模型和Gemini 2.5 Flash在聚类计数和异常值识别上表现良好（90%+准确率），但定位任务表现不佳（精确率和召回率低于50%）。

Conclusion: 散点图设计对性能影响较小，但应避免宽高比过大或随机着色的设计。

Abstract: AI models are increasingly used for data analysis and visualization, yet
benchmarks rarely address scatterplot-specific tasks, limiting insight into
performance. To address this gap for one of the most common chart types, we
introduce a synthetic, annotated dataset of over 18,000 scatterplots from six
data generators and 17 chart designs, and a benchmark based on it. We evaluate
proprietary models from OpenAI and Google using N-shot prompting on five
distinct tasks derived from annotations of cluster bounding boxes, their center
coordinates, and outlier coordinates. OpenAI models and Gemini 2.5 Flash,
especially when prompted with examples, are viable options for counting
clusters and, in Flash's case, outliers (90%+ Accuracy). However, the results
for localization-related tasks are unsatisfactory: Precision and Recall are
near or below 50%, except for Flash in outlier identification (65.01%).
Furthermore, the impact of chart design on performance appears to be a
secondary factor, but it is advisable to avoid scatterplots with wide aspect
ratios (16:9 and 21:9) or those colored randomly. Supplementary materials are

Motivation: 混合线性动态系统（MoLDS）在建模具有多样化动态的时间序列数据时面临挑战，尤其是在复杂和噪声环境下。现有的张量方法和EM算法各有局限。

Method: 结合张量方法的全局可识别性保证和EM算法的灵活性，通过构造输入-输出数据的矩张量来恢复混合权重和系统参数的全局一致估计，再用Kalman EM算法进行优化。

Result: 在合成数据和真实神经数据上验证了方法的有效性，相比纯张量或随机初始化的EM方法，Tensor-EM表现出更高的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Conclusion: Tensor-EM方法为MoLDS学习提供了一种可靠途径，适用于复杂神经数据的建模和分析。

Abstract: Mixtures of linear dynamical systems (MoLDS) provide a path to model
time-series data that exhibit diverse temporal dynamics across trajectories.
However, its application remains challenging in complex and noisy settings,
limiting its effectiveness for neural data analysis. Tensor-based moment
methods can provide global identifiability guarantees for MoLDS, but their
performance degrades under noise and complexity. Commonly used
expectation-maximization (EM) methods offer flexibility in fitting latent
models but are highly sensitive to initialization and prone to poor local
minima. Here, we propose a tensor-based method that provides identifiability
guarantees for learning MoLDS, which is followed by EM updates to combine the
strengths of both approaches. The novelty in our approach lies in the
construction of moment tensors using the input-output data to recover globally
consistent estimates of mixture weights and system parameters. These estimates
can then be refined through a Kalman EM algorithm, with closed-form updates for
all LDS parameters. We validate our framework on synthetic benchmarks and
real-world datasets. On synthetic data, the proposed Tensor-EM method achieves
more reliable recovery and improved robustness compared to either pure tensor
or randomly initialized EM methods. We then analyze neural recordings from the
primate somatosensory cortex while a non-human primate performs reaches in
different directions. Our method successfully models and clusters different
conditions as separate subsystems, consistent with supervised single-LDS fits
for each condition. Finally, we apply this approach to another neural dataset
where monkeys perform a sequential reaching task. These results demonstrate
that MoLDS provides an effective framework for modeling complex neural data,
and that Tensor-EM is a reliable approach to MoLDS learning for these
applications.

Conclusion: 失败感知IRL是一种鲁棒且可扩展的方法，可用于审计模型对齐并减少IRL过程中的模糊性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) aligns Large Language
Models (LLMs) with human preferences, yet the underlying reward signals they
internalize remain hidden, posing a critical challenge for interpretability and
safety. Existing approaches attempt to extract these latent incentives using
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL), but treat all preference pairs equally,
often overlooking the most informative signals: those examples the extracted
reward model misclassifies or assigns nearly equal scores, which we term
\emph{failures}. We introduce a novel \emph{failure-aware} IRL algorithm that
focuses on misclassified or difficult examples to recover the latent rewards
defining model behaviors. By learning from these failures, our failure-aware
IRL extracts reward functions that better reflect the true objectives behind
RLHF. We demonstrate that failure-aware IRL outperforms existing IRL baselines
across multiple metrics when applied to LLM detoxification, without requiring
external classifiers or supervision. Crucially, failure-aware IRL yields
rewards that better capture the true incentives learned during RLHF, enabling
more effective re-RLHF training than standard IRL. This establishes
failure-aware IRL as a robust, scalable method for auditing model alignment and
reducing ambiguity in the IRL process.

Result: 框架成功审计了一个去毒化的LLM，生成了校准良好且可解释的目标，增强了对齐保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为审计LLM的真实目标提供了实用工具，推动AI更可信和可问责。

Abstract: The objectives that Large Language Models (LLMs) implicitly optimize remain
dangerously opaque, making trustworthy alignment and auditing a grand
challenge. While Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) can infer reward
functions from behaviour, existing approaches either produce a single,
overconfident reward estimate or fail to address the fundamental ambiguity of
the task (non-identifiability). This paper introduces a principled auditing
framework that re-frames reward inference from a simple estimation task to a
comprehensive process for verification. Our framework leverages Bayesian IRL to
not only recover a distribution over objectives but to enable three critical
audit capabilities: (i) Quantifying and systematically reducing
non-identifiability by demonstrating posterior contraction over sequential
rounds of evidence; (ii) Providing actionable, uncertainty-aware diagnostics
that expose spurious shortcuts and identify out-of-distribution prompts where
the inferred objective cannot be trusted; and (iii) Validating policy-level
utility by showing that the refined, low-uncertainty reward can be used
directly in RLHF to achieve training dynamics and toxicity reductions
comparable to the ground-truth alignment process. Empirically, our framework
successfully audits a detoxified LLM, yielding a well-calibrated and
interpretable objective that strengthens alignment guarantees. Overall, this
work provides a practical toolkit for auditors, safety teams, and regulators to
verify what LLMs are truly trying to achieve, moving us toward more trustworthy
and accountable AI.

Conclusion: 数据的局部性和组合性结构是神经网络高效学习和泛化的关键。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success, yet our understanding
of how they learn remains limited. These models can learn high-dimensional
tasks, which is generally statistically intractable due to the curse of
dimensionality. This apparent paradox suggests that learnable data must have an
underlying latent structure. What is the nature of this structure? How do
neural networks encode and exploit it, and how does it quantitatively impact
performance - for instance, how does generalization improve with the number of
training examples? This thesis addresses these questions by studying the roles
of locality and compositionality in data, tasks, and deep learning
representations.

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on chain-of-thought (CoT) data shows
that a small amount of high-quality data can outperform massive datasets. Yet,
what constitutes "quality" remains ill-defined. Existing reasoning methods rely
on indirect heuristics such as problem difficulty or trace length, while
instruction-tuning has explored a broader range of automated selection
strategies, but rarely in the context of reasoning. We propose to define
reasoning data quality using influence functions, which measure the causal
effect of individual CoT examples on downstream accuracy, and introduce
influence-based pruning, which consistently outperforms perplexity and
embedding-based baselines on math reasoning within a model family.

Conclusion: PGD框架为图生成模型的评估提供了更可靠和可比较的指标，已公开可用。

Abstract: Existing methods for evaluating graph generative models primarily rely on
Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics based on graph descriptors. While these
metrics can rank generative models, they do not provide an absolute measure of
performance. Their values are also highly sensitive to extrinsic parameters,
namely kernel and descriptor parametrization, making them incomparable across
different graph descriptors. We introduce PolyGraph Discrepancy (PGD), a new
evaluation framework that addresses these limitations. It approximates the
Jensen-Shannon distance of graph distributions by fitting binary classifiers to
distinguish between real and generated graphs, featurized by these descriptors.
The data log-likelihood of these classifiers approximates a variational lower
bound on the JS distance between the two distributions. Resulting metrics are
constrained to the unit interval [0,1] and are comparable across different
graph descriptors. We further derive a theoretically grounded summary metric
that combines these individual metrics to provide a maximally tight lower bound
on the distance for the given descriptors. Thorough experiments demonstrate
that PGD provides a more robust and insightful evaluation compared to MMD
metrics. The PolyGraph framework for benchmarking graph generative models is
made publicly available at https://github.com/BorgwardtLab/polygraph-benchmark.

Result: 实验表明，高准确率并不保证忠实性，新方法能发现传统指标（如准确率和公平性指标）忽略的细微变化。

Conclusion: 提出的指标为压缩模型的忠实性和公平性提供了更直接的评估方法，确保效率提升不损害可信AI的核心要求。

Abstract: In real-world applications, computational constraints often require
transforming large models into smaller, more efficient versions through model
compression. While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost
without sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused
on the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model
faithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like
healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain
faithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a
novel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond
standard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics
that capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions
include introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the
original and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared
tests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across
both the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts
that aggregate fairness metrics may obscure. We demonstrate our approaches by
applying quantization and pruning to artificial neural networks (ANNs) trained
on three diverse and socially meaningful datasets. Our findings show that high
accuracy does not guarantee faithfulness, and our statistical tests detect
subtle yet significant shifts that are missed by standard metrics, such as
Accuracy and Equalized Odds. The proposed metrics provide a practical and more
direct method for ensuring that efficiency gains through compression do not
compromise the fairness or faithfulness essential for trustworthy AI.

TL;DR: 论文提出了lm-Meter，一种轻量级在线延迟分析工具，用于本地LLM推理，解决了隐私和性能效率权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云部署LLM存在隐私和可持续性问题，本地部署LLM能提升隐私和可靠性，但面临内存和计算资源限制。

Method: 开发lm-Meter，实时捕获细粒度延迟，支持商业移动平台，并验证其高精度和低系统开销。

Result: lm-Meter在资源受限设备上表现出色，如预填充和解码阶段仅分别降低2.58%和0.99%的吞吐量。

Conclusion: lm-Meter为本地LLM推理提供了前所未有的运行时行为可见性，为优化和普及本地LLM系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into everyday
applications, but their prevalent cloud-based deployment raises growing
concerns around data privacy and long-term sustainability. Running LLMs locally
on mobile and edge devices (on-device LLMs) offers the promise of enhanced
privacy, reliability, and reduced communication costs. However, realizing this
vision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as
well as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on
resource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,
online latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures
fine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,
decode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We
implement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high
profiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput
reduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave
governor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies
revealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,
quantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic
optimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the
runtime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for
informed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM
systems. Code and tutorials are available at

Motivation: 利用自然语言描述作为任务元数据，指导多任务强化学习中的行为。

Method: 使用文本编码器和学习门控模块选择或混合子策略，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在MetaWorld基准测试中，LEXPOL在成功率和样本效率上匹配或超过基线方法。

Conclusion: 自然语言元数据能有效索引和重组策略中的可重用技能。

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning often relies on task metadata -- such as
brief natural-language descriptions -- to guide behavior across diverse
objectives. We present Lexical Policy Networks (LEXPOL), a language-conditioned
mixture-of-policies architecture for multi-task RL. LEXPOL encodes task
metadata with a text encoder and uses a learned gating module to select or
blend among multiple sub-policies, enabling end-to-end training across tasks.
On MetaWorld benchmarks, LEXPOL matches or exceeds strong multi-task baselines
in success rate and sample efficiency, without task-specific retraining. To
analyze the mechanism, we further study settings with fixed expert policies
obtained independently of the gate and show that the learned language gate
composes these experts to produce behaviors appropriate to novel task
descriptions and unseen task combinations. These results indicate that
natural-language metadata can effectively index and recombine reusable skills
within a single policy.

*Aleksandar Armacki,Ali H. Sayed*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了去中心化随机梯度下降（DSGD）在高概率（HP）收敛下的性能，消除了强假设，展示了与均方误差（MSE）收敛相同的条件，并实现了线性加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在去中心化设置中对HP收敛的假设过于严格，与集中式设置中的SGD形成对比，后者在相同条件下即可实现HP和MSE收敛。

Method: 通过分析梯度或最优性间隙的矩生成函数（MGF）以及用户模型间的一致性间隙，改进了DSGD的HP收敛分析。

Result: DSGD在HP收敛下与MSE收敛条件相同，无需强假设，且在非凸和强凸成本下均达到最优速率，并实现用户数量的线性加速。

Conclusion: 研究填补了去中心化设置中HP与MSE收敛条件的差距，展示了DSGD在HP下的强大性能，并提供了独立感兴趣的方差减少效应和MGF精细边界。

Abstract: Convergence in high-probability (HP) has been receiving increasing interest,
due to its attractive properties, such as exponentially decaying tail bounds
and strong guarantees for each individual run of an algorithm. While HP
guarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is
understood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in
decentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded
gradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap
between assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the
mean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic
Gradient Descent ($\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized
settings, where it is known that $\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same
conditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.
Motivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\mathtt{DSGD}$ in
the presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in
HP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing
uniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while
simultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly
convex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the
number of users, demonstrating that $\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong
performance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved
results stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest
(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap
between users' models. To achieve linear speed-up, we provide a novel result on
the variance-reduction effect of decentralized methods in the HP sense and more
fine-grained bounds on the MGF for strongly convex costs, which are both of
independent interest.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）作为人类代理生成合成数据，以模拟人类决策行为，解决异构团队协作中的非静态策略问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖昂贵的人类参与数据，限制了可扩展性。LLM可以作为策略无关的人类代理，提供可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 通过三个实验评估LLM在网格世界捕获游戏中的表现，比较LLM与人类参与者和专家的决策一致性。

Result: LLM在决策一致性和风险敏感性方面与人类行为相似，能够生成类似人类的轨迹。

Conclusion: LLM虽不能完全复制人类适应性，但其提示引导的多样性为模拟策略无关队友提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: A critical challenge in modelling Heterogeneous-Agent Teams is training
agents to collaborate with teammates whose policies are inaccessible or
non-stationary, such as humans. Traditional approaches rely on expensive
human-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large
Language Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic
data that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three
experiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory
paradigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions
from 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and
Mixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward
structures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating
consistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies
prompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. "be risk averse"). LLM
outputs mirror human participants' variability, shifting between risk-averse
and risk-seeking behaviours. Finally, Experiment 3 tests LLMs in a dynamic
grid-world where the LLM agents generate movement actions. LLMs produce
trajectories resembling human participants' paths. While LLMs cannot yet fully
replicate human adaptability, their prompt-guided diversity offers a scalable
foundation for simulating policy-agnostic teammates.

Conclusion: 先验信息适应的策略能有效增强基础模型对高维数据的处理能力，为生物医学研究提供新见解。

Abstract: Revealing novel insights from the relationship between molecular measurements
and pathology remains a very impactful application of machine learning in
biomedicine. Data in this domain typically contain only a few observations but
thousands of potentially noisy features, posing challenges for conventional
machine learning approaches. While prior-data fitted networks emerge as
foundation models for tabular data, they are currently not suited to handle
large feature counts (>500). Although feature reduction enables their
application, it hinders feature importance analysis. We propose a strategy that
extends existing models through continued pre-training on synthetic data
sampled from a customized prior. The resulting model, TabPFN-Wide, matches or
exceeds its base model's performance while exhibiting improved robustness to
noise. It seamlessly scales beyond 50,000 features, regardless of noise levels,
while maintaining inherent interpretability, which is critical for biomedical
applications. Our results show that prior-informed adaptation is suitable to
enhance the capability of foundation models for high-dimensional data. On
real-world biomedical datasets many of the most relevant features identified by
the model overlap with previous biological findings, while others propose
potential starting points for future studies.

Conclusion: 该理论为复杂模型的特征归因提供了更全面的解释框架。

Abstract: Feature attributions are post-training analysis methods that assess how
various input features of a machine learning model contribute to an output
prediction. Their interpretation is straightforward when features act
independently, but becomes less direct when the predictive model involves
interactions such as multiplicative relationships or joint feature
contributions. In this work, we propose a general theory of higher-order
feature attribution, which we develop on the foundation of Integrated Gradients
(IG). This work extends existing frameworks in the literature on explainable
AI. When using IG as the method of feature attribution, we discover natural
connections to statistics and topological signal processing. We provide several
theoretical results that establish the theory, and we validate our theory on a
few examples.

Abstract: We establish a fundamental connection between score-based diffusion models
and non-equilibrium thermodynamics by deriving performance limits based on
entropy rates. Our main theoretical contribution is a lower bound on the
negative log-likelihood of the data that relates model performance to entropy
rates of diffusion processes. We numerically validate this bound on a synthetic
dataset and investigate its tightness. By building a bridge to entropy rates -
system, intrinsic, and exchange entropy - we provide new insights into the
thermodynamic operation of these models, drawing parallels to Maxwell's demon
and implications for thermodynamic computing hardware. Our framework connects
generative modeling performance to fundamental physical principles through
stochastic thermodynamics.

Conclusion: 通过自适应集成和在线共形预测，有效提升了图结构数据的不确定性量化性能。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) over graphs arises in a number of
safety-critical applications in network science. The Gaussian process (GP), as
a classical Bayesian framework for UQ, has been developed to handle
graph-structured data by devising topology-aware kernel functions. However,
such GP-based approaches are limited not only by the prohibitive computational
complexity, but also the strict modeling assumptions that might yield poor
coverage, especially with labels arriving on the fly. To effect scalability, we
devise a novel graph-aware parametric GP model by leveraging the random feature
(RF)-based kernel approximation, which is amenable to efficient recursive
Bayesian model updates. To further allow for adaptivity, an ensemble of
graph-aware RF-based scalable GPs have been leveraged, with per-GP weight
adapted to data arriving incrementally. To ensure valid coverage with
robustness to model mis-specification, we wed the GP-based set predictors with
the online conformal prediction framework, which post-processes the prediction
sets using adaptive thresholds. Experimental results the proposed method yields
improved coverage and efficient prediction sets over existing baselines by
adaptively ensembling the GP models and setting the key threshold parameters in
CP.

empirical advantages, with important implications for frontier LLMs that aspire
to tackle increasingly hard problems and work universally across domains beyond

Abstract: Scaling unsupervised skill discovery algorithms to high-DoF agents remains
challenging. As dimensionality increases, the exploration space grows
exponentially, while the manifold of meaningful skills remains limited.
Therefore, semantic meaningfulness becomes essential to effectively guide
exploration in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we present
Reference-Grounded Skill Discovery (RGSD), a novel algorithm that grounds skill
discovery in a semantically meaningful latent space using reference data. RGSD
first performs contrastive pretraining to embed motions on a unit hypersphere,
clustering each reference trajectory into a distinct direction. This grounding
enables skill discovery to simultaneously involve both imitation of reference
behaviors and the discovery of semantically related diverse behaviors. On a
simulated SMPL humanoid with 359-D observations and 69-D actions, RGSD learns
structured skills including walking, running, punching, and side stepping, and
also discovers related novel behaviors. In downstream control tasks, RGSD
outperforms imitation-based skill acquisition baselines. Our results suggest
that lightweight reference-guided grounding offers a practical path to
discovering semantically rich and structured skills in high-DoF systems.

Conclusion: 量化误差受训练动态影响，战略干预超参数可改善大规模量化效果。

Abstract: While post-training quantization is widely adopted for efficient deployment
of large language models, the mechanisms underlying quantization robustness
remain unclear. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of quantization degradation
across open-source language model training trajectories up to 32B parameters
and 15T training tokens to accurately assess the relationship between training
dynamics and quantization performance. Our key finding is that quantization
errors in large-scale training runs are driven by a complex interplay between
learning rate and other training hyperparameters. Specifically, once learning
rates decay, validation loss and quantization error diverge, largely
independent of training data scale. To investigate interventions on the
training dynamics and identify specific configurations that can modulate
quantization robustness favorably, we train our own models in controlled
experiments up to 100B tokens. Our results challenge the assumption that
increasing dataset scale inherently compromises quantization effectiveness,
demonstrating instead that strategic training hyperparameter interventions can
improve quantization quality at scale.

Conclusion: 分层是解决LLM搜索代理中结构异质性的有效方法，显著提升RL性能。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents increasingly rely on external tools such as
search engines to solve complex, multi-step problems, and reinforcement
learning (RL) has become a key paradigm for training them. However, the
trajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations
in the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally
different answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient
methods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and
formalize as cross-stratum bias-an "apples-to-oranges" comparison of
heterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment
and hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address
this, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage
Normalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on
their structural properties and computes advantages locally within each
stratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true
peers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields
conditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains
the global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard
normalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To
improve practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly
blend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse
single-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that
Stratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3
points, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more
effective search policies. These results establish stratification as a
principled remedy for structural heterogeneity in RL for LLM search agents.

TL;DR: VER（Vision Expert transformer for Robot learning）通过蒸馏多个视觉基础模型（VFMs）到一个统一的视觉专家库，并仅微调轻量级路由网络，实现了跨任务的高性能机器人学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型（VFMs）通常在特定领域表现优异，但跨任务泛化能力有限。VER旨在通过动态选择和整合多个VFMs的专家知识，提升机器人学习的灵活性和性能。

Method: VER在预训练阶段将多个VFMs蒸馏到视觉专家库中，随后仅微调一个轻量级路由网络（参数少于0.4%）来动态选择任务相关专家。此外，引入了Patchwise Expert Routing和Curriculum Top-K Annealing技术以提升动态选择的灵活性和精度。

Result: 在17个多样化的机器人任务中，VER实现了最先进的性能，能够减少任务无关区域的干扰并专注于关键区域。

Conclusion: VER通过动态专家选择和参数高效微调，显著提升了机器人学习的跨任务性能和适应性。

Abstract: Pretrained vision foundation models (VFMs) advance robotic learning via rich
visual representations, yet individual VFMs typically excel only in specific
domains, limiting generality across tasks. Distilling multiple VFMs into a
unified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields
inflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training
to incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert
transformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs
into a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing
network (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant
experts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further
introduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve
both flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER
supports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and
adaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks
and multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance. We find
that VER reduces large-norm outliers in task-irrelevant regions (e.g.,
background) and concentrates on task-critical regions. Visualizations and codes
can be found in https://yixiaowang7.github.io/ver_page/.

Result: 实验表明，ADP在仿真和实际测试中均显著提高了导航的成功率、安全性和效率。

Conclusion: ADP通过动态调整动态属性，有效解决了传统方法的局限性，适用于多样化环境。

Abstract: Autonomous robot navigation systems often rely on hierarchical planning,
where global planners compute collision-free paths without considering
dynamics, and local planners enforce dynamics constraints to produce executable
commands. This discontinuity in dynamics often leads to trajectory tracking
failure in highly constrained environments. Recent approaches integrate
dynamics within the entire planning process by gradually decreasing its
fidelity, e.g., increasing integration steps and reducing collision checking
resolution, for real-time planning efficiency. However, they assume that the
fidelity of the dynamics should decrease according to a manually designed
scheme. Such static settings fail to adapt to environmental complexity
variations, resulting in computational overhead in simple environments or
insufficient dynamics consideration in obstacle-rich scenarios. To overcome
this limitation, we propose Adaptive Dynamics Planning (ADP), a
learning-augmented paradigm that uses reinforcement learning to dynamically
adjust robot dynamics properties, enabling planners to adapt across diverse
environments. We integrate ADP into three different planners and further design
a standalone ADP-based navigation system, benchmarking them against other
baselines. Experiments in both simulation and real-world tests show that ADP
consistently improves navigation success, safety, and efficiency.

Abstract: Tactile sensing holds great promise for enhancing manipulation precision and

present a low-cost, easy-to-make, adaptable, and compact fingertip design for

sensors to capture static forces and a contact microphone sensor to measure
high-frequency vibrations during contact. These tactile sensors are integrated
into a compact design with a minimal sensor footprint, and all sensors are
internal to the fingertip and therefore not susceptible to direct wear and tear
from interactions. From sensor characterization, we show that strain gauge
sensors provide repeatable 2D planar force measurements in the 0-5 N range and
the contact microphone sensor has the capability to distinguish contact
material properties. We apply our design to three dexterous manipulation tasks
that range from zero to full visual occlusion. Given the expressiveness and
reliability of tactile sensor readings, we show that different tactile sensing
modalities can be used flexibly in different stages of manipulation, solely or
together with visual observations to achieve improved task performance. For
instance, we can precisely count and unstack a desired number of paper cups
from a stack with 100\% success rate which is hard to achieve with vision only.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型在线自适应人机交互框架，针对上肢残疾用户，通过集成关节限制模型和分层最优控制器，实现个性化的机器人反应行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人机协作方法假设用户身体健全，忽略了上肢残疾用户的需求，导致工作环境缺乏包容性。

Method: 将关节限制模型集成到分层最优控制器中，使机器人能够在线生成反应行为，并引导用户利用残余功能。

Result: 在模拟不同上肢残疾的手递任务中，框架能够根据用户的功能限制个性化交互，并鼓励关节使用。

Conclusion: 该框架为上肢残疾用户提供了更具包容性的工作环境，并展示了在个性化人机交互中的潜力。

Abstract: Work environments are often inadequate and lack inclusivity for individuals
with upper-body disabilities. This paper presents a novel online framework for
adaptive human-robot interaction (HRI) that accommodates users' arm mobility
impairments, ultimately aiming to promote active work participation. Unlike
traditional human-robot collaboration approaches that assume able-bodied users,
our method integrates a mobility model for specific joint limitations into a
hierarchical optimal controller. This allows the robot to generate reactive,
mobility-aware behaviour online and guides the user's impaired limb to exploit
residual functional mobility. The framework was tested in handover tasks
involving different upper-limb mobility impairments (i.e., emulated elbow and
shoulder arthritis, and wrist blockage), under both standing and seated
configurations with task constraints using a mobile manipulator, and
complemented by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art
ergonomic HRI approaches. Preliminary results indicated that the framework can
personalise the interaction to fit within the user's impaired range of motion
and encourage joint usage based on the severity of their functional
limitations.

Conclusion: 该方法通过语义推理和场景图生成显著提升了探索任务的效率和准确性。

Abstract: We develop an approach for active semantic perception which refers to using
the semantics of the scene for tasks such as exploration. We build a compact,
hierarchical multi-layer scene graph that can represent large, complex indoor
environments at various levels of abstraction, e.g., nodes corresponding to
rooms, objects, walls, windows etc. as well as fine-grained details of their
geometry. We develop a procedure based on large language models (LLMs) to
sample plausible scene graphs of unobserved regions that are consistent with
partial observations of the scene. These samples are used to compute an
information gain of a potential waypoint for sophisticated spatial reasoning,
e.g., the two doors in the living room can lead to either a kitchen or a
bedroom. We evaluate this approach in complex, realistic 3D indoor environments
in simulation. We show using qualitative and quantitative experiments that our
approach can pin down the semantics of the environment quicker and more
accurately than baseline approaches.

Result: 在三种机器人平台上验证了模型的有效性，能够处理时空变化的环境条件。

Conclusion: 该方法在仿真和实际系统中均能有效应对环境变化，提升了移动机器人的适应能力。

Abstract: Mobile robots, such as ground vehicles and quadrotors, are becoming
increasingly important in various fields, from logistics to agriculture, where
they automate processes in environments that are difficult to access for
humans. However, to perform effectively in uncertain environments using
model-based controllers, these systems require dynamics models capable of
responding to environmental variations, especially when direct access to
environmental information is limited. To enable such adaptivity and facilitate
integration with model predictive control, we propose an adaptive dynamics
model which bypasses the need for direct environmental knowledge by inferring
operational environments from state-action history. The dynamics model is based
on neural ordinary equations, and a two-phase training procedure is used to
learn latent environment representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach through goal-reaching and path-tracking tasks on three robotic
platforms of increasing complexity: a 2D differential wheeled robot with
changing wheel contact conditions, a 3D quadrotor in variational wind fields,
and the Sphero BOLT robot under two contact conditions for real-world
deployment. Empirical results corroborate that our method can handle temporally
and spatially varying environmental changes in both simulation and real-world
systems.

Conclusion: 去中心化双视角估计框架在机器人操作任务中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accurate pose and velocity estimation is essential for effective spatial task
planning in robotic manipulators. While centralized sensor fusion has
traditionally been used to improve pose estimation accuracy, this paper
presents a novel decentralized fusion approach to estimate both pose and
velocity. We use dual-view measurements from an eye-in-hand and an eye-to-hand
vision sensor configuration mounted on a manipulator to track a target object
whose motion is modeled as random walk (stochastic acceleration model). The
robot runs two independent adaptive extended Kalman filters formulated on a
matrix Lie group, developed as part of this work. These filters predict poses
and velocities on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3) \times \mathbb{R}^3 \times
\mathbb{R}^3$ and update the state on the manifold $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. The final
fused state comprising the fused pose and velocities of the target is obtained
using a correlation-aware fusion rule on Lie groups. The proposed method is
evaluated on a UFactory xArm 850 equipped with Intel RealSense cameras,
tracking a moving target. Experimental results validate the effectiveness and
robustness of the proposed decentralized dual-view estimation framework,
showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We present ARRC (Advanced Reasoning Robot Control), a practical system that
connects natural-language instructions to safe local robotic control by
combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with RGB-D perception and
guarded execution on an affordable robot arm. The system indexes curated robot
knowledge (movement patterns, task templates, and safety heuristics) in a
vector database, retrieves task-relevant context for each instruction, and
conditions a large language model (LLM) to produce JSON-structured action
plans. Plans are executed on a UFactory xArm 850 fitted with a Dynamixel-driven
parallel gripper and an Intel RealSense D435 camera. Perception uses AprilTag
detections fused with depth to produce object-centric metric poses. Execution
is enforced via software safety gates: workspace bounds, speed and force caps,
timeouts, and bounded retries. We describe the architecture, knowledge design,
integration choices, and a reproducible evaluation protocol for tabletop scan,
approach, and pick-place tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy
of the proposed approach. Our design shows that RAG-based planning can
substantially improve plan validity and adaptability while keeping perception
and low-level control local to the robot.

Motivation: 传统APF方法在障碍环境中存在死锁和局部极小问题，且现有解决方案被动低效。

Method: GO-Flock包含上游感知模块（处理深度图生成路径点）和下游群体导航模块（采用新型APF策略）。

Result: 在障碍环境中验证了GO-Flock优于被动APF方法，并在硬件实验中成功控制九架无人机。

Conclusion: GO-Flock通过规划与反应式控制结合，有效提升了群体导航在复杂环境中的性能。

Abstract: Artificial Potential Field (APF) methods are widely used for reactive
flocking control, but they often suffer from challenges such as deadlocks and
local minima, especially in the presence of obstacles. Existing solutions to
address these issues are typically passive, leading to slow and inefficient
collective navigation. As a result, many APF approaches have only been
validated in obstacle-free environments or simplified, pseudo 3D simulations.
This paper presents GO-Flock, a hybrid flocking framework that integrates
planning with reactive APF-based control. GO-Flock consists of an upstream
Perception Module, which processes depth maps to extract waypoints and virtual
agents for obstacle avoidance, and a downstream Collective Navigation Module,
which applies a novel APF strategy to achieve effective flocking behavior in
cluttered environments. We evaluate GO-Flock against passive APF-based
approaches to demonstrate their respective merits, such as their flocking
behavior and the ability to overcome local minima. Finally, we validate
GO-Flock through obstacle-filled environment and also hardware-in-the-loop
experiments where we successfully flocked a team of nine drones, six physical
and three virtual, in a forest environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 透明物体操作研究目前局限于短时程任务和基础抓取能力，缺乏对新物体的泛化能力和精确长时程操作的支持。

Method: DeLTa整合了深度估计、6D姿态估计和视觉语言规划，并采用单次演示方法泛化6D轨迹，无需类别先验或额外训练。

Result: DeLTa在长时程透明物体操作任务中显著优于现有方法，尤其在需要精确操作的场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: DeLTa为透明物体的长时程精确操作提供了高效且泛化能力强的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the prevalence of transparent object interactions in human everyday
life, transparent robotic manipulation research remains limited to
short-horizon tasks and basic grasping capabilities.Although some methods have
partially addressed these issues, most of them have limitations in
generalizability to novel objects and are insufficient for precise long-horizon
robot manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose DeLTa (Demonstration
and Language-Guided Novel Transparent Object Manipulation), a novel framework
that integrates depth estimation, 6D pose estimation, and vision-language
planning for precise long-horizon manipulation of transparent objects guided by
natural task instructions. A key advantage of our method is its
single-demonstration approach, which generalizes 6D trajectories to novel
transparent objects without requiring category-level priors or additional
training. Additionally, we present a task planner that refines the
VLM-generated plan to account for the constraints of a single-arm, eye-in-hand
robot for long-horizon object manipulation tasks. Through comprehensive
evaluation, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
transparent object manipulation approaches, particularly in long-horizon
scenarios requiring precise manipulation capabilities. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在需要高精度的任务中表现有限，且测试时扩展方法需要额外训练且泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出MG-Select框架，利用KL散度作为置信度指标，通过随机掩码生成参考分布，并结合联合训练策略优化参考分布质量。

Result: 实验显示MG-Select在真实世界任务中性能显著提升，包括分布内/外任务和RoboCasa任务。

Conclusion: MG-Select通过内部属性利用和联合训练策略，显著提升了VLA模型在高精度任务中的表现。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
in robot control. However, they remain fundamentally limited in tasks that
require high precision due to their single-inference paradigm. While test-time
scaling approaches using external verifiers have shown promise, they require
additional training and fail to generalize to unseen conditions. We propose
Masking Distribution Guided Selection (MG-Select), a novel test-time scaling
framework for VLAs that leverages the model's internal properties without
requiring additional training or external modules. Our approach utilizes KL
divergence from a reference action token distribution as a confidence metric
for selecting the optimal action from multiple candidates. We introduce a
reference distribution generated by the same VLA but with randomly masked
states and language conditions as inputs, ensuring maximum uncertainty while
remaining aligned with the target task distribution. Additionally, we propose a
joint training strategy that enables the model to learn both conditional and
unconditional distributions by applying dropout to state and language
conditions, thereby further improving the quality of the reference
distribution. Our experiments demonstrate that MG-Select achieves significant
performance improvements, including a 28%/35% improvement in real-world
in-distribution/out-of-distribution tasks, along with a 168% relative gain on
RoboCasa pick-and-place tasks trained with 30 demonstrations.

TL;DR: OMC-RL框架通过两阶段学习（上游表征学习和下游策略学习）提升视觉运动策略的样本效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维视觉输入与敏捷动作输出结合导致的样本效率低和仿真到现实的差距问题。

Method: 上游阶段使用掩码Transformer和对比学习提取时序感知表征；下游阶段通过特权教师策略提供早期指导。

Result: 实验显示OMC-RL在样本效率和策略性能上表现优越，且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: OMC-RL有效解决了视觉运动策略学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: A prevailing approach for learning visuomotor policies is to employ
reinforcement learning to map high-dimensional visual observations directly to
action commands. However, the combination of high-dimensional visual inputs and
agile maneuver outputs leads to long-standing challenges, including low sample
efficiency and significant sim-to-real gaps. To address these issues, we
propose Oracle-Guided Masked Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (OMC-RL), a
novel framework designed to improve the sample efficiency and asymptotic
performance of visuomotor policy learning. OMC-RL explicitly decouples the
learning process into two stages: an upstream representation learning stage and
a downstream policy learning stage. In the upstream stage, a masked Transformer
module is trained with temporal modeling and contrastive learning to extract
temporally-aware and task-relevant representations from sequential visual
inputs. After training, the learned encoder is frozen and used to extract
visual representations from consecutive frames, while the Transformer module is
discarded. In the downstream stage, an oracle teacher policy with privileged
access to global state information supervises the agent during early training
to provide informative guidance and accelerate early policy learning. This
guidance is gradually reduced to allow independent exploration as training
progresses. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments
demonstrate that OMC-RL achieves superior sample efficiency and asymptotic
policy performance, while also improving generalization across diverse and
perceptually complex scenarios.

Conclusion: 框架能够准确表示复杂轨迹并保证稳定性，适用于机器人运动规划和控制。

Abstract: Learning stable dynamical systems from data is crucial for safe and reliable
robot motion planning and control. However, extending stability guarantees to
trajectories defined on Riemannian manifolds poses significant challenges due
to the manifold's geometric constraints. To address this, we propose a general
framework for learning stable dynamical systems on Riemannian manifolds using
neural ordinary differential equations. Our method guarantees stability by
projecting the neural vector field evolving on the manifold so that it strictly
satisfies the Lyapunov stability criterion, ensuring stability at every system
state. By leveraging a flexible neural parameterisation for both the base
vector field and the Lyapunov function, our framework can accurately represent
complex trajectories while respecting manifold constraints by evolving
solutions directly on the manifold. We provide an efficient training strategy
for applying our framework and demonstrate its utility by solving Riemannian
LASA datasets on the unit quaternion (S^3) and symmetric positive-definite
matrix manifolds, as well as robotic motions evolving on \mathbb{R}^3 \times
S^3. We demonstrate the performance, scalability, and practical applicability
of our approach through extensive simulations and by learning robot motions in
a real-world experiment.

Abstract: This research introduces two efficient methods to estimate the collision risk
of planned trajectories in autonomous driving under uncertain driving
conditions. Deterministic collision checks of planned trajectories are often
inaccurate or overly conservative, as noisy perception, localization errors,
and uncertain predictions of other traffic participants introduce significant
uncertainty into the planning process. This paper presents two semi-analytic
methods to compute the collision probability of planned trajectories with
arbitrary convex obstacles. The first approach evaluates the probability of
spatial overlap between an autonomous vehicle and surrounding obstacles, while
the second estimates the collision probability based on stochastic boundary
crossings. Both formulations incorporate full state uncertainties, including
position, orientation, and velocity, and achieve high accuracy at computational
costs suitable for real-time planning. Simulation studies verify that the
proposed methods closely match Monte Carlo results while providing significant
runtime advantages, enabling their use in risk-aware trajectory planning. The
collision estimation methods are available as open-source software:

Abstract: Wearable robots offer a promising solution for quantitatively monitoring gait
and providing systematic, adaptive assistance to promote patient independence
and improve gait. However, due to significant interpersonal and intrapersonal
variability in walking patterns, it is important to design robot controllers
that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each individual. This paper
investigates the potential of human-in-the-loop optimisation (HILO) to deliver
personalised assistance in gait training. The Covariance Matrix Adaptation
Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) was employed to continuously optimise an
assist-as-needed controller of a lower-limb exoskeleton. Six healthy
individuals participated over a two-day experiment. Our results suggest that
while the CMA-ES appears to converge to a unique set of stiffnesses for each
individual, no measurable impact on the subjects' performance was observed
during the validation trials. These findings highlight the impact of
human-robot co-adaptation and human behaviour variability, whose effect may be
greater than potential benefits of personalising rule-based assistive
controllers. Our work contributes to understanding the limitations of current
personalisation approaches in exoskeleton-assisted gait rehabilitation and
identifies key challenges for effective implementation of human-in-the-loop
optimisation in this domain.

Abstract: Robotic grasping is one of the most fundamental tasks in robotic
manipulation, and grasp detection/generation has long been the subject of
extensive research. Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a
promising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities. However,
most existing approaches either lack sufficient reasoning and generalization
capabilities or depend on complex modular pipelines. Moreover, current grasp
foundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting
in inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain
strong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we
propose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates
visual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp
generation. VCoT-Grasp adopts a multi-turn processing paradigm that dynamically
focuses on visual inputs while providing interpretable reasoning traces. For
training, we refine and introduce a large-scale dataset, VCoT-GraspSet,
comprising 167K synthetic images with over 1.36M grasps, as well as 400+
real-world images with more than 1.2K grasps, annotated with intermediate
bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on both VCoT-GraspSet and real robot
demonstrate that our method significantly improves grasp success rates and
generalizes effectively to unseen objects, backgrounds, and distractors. More

Motivation: 现有协同设计框架通常仅优化最大高度或最小能耗，忽略了二者的权衡，且常忽略变速箱参数优化和使用简化的执行器质量模型，导致设计难以实际复现。

Method: 引入了一种三阶段协同设计优化框架，结合了真实的执行器质量模型，并在统一框架内优化机械设计（包括变速箱）和控制参数。

Result: 实验评估显示，与基线设计相比，机械能耗降低了50%，同时实现了0.8米的跳跃高度。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了手动设计迭代，并生成了可直接制造的参数化CAD模型。

Abstract: A monoped's jump height and energy consumption depend on both, its mechanical
design and control strategy. Existing co-design frameworks typically optimize
for either maximum height or minimum energy, neglecting their trade-off. They
also often omit gearbox parameter optimization and use oversimplified actuator
mass models, producing designs difficult to replicate in practice. In this
work, we introduce a novel three-stage co-design optimization framework that
jointly maximizes jump height while minimizing mechanical energy consumption of
a monoped. The proposed method explicitly incorporates realistic actuator mass
models and optimizes mechanical design (including gearbox) and control
parameters within a unified framework. The resulting design outputs are then
used to automatically generate a parameterized CAD model suitable for direct
fabrication, significantly reducing manual design iterations. Our experimental
evaluations demonstrate a 50 percent reduction in mechanical energy consumption
compared to the baseline design, while achieving a jump height of 0.8m. Video

Result: 在仿真中，该方法成功发现了有效的运动策略，并实现了短时运动预测。

Conclusion: 潜在动力学MB-RL框架为软体机器人自适应运动提供了新思路。

Abstract: Soft robotic crawlers are mobile robots that utilize soft body deformability
and compliance to achieve locomotion through surface contact. Designing control
strategies for such systems is challenging due to model inaccuracies, sensor
noise, and the need to discover locomotor gaits. In this work, we present a
model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) framework in which latent dynamics
inferred from onboard sensors serve as a predictive model that guides an
actor-critic algorithm to optimize locomotor policies. We evaluate the
framework on a minimal crawler model in simulation using inertial measurement
units and time-of-flight sensors as observations. The learned latent dynamics
enable short-horizon motion prediction while the actor-critic discovers
effective locomotor policies. This approach highlights the potential of
latent-dynamics MB-RL for enabling embodied soft robotic adaptive locomotion
based solely on noisy sensor feedback.

Abstract: Planetary exploration missions require robust locomotion systems capable of
operating in extreme environments over extended periods. This paper presents
the DISTANT (Distant Transmission and Steering Systems) design, a novel
approach for relocating rover traction and steering actuators from
wheel-mounted positions to a thermally protected warm box within the rover
body. The design addresses critical challenges in long-distance traversal
missions by protecting sensitive components from thermal cycling, dust
contamination, and mechanical wear. A double wishbone suspension configuration
with cardan joints and capstan drive steering has been selected as the optimal
architecture following comprehensive trade-off analysis. The system enables
independent wheel traction, steering control, and suspension management whilst
maintaining all motorisation within the protected environment. The design meets
a 50 km traverse requirement without performance degradation, with integrated
dust protection mechanisms and thermal management solutions. Testing and
validation activities are planned for Q1 2026 following breadboard
manufacturing at 1:3 scale.

### [212] [Coordinate-Consistent Localization via Continuous-Time Calibration and Fusion of UWB and SLAM Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05992)
*Tien-Dat Nguyen,Thien-Minh Nguyen,Vinh-Hao Nguyen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种两阶段方法，通过校准和融合UWB与SLAM数据，实现跨会话的坐标一致性和高精度定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SLAM坐标原点每次运行重置的问题，以及UWB定位需要精确锚点坐标分配的问题。

Method: 第一阶段通过连续时间批量优化恢复锚点的3D位置；第二阶段通过滑动窗口优化融合UWB和SLAM数据。

Result: 在NTU VIRAL数据集上的实验表明，单次运行数据校准即可实现后续运行的高精度定位。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了跨会话定位的一致性问题，并开源代码以促进社区发展。

Abstract: Onboard simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) methods are commonly
used to provide accurate localization information for autonomous robots.
However, the coordinate origin of SLAM estimate often resets for each run. On
the other hand, UWB-based localization with fixed anchors can ensure a
consistent coordinate reference across sessions; however, it requires an
accurate assignment of the anchor nodes' coordinates. To this end, we propose a
two-stage approach that calibrates and fuses UWB data and SLAM data to achieve
coordinate-wise consistent and accurate localization in the same environment.
In the first stage, we solve a continuous-time batch optimization problem by
using the range and odometry data from one full run, incorporating height
priors and anchor-to-anchor distance factors to recover the anchors' 3D
positions. For the subsequent runs in the second stage, a sliding-window
optimization scheme fuses the UWB and SLAM data, which facilitates accurate
localization in the same coordinate system. Experiments are carried out on the
NTU VIRAL dataset with six scenarios of UAV flight, and we show that
calibration using data in one run is sufficient to enable accurate localization
in the remaining runs. We release our source code to benefit the community at
https://github.com/ntdathp/slam-uwb-calibration.

### [213] [Cross-Embodiment Dexterous Hand Articulation Generation via Morphology-Aware Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06068)
*Heng Zhang,Kevin Yuchen Ma,Mike Zheng Shou,Weisi Lin,Yan Wu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于eigengrasp的端到端框架，用于跨形态的灵巧抓取生成，通过低维空间预测关节动作，实现了高成功率和快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多指灵巧抓取的高维动作和优化成本问题，现有方法泛化能力有限。

Method: 从手部形态描述中提取形态嵌入和eigengrasp集，结合物体点云和手腕姿态，预测低维空间的动作系数，并通过KAL损失监督学习。

Result: 在仿真中达到91.9%的平均抓取成功率，推理时间小于0.4秒；通过少量样本适应新手部，仿真和真实世界分别达到85.6%和87%的成功率。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在跨形态灵巧抓取中表现出色，具有高泛化能力和实用性。

Abstract: Dexterous grasping with multi-fingered hands remains challenging due to
high-dimensional articulations and the cost of optimization-based pipelines.
Existing end-to-end methods require training on large-scale datasets for
specific hands, limiting their ability to generalize across different
embodiments. We propose an eigengrasp-based, end-to-end framework for
cross-embodiment grasp generation. From a hand's morphology description, we
derive a morphology embedding and an eigengrasp set. Conditioned on these,
together with the object point cloud and wrist pose, an amplitude predictor
regresses articulation coefficients in a low-dimensional space, which are
decoded into full joint articulations. Articulation learning is supervised with
a Kinematic-Aware Articulation Loss (KAL) that emphasizes fingertip-relevant
motions and injects morphology-specific structure. In simulation on unseen
objects across three dexterous hands, our model attains a 91.9% average grasp
success rate with less than 0.4 seconds inference per grasp. With few-shot
adaptation to an unseen hand, it achieves 85.6% success on unseen objects in
simulation, and real-world experiments on this few-shot generalized hand
achieve an 87% success rate. The code and additional materials will be made
available upon publication on our project website

Abstract: This project proposes a bioinspired multi-robot system using Distributed
Optimization for efficient exploration and mapping of unknown environments.
Each robot explores its environment and creates a map, which is afterwards put
together to form a global 2D map of the environment. Inspired by wall-following
behaviors, each robot autonomously explores its neighborhood based on a tactile
sensor, similar to the antenna of a cockroach, mounted on the surface of the
robot. Instead of avoiding obstacles, robots log collision points when they
touch obstacles. This decentralized control strategy ensures effective task
allocation and efficient exploration of unknown terrains, with applications in
search and rescue, industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. The
approach was validated through experiments using e-puck robots in a simulated
1.5 x 1.5 m environment with three obstacles. The results demonstrated the
system's effectiveness in achieving high coverage, minimizing collisions, and
constructing accurate 2D maps.

Conclusion: 胶带操作是实现机器人伤口护理自动化的重要一步。

Abstract: Chronic wounds, such as diabetic, pressure, and venous ulcers, affect over
6.5 million patients in the United States alone and generate an annual cost
exceeding \$25 billion. Despite this burden, chronic wound care remains a
routine yet manual process performed exclusively by trained clinicians due to
its critical safety demands. We envision a future in which robotics and
automation support wound care to lower costs and enhance patient outcomes. This
paper introduces an autonomous framework for one of the most fundamental yet
challenging subtasks in wound redressing: adhesive tape manipulation.
Specifically, we address two critical capabilities: tape initial detachment
(TID) and secure tape placement. To handle the complex adhesive dynamics of
detachment, we propose a force-feedback imitation learning approach trained
from human teleoperation demonstrations. For tape placement, we develop a
numerical trajectory optimization method based to ensure smooth adhesion and
wrinkle-free application across diverse anatomical surfaces. We validate these
methods through extensive experiments, demonstrating reliable performance in
both quantitative evaluations and integrated wound redressing pipelines. Our
results establish tape manipulation as an essential step toward practical
robotic wound care automation.

Conclusion: 该系统首次结合视觉抓取和振动建模，实现了安全有效的自动化精确授粉。

Abstract: Robotic pollination offers a promising alternative to manual labor and
bumblebee-assisted methods in controlled agriculture, where wind-driven
pollination is absent and regulatory restrictions limit the use of commercial
pollinators. In this work, we present and validate a vision-guided robotic
framework that uses data from an end-effector mounted RGB-D sensor and combines
3D plant reconstruction, targeted grasp planning, and physics-based vibration
modeling to enable precise pollination. First, the plant is reconstructed in 3D
and registered to the robot coordinate frame to identify obstacle-free grasp
poses along the main stem. Second, a discrete elastic rod model predicts the
relationship between actuation parameters and flower dynamics, guiding the
selection of optimal pollination strategies. Finally, a manipulator with soft
grippers grasps the stem and applies controlled vibrations to induce pollen
release. End-to-end experiments demonstrate a 92.5\% main-stem grasping success
rate, and simulation-guided optimization of vibration parameters further
validates the feasibility of our approach, ensuring that the robot can safely
and effectively perform pollination without damaging the flower. To our
knowledge, this is the first robotic system to jointly integrate vision-based
grasping and vibration modeling for automated precision pollination.

Abstract: Hair care is an essential daily activity, yet it remains inaccessible to
individuals with limited mobility and challenging for autonomous robot systems
due to the fine-grained physical structure and complex dynamics of hair. In
this work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We
introduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric
quantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing
mechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to
improve generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a
novel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen
hairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral
(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair
styling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model
outperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen
hairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling
tasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error
and 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system. Real-world
experiments exhibit zero-shot transferability of our system to wigs, achieving
consistent success on challenging unseen hairstyles where the state-of-the-art
system fails. Together, these results introduce a foundation for model-based
robot hair care, advancing toward more generalizable, flexible, and accessible
robot hair styling in unconstrained physical environments. More details are

Abstract: Recent advances in control robot methods, from end-to-end
vision-language-action frameworks to modular systems with predefined
primitives, have advanced robots' ability to follow natural language
instructions. Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse
environments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited
interpretability.In this work, we introduce EmbodiedCoder, a training-free
framework for open-world mobile robot manipulation that leverages coding models
to directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level
instructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry
parameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data
collection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and
generalizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real
mobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across
diverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and
environments.Our results demonstrate an interpretable approach for bridging
high-level reasoning and low-level control, moving beyond fixed primitives
toward versatile robot intelligence. See the project page at:
