Distilling multiple VFMs into a\nunified representation for policy can mitigate this limitation but often yields\ninflexible task-specific feature selection and requires costly full re-training\nto incorporate robot-domain knowledge. We propose VER, a Vision Expert\ntransformer for Robot learning. During pretraining, VER distills multiple VFMs\ninto a vision expert library. It then fine-tunes only a lightweight routing\nnetwork (fewer than 0.4% of parameters) to dynamically select task-relevant\nexperts from the pretrained library for downstream robot tasks. We further\nintroduce Patchwise Expert Routing with Curriculum Top-K Annealing to improve\nboth flexibility and precision of dynamic expert selection. Moreover, VER\nsupports parameter-efficient finetuning for scalable expert utilization and\nadaptive robot-domain knowledge integration. Across 17 diverse robotic tasks\nand multiple policy heads, VER achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We\nintroduce a novel automated microscopic system powered by DeepAf, a novel\nauto-focus framework that uniquely combines spatial and spectral features\nthrough a hybrid architecture for single-shot focus prediction. The proposed\nnetwork automatically regresses the distance to the optimal focal point using\nthe extracted spatiospectral features and adjusts the control parameters for\noptimal image outcomes.

Through systematic evaluation across\nmultiple configurations (varying trap detection probabilities, exploitation\ndifficulty thresholds, and training regimens), the results demonstrate that\ndefender observability and trap effectiveness create substantial barriers to\nsuccessful attacks. The experiments reveal that reward shaping and careful\ntraining scheduling are critical for learning stability in this adversarial\nsetting.

A subsequent surrogate-based evaluation revealed that 77.2\\% of\nthese valid designs achieved superior performance compared to the single\noptimal design found by the SBO baseline.

In this paper,\nwe decompose the inference process into the encoding, denoising, and decoding\nstages, and observe that cache-based acceleration methods often lead to\nsubstantial memory surges in the latter two stages. To address this problem, we\nanalyze the characteristics of inference across different stages and propose\nstage-specific strategies for reducing memory consumption: 1) Asynchronous\nCache Swapping. 2) Feature chunk. 3) Slicing latents to decode.

Among existing neuron models, the Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron has become widely adopted in deep SNNs due to\nits simplicity and computational efficiency.

In contrast, more complex models, such as the Quadratic\nIntegrate-and-Fire (QIF) neuron, exhibit richer, nonlinear dynamics but have\nseen limited adoption due to their training instability. On that note, we\npropose the first discretization of the QIF neuron model tailored for\nhigh-performance deep spiking neural networks and provide an in-depth analysis\nof its dynamics. To ensure training stability, we derive an analytical\nformulation for surrogate gradient windows directly from our discretizations'\nparameter set, minimizing gradient mismatch.

In this work, we propose \"ArchitectHead\", the first framework for\ncreating 3D Gaussian head avatars that support continuous control over LOD.

KV quantization is a key\nlever for reducing cache cost, but accuracy drops sharply as the native KV\ndistribution lacks flatness and thus maintains a wide quantization range. Prior\nwork focuses on isolating outliers, which caps their error but fails to flatten\nthe overall distribution, leaving performance fragile under low-bit settings.\nIn this work, we show that the K cache maintains a stable structure that\nevolves gradually with context, while the V cache carries latent semantic\nregularities. Building on these insights, we propose PatternKV, a\npattern-aligned residual quantization scheme.

This capability would be particularly beneficial\nin elementary and middle-school mathematics education, where most work remains\nhandwritten, because seeing students' full working of a problem provides\nvaluable insights into their learning processes, but is extremely\ntime-consuming to grade. We present two experiments investigating MLLM\nperformance on handwritten student mathematics classwork. Experiment A examines\n288 handwritten responses from Ghanaian middle school students solving\narithmetic problems with objective answers. In this context, models achieved\nnear-human accuracy (95%, k = 0.90) but exhibited occasional errors that human\neducators would be unlikely to make. Experiment B evaluates 150 mathematical\nillustrations from American elementary students, where the drawings are the\nanswer to the question. These tasks lack single objective answers and require\nsophisticated visual interpretation as well as pedagogical judgment in order to\nanalyze and evaluate them. We attempted to separate MLLMs' visual capabilities\nfrom their pedagogical abilities by first asking them to grade the student\nillustrations directly, and then by augmenting the image with a detailed human\ndescription of the illustration. We found that when the models had to analyze\nthe student illustrations directly, they struggled, achieving only k = 0.20\nwith ground truth scores, but when given human descriptions, their agreement\nlevels improved dramatically to k = 0.47, which was in line with human-to-human\nagreement levels.

Recently, language-driven grasp generation has emerged as a\npromising direction due to its practical interaction capabilities.

Moreover, current grasp\nfoundation models tend to overemphasize dialog and object semantics, resulting\nin inferior performance and restriction to single-object grasping. To maintain\nstrong reasoning ability and generalization in cluttered environments, we\npropose VCoT-Grasp, an end-to-end grasp foundation model that incorporates\nvisual chain-of-thought reasoning to enhance visual understanding for grasp\ngeneration.

Existing co-design frameworks typically optimize\nfor either maximum height or minimum energy, neglecting their trade-off.

The proposed method explicitly incorporates realistic actuator mass\nmodels and optimizes mechanical design (including gearbox) and control\nparameters within a unified framework.

Both methods achieve a provable\nconvergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log K / K)$, while the learning-aware\napproach attains a tighter $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ constant and further benefits from\nan adaptive step-size selection enabled by a backtracking strategy.\nFurthermore, we extend the framework to problems where the learning problem\nadmits multiple optimal solutions, showing that our modified algorithm for a\nstructured setting achieves an $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$ rate.

However, computing the exact constant\nis NP-hard, and standard approaches to estimate the Lipschitz constant involve\nsolving a large matrix semidefinite program (SDP) that scales poorly with\nnetwork size. Further, there is a potential to efficiently leverage local\ninformation on the input region to provide tighter Lipschitz estimates. We\naddress this problem here by proposing a compositional framework that yields\ntight yet scalable Lipschitz estimates for deep feedforward neural networks.\nSpecifically, we begin by developing a generalized SDP framework that is highly\nflexible, accommodating heterogeneous activation function slope, and allowing\nLipschitz estimates with respect to arbitrary input-output pairs and arbitrary\nchoices of sub-networks of consecutive layers. We then decompose this\ngeneralized SDP into a sequence of small sub-problems, with computational\ncomplexity that scales linearly with respect to the network depth.

Next, we develop a\nseries of algorithms, termed as ECLipsE-Gen-Local, that effectively incorporate\nlocal information on the input. Our experiments demonstrate that our algorithms\nachieve substantial speedups over a multitude of benchmarks while producing\nsignificantly tighter Lipschitz bounds than global approaches.

Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire\nspecialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great\nutility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two\nsecurity-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make\nthem infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network\nconnection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the\nsystem vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a\nsensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms\nproduce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work\naddresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private\noptimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language\nmodels.

Yet, their deployment remains\nlimited by (i) the absence of automated geospatial data pipelines and (ii) the\nlarge size of fine-tuned models. Existing GFMs lack workflows for processing\nraw satellite imagery, and downstream adaptations often retain the full\ncomplexity of the original encoder.\n  We present InstaGeo, an open-source, end-to-end framework that addresses\nthese challenges by integrating: (1) automated data curation to transform raw\nimagery into model-ready datasets; (2) task-specific model distillation to\nderive compact, compute-efficient models; and (3) seamless deployment as\ninteractive web-map applications. Using InstaGeo, we reproduced datasets from\nthree published studies and trained models with marginal mIoU differences of\n-0.73 pp for flood mapping, -0.20 pp for crop segmentation, and +1.79 pp for\ndesert locust prediction. The distilled models are up to 8x smaller than\nstandard fine-tuned counterparts, reducing FLOPs and CO2 emissions with minimal\naccuracy loss.\n  Leveraging InstaGeo's streamlined data pipeline, we also curated a larger\ncrop segmentation dataset, achieving a state-of-the-art mIoU of 60.65%, a 12 pp\nimprovement over prior baselines. Moreover, InstaGeo enables users to progress\nfrom raw data to model deployment within a single working day.\n  By unifying data preparation, model compression, and deployment, InstaGeo\ntransforms research-grade GFMs into practical, low-carbon tools for real-time,\nlarge-scale Earth observation.

Recently,\nfrequency-domain artifacts (particularly periodic peaks in the magnitude\nspectrum), have received significant attention, as they have been often\nconsidered a strong indicator of synthetic image generation. However,\nstate-of-the-art detectors are typically used as black-boxes, and it still\nremains unclear whether they truly rely on these peaks. This limits their\ninterpretability and trust.

In\nthis work, we present DYMO-Hair, a model-based robot hair care system. We\nintroduce a novel dynamics learning paradigm that is suited for volumetric\nquantities such as hair, relying on an action-conditioned latent state editing\nmechanism, coupled with a compact 3D latent space of diverse hairstyles to\nimprove generalizability. This latent space is pre-trained at scale using a\nnovel hair physics simulator, enabling generalization across previously unseen\nhairstyles. Using the dynamics model with a Model Predictive Path Integral\n(MPPI) planner, DYMO-Hair is able to perform visual goal-conditioned hair\nstyling. Experiments in simulation demonstrate that DYMO-Hair's dynamics model\noutperforms baselines on capturing local deformation for diverse, unseen\nhairstyles. DYMO-Hair further outperforms baselines in closed-loop hair styling\ntasks on unseen hairstyles, with an average of 22% lower final geometric error\nand 42% higher success rate than the state-of-the-art system.

However, its reliance on a fixed\ntemperature parameter leads to suboptimal training on diverse preference data,\ncausing overfitting on easy examples and under-learning from informative ones.\nRecent methods have emerged to counter this. While IPO addresses general\noverfitting, its uniform regularization can be overly conservative. The more\ntargeted approach of $\\beta$-DPO suffers from its own limitations: its\nbatch-level adaptation applies a single, compromised temperature to\nmixed-margin pairs, its linear update rule can produce unstable negative\n$\\beta$ values, and its filtering mechanism discards potentially useful\ntraining signals. In this work, we introduce Margin-Adaptive Direct Preference\nOptimization (MADPO), a method that provides a stable, data-preserving, and\ninstance-level solution. MADPO employs a practical two-step approach: it first\ntrains a reward model to estimate preference margins and then uses these\nmargins to apply a continuous, adaptive weight to the DPO loss for each\nindividual training sample. This re-weighting scheme creates an effective\ntarget margin that is amplified for hard pairs and dampened for easy pairs,\nallowing for granular control over the learning signal. We provide a\ncomprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that MADPO has a well-behaved\noptimization landscape and is robust to reward model estimation errors. We\nvalidate our theory with experiments on a sentiment generation task, where\nMADPO consistently and significantly outperforms strong baselines across\ndatasets of varying quality.

Infrequent communication strategies (e.g., Local SGD) reduce this\noverhead but, when applied to adaptive optimizers, often suffer a performance\ngap relative to fully synchronous DDP. We trace this gap to a time-scale\nmismatch: the optimizer's fast-moving momentum, tuned for frequent updates,\ndecays too quickly to smooth gradients over long intervals, leading to\nnoise-dominated optimization. To address this, we propose MT-DAO, a family of\noptimizers that employs multiple slow- and fast-moving first momenta or the\ngradient to track update dynamics across different time scales, for which we\nprovide the first convergence guarantees. Empirically, for language-model\npre-training, this eliminates the performance gap with DDP, outperforming\ninfrequent-communication baselines in perplexity and reducing iso-token\nwall-clock time by 6-27% on Ethernet interconnects.

Our dataset was constructed following a pseudo-labeling approach, in\nwhich raw video data was automatically clustered into coherent shot segments.\nWe show that our models outperformed previous baselines in detecting cut points\nand provide competitive visual shot selection, advancing the state of the art\nin multimodal automated video editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u8f91\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u53e4\u5178\u97f3\u4e50\u4f1a\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f55\u65f6\u526a\u5207\u548c\u5982\u4f55\u526a\u5207\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u5c11\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u53e4\u5178\u97f3\u4e50\u4f1a\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\uff08\u4f55\u65f6\u526a\u5207\uff09\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\uff08\u5982\u4f55\u526a\u5207\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5377\u79ef-Transformer\u7ba1\u9053\u548cCLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u526a\u5207\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u955c\u5934\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u9886\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

To achieve this, a novel image analysis pipeline\nwas developed.

A key innovation of the method lies in\nits temporal integration: each analysis step considers not only the current\nstatus but also their developmental across prior time points. This approach\nenables robust discrimination of individual seedlings, especially when\noverlapping leaves significantly hinder object separation. The method\ndemonstrated high accuracy in seedling counting and vigor assessment, even in\nchallenging scenarios characterized by dense and intertwined growth.

In contrast, ViTs rely on spatial patchification, which\ninevitably lacks semantic information. To bridge this gap, we propose to\ndirectly model \"object\" as the visual equivalence of \"word,\" pushing the model\nto learn the global context and semantics among visual elements. We investigate\nour hypotheses via masked image modeling (MIM), a framework where our approach\ncan be readily tested by applying masks to visual objects rather than random\npatches. Considerable evidence from qualitative and quantitative evaluations\nreveals a key finding: object-level representation alone helps to learn a\nreal-world distribution, whereas pixel-averaging shortcuts are often learned\nwithout it. Moreover, further evaluations with multimodal LLMs (MLLM) on visual\nquestion answering (VQA, GQA, ScienceQA) tasks demonstrate the strong reasoning\nand contextual understanding gained with this simple objective.

Accurate forecasting of their proton\nflux time profiles is crucial for early warnings and mitigation. This paper\nexplores deep learning sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models based on Long\nShort-Term Memory networks to predict 24-hour proton flux profiles following\nSPE onsets. We used a dataset of 40 well-connected SPEs (1997-2017) observed by\nNOAA GOES, each associated with a >=M-class western-hemisphere solar flare and\nundisturbed proton flux profiles. Using 4-fold stratified cross-validation, we\nevaluate seq2seq model configurations (varying hidden units and embedding\ndimensions) under multiple forecasting scenarios: (i) proton-only input vs.\ncombined proton+X-ray input, (ii) original flux data vs. trend-smoothed data,\nand (iii) autoregressive vs. one-shot forecasting. Our major results are as\nfollows: First, one-shot forecasting consistently yields lower error than\nautoregressive prediction, avoiding the error accumulation seen in iterative\napproaches. Second, on the original data, proton-only models outperform\nproton+X-ray models. However, with trend-smoothed data, this gap narrows or\nreverses in proton+X-ray models. Third, trend-smoothing significantly enhances\nthe performance of proton+X-ray models by mitigating fluctuations in the X-ray\nchannel. Fourth, while models trained on trendsmoothed data perform best on\naverage, the best-performing model was trained on original data, suggesting\nthat architectural choices can sometimes outweigh the benefits of data\npreprocessing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLSTM\u7684seq2seq\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08SPEs\uff09\u768424\u5c0f\u65f6\u8d28\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5256\u9762\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u9633\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u536b\u661f\u3001\u5b87\u822a\u5458\u548c\u6280\u672f\u7cfb\u7edf\u9020\u6210\u4e25\u91cd\u8f90\u5c04\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u8d28\u5b50\u901a\u91cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5256\u9762\u5bf9\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752840\u4e2aSPE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff081997-2017\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc74\u6298\u5206\u5c42\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540cseq2seq\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8f93\u5165\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u8d28\u5b50\u6216\u8d28\u5b50+X\u5c04\u7ebf\uff09\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u6216\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e73\u6ed1\uff09\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6216\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8d28\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8d28\u5b50+X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e73\u6ed1\u540e\u5dee\u8ddd\u7f29\u5c0f\u6216\u53cd\u8f6c\uff1b\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e73\u6ed1\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8d28\u5b50+X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u65f6\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u8d8b\u52bf\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bf9\u8d28\u5b50+X\u5c04\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002"}}

To address\nthese challenges, we implement Parameter-efficient Split Learning, which\neffectively balances efficiency and performance for collaborative training on\nlow-resource devices.\n  To reduce communication overhead in collaborative training, we introduce\nAdaptive Mixed bit Activation Quantization (AMAQ), a strategy that\nprogressively compresses activations and gradients from high precision (6 to 8\nbits) to low precision (3 to 4 bits). AMAQ achieves this by effectively\nallocating bit budgets across channels based on feature wise and layer wise\nimportance using bit regularization.\n  Under the same bit budgets, AMAQ outperforms fixed-precision approaches,\ndelivering about 2.5% higher generation accuracy and about 1.3% better\nclassification accuracy for models like LLaMA3 8B and Qwen2.5 7B. In addition,\nit significantly enhances training stability and reducing ultra-low bit\nrepresentation collapse during the training.\n  Experiments demonstrate that AMAQ integrates effectively into practical\nmulti-machine collaborative training setups, offering superior inference\naccuracy with only a modest communication overhead for bits adaptation during\ntraining.

Accurate cardiac keyframe detection can\neliminate this problem. However, automatic methods solely derive end-systole\n(ES) and end-diastole (ED) frames from left ventricular volume curves, which do\nnot provide a deeper insight into myocardial motion. We propose a\nself-supervised deep learning method detecting five keyframes in short-axis\n(SAX) and four-chamber long-axis (4CH) cine CMR. Initially, dense deformable\nregistration fields are derived from the images and used to compute a 1D motion\ndescriptor, which provides valuable insights into global cardiac contraction\nand relaxation patterns. From these characteristic curves, keyframes are\ndetermined using a simple set of rules. The method was independently evaluated\nfor both views using three public, multicentre, multidisease datasets.

Furthermore, generalisability to\npatients with rare congenital heart defects was tested using the German\nCompetence Network (GCN) dataset. Our self-supervised approach achieved\nimproved detection accuracy by 30% - 51% for SAX and 11% - 47% for 4CH in ED\nand ES, as measured by cyclic frame difference (cFD), compared with the\nvolume-based approach.

Batley", "Sourav Saha"], "title": "The Method of Infinite Descent", "comment": null, "summary": "Training - the optimisation of complex models - is traditionally performed\nthrough small, local, iterative updates [D. E. Rumelhart, G. E. Hinton, R. J.\nWilliams, Nature 323, 533-536 (1986)]. Approximating solutions through\ntruncated gradients is a paradigm dating back to Cauchy [A.-L. Cauchy, Comptes\nRendus Math\\'ematique 25, 536-538 (1847)] and Newton [I. Newton, The Method of\nFluxions and Infinite Series (Henry Woodfall, London, 1736)]. This work\nintroduces the Method of Infinite Descent, a semi-analytic optimisation\nparadigm that reformulates training as the direct solution to the first-order\noptimality condition. By analytical resummation of its Taylor expansion, this\nmethod yields an exact, algebraic equation for the update step. Realisation of\nthe infinite Taylor tower's cascading resummation is formally derived, and an\nexploitative algorithm for the direct solve step is proposed.\n  This principle is demonstrated with the herein-introduced AION (Analytic,\nInfinitely-Optimisable Network) architecture. AION is a model designed\nexpressly to satisfy the algebraic closure required by Infinite Descent. In a\nsimple test problem, AION reaches the optimum in a single descent step.\nTogether, this optimiser-model pair exemplify how analytic structure enables\nexact, non-iterative convergence.

In contrast to manufacturing, anomaly detection in retail logistics\nfaces new challenges, particularly in the diversity and variability of object\npose and appearance. Leading anomaly detection methods fall short when applied\nto this new setting. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new benchmark that\novercomes the current limitations of existing datasets. With over 230,000\nimages (and more than 29,000 defective instances), it is 40 times larger than\nMVTec-AD and contains more than 48,000 distinct objects. To validate the\ndifficulty of the problem, we conduct an extensive evaluation of multiple\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection methods, demonstrating that they do not\nsurpass 56.96% AUROC on our dataset.

These challenges highlight the need for a\nframework that can integrate feature selection knowledge across clients without\nexposing sensitive information. In this extended journal version, we advance\nthe framework from two perspectives: 1) developing a privacy-preserving\nknowledge fusion strategy to derive a unified representation space without\nsharing sensitive raw data. 2) incorporating a sample-aware weighting strategy\nto address distributional imbalance among heterogeneous local clients.\nExtensive experiments validate the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of\nour framework.

We show that a simple token-based InfoRMIA\ncan pinpoint which tokens are memorized within generated outputs, thereby\nlocalizing leakage from the sequence level down to individual tokens, while\nachieving stronger sequence-level inference power on LLMs. This new scope\nrethinks privacy in LLMs and can lead to more targeted mitigation, such as\nexact unlearning.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfoRMIA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5RMIA\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u4ee5\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5b9a\u4f4dLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faInfoRMIA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5177\u4f53\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "InfoRMIA\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eRMIA\uff0c\u4e14\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u80fd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u5206\u6790\u4e3aLLM\u9690\u79c1\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u3002"}}

In particular, we\nobserve that most commercial VLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) fail to\neffectively solve CAPTCHAs and thus achieve low accuracy (around 21.9 percent).\nHowever, our findings indicate that requiring the model to perform step-by-step\nreasoning before generating the final coordinates can significantly enhance its\nsolving accuracy, underscoring the severity of the gap. To systematically study\nthis issue, we introduce CAPTCHA-X, the first real-world CAPTCHA benchmark with\nreasoning, covering seven categories of CAPTCHAs (such as Gobang, hCaptcha,\netc.) with step-by-step action solutions and grounding annotations. We further\ndefine five reasoning-oriented metrics that enable a comprehensive evaluation\nof models reasoning capabilities. To validate the effectiveness of reasoning,\nwe also propose a general agentic VLM-based framework that incorporates the\nmodels inherent reasoning abilities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across five high-difficulty CAPTCHA types, with an average solving\naccuracy of 83.9 percent, substantially surpassing existing baselines.

Our approach includes\nthree main innovations: (1) A robust phenotype representation that merges\ncritical patches with global context, harmonized with genomic data to minimize\nlocal bias. (2) An Exponential Prototype Update Strategy (EMA ProtoUp) that\nsustains stable cross-modal associations and employs a wandering mechanism to\nadapt prototypes flexibly to tumor heterogeneity. (3) A hierarchical prototype\nmatching scheme designed to capture global centrality, local typicality, and\ncohort-level trends, thereby refining prototype inference. Comprehensive\nevaluations on four publicly available cancer datasets indicate that our method\nsurpasses current leading unimodal and multimodal survival prediction\ntechniques in both accuracy and interoperability, providing a new perspective\non prototype learning for critical medical applications.

By aggregating surrogate attributions together with their\ndispersion, QGraphLIME yields uncertainty-aware node and edge importance\nrankings for quantum graph models. The framework further provides a\ndistribution-free, finite-sample guarantee on the size of the surrogate\nensemble: a Dvoretzky-Kiefer-Wolfowitz bound ensures uniform approximation of\nthe induced distribution of a binary class probability at target accuracy and\nconfidence under standard independence assumptions.

However, these approaches are\nfundamentally limited in their ability to approximate full attention: they fail\nto provide consistent approximations across heads and query vectors and, most\ncritically, lack guarantees on approximation quality, limiting their practical\ndeployment. We observe that top-$k$ and random sampling are complementary:\ntop-$k$ performs well when attention scores are dominated by a few tokens,\nwhereas random sampling provides better estimates when attention scores are\nrelatively uniform. Building on this insight and leveraging the statistical\nguarantees of sampling, we introduce vAttention, the first practical sparse\nattention mechanism with user-specified $(\\epsilon, \\delta)$ guarantees on\napproximation accuracy (thus, verified). These guarantees make vAttention a\ncompelling step toward practical, reliable deployment of sparse attention at\nscale. By unifying top-k and sampling, vAttention outperforms both\nindividually, delivering a superior quality-efficiency trade-off.

While there have been\nseveral recent works studying safe alignment of LLMs, these works either\nrequire the training of reward and cost models and incur high memory and\ncomputational costs, or need prior knowledge about the optimal solution.\nMotivated by this fact, we study the problem of constrained alignment in LLMs,\ni.e., maximizing the output reward while restricting the cost due to\npotentially unsafe content to stay below a threshold. For this problem, we\npropose a novel primal-dual DPO approach, which first trains a model using\nstandard DPO on reward preference data to provide reward information, and then\nadopts a rearranged Lagrangian DPO objective utilizing the provided reward\ninformation to fine-tune LLMs on cost preference data. Our approach\nsignificantly reduces memory and computational costs, and does not require\nextra prior knowledge. Moreover, we establish rigorous theoretical guarantees\non the suboptimality and constraint violation of the output policy. We also\nextend our approach to an online data setting by incorporating exploration\nbonuses, which enables our approach to explore uncovered prompt-response space,\nand then provide theoretical results that get rid of the dependence on\npreference data coverage.

The core challenge\nof RVOS is to anchor abstract linguistic concepts onto a specific set of pixels\nand continuously segment them through the complex dynamics of a video.

However, this cascaded design creates an\ninformation bottleneck by simplifying semantics into coarse geometric prompts\n(e.g, point), and struggles to maintain temporal consistency as the segmenting\nprocess is often decoupled from the initial language grounding.

A Causal Perspective", "comment": null, "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in node\nclassification. Building on this progress, heterogeneous graph neural networks\n(HGNNs) integrate relation types and node and edge semantics to leverage\nheterogeneous information. Causal analysis for HGNNs is advancing rapidly,\naiming to separate genuine causal effects from spurious correlations. However,\nwhether HGNNs are intrinsically effective remains underexamined, and most\nstudies implicitly assume rather than establish this effectiveness. In this\nwork, we examine HGNNs from two perspectives: model architecture and\nheterogeneous information. We conduct a systematic reproduction across 21\ndatasets and 20 baselines, complemented by comprehensive hyperparameter\nretuning. To further disentangle the source of performance gains, we develop a\ncausal effect estimation framework that constructs and evaluates candidate\nfactors under standard assumptions through factual and counterfactual analyses,\nwith robustness validated via minimal sufficient adjustment sets, cross-method\nconsistency checks, and sensitivity analyses.

To achieve this, we collect both synthetic videos rendered\nby Blender and real-world recordings, ensuring that scenes and actions are\nvisually and temporally aligned.

Particle Filtering (PF) has emerged as a strong\nITS method for complex mathematical reasoning tasks, but it is vulnerable when\nguided by process reward models, which often assign overconfident scores early\nin the reasoning process. This causes PF to suffer from premature exploitation:\nit myopically commits to locally promising trajectories, prunes potentially\ncorrect hypotheses, and converges to suboptimal solutions. This failure mode,\nknown as particle impoverishment, is especially severe under constrained\ncomputational budgets. To address this, we analyze the problem and identify two\nroot causes: a lack of diversity in the particle set due to overconfident\nresampling and consequent inability to assess the potential of a reasoning\npath. We introduce Entropic Particle Filtering (ePF), an algorithm that\nintegrates two new techniques to solve these issues. The first technique,\nEntropic Annealing (EA), directly mitigates particle impoverishment by\nmonitoring search diversity via entropy; when diversity drops, it intervenes by\ndynamically annealing the resampling distribution to preserve exploration. The\nsecond, an enhancement called Look-ahead Modulation (LaM), adds a predictive\nguide to evaluate a state's potential based on its successors. On several\nchallenging math benchmarks, ePF significantly outperforms strong baselines and\nachieves up to a 50 % relative improvement in task reward.

While traditional\nmesh-based simulations are precise, they are often computationally expensive\nand require knowledge of physical parameters, such as material properties.

Specifically, our analysis\nis based on a new metric (Mean Average Squared Distance - $MASED$) to quantify\nthe extent of oversmoothing. We derive layer-wise bounds on $MASED$, which\naggregate to yield global upper and lower distance bounds. Based on this\nquantification of oversmoothing, we further analyze the importance of two\ndifferent properties of the model; namely the norms of the generated node\nembeddings, along with the largest and smallest singular values of the weight\nmatrices. Building on the insights drawn from the theoretical analysis, we show\nthat oversmoothing increases as the number of trainable weight matrices and the\nnumber of adjacency matrices increases. We also use the derived layer-wise\nbounds on $MASED$ to form a proposal for decoupling the number of hops (i.e.,\nadjacency depth) from the number of weight matrices. In particular, we\nintroduce G-Reg, a regularization scheme that increases the bounds, and\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments that by doing so node classification\naccuracy increases, achieving robustness at large depths. We further show that\nby reducing oversmoothing in deep networks, we can achieve better results in\nsome tasks than using shallow ones. Specifically, we experiment with a ``cold\nstart\" scenario, i.e., when there is no feature information for the unlabeled\nnodes. Finally, we show empirically the trade-off between receptive field size\n(i.e., number of weight matrices) and performance, using the $MASED$ bounds.\nThis is achieved by distributing adjacency hops across a small number of\ntrainable layers, avoiding the extremes of under- or over-parameterization of\nthe GNN.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff08MASED\uff09\u91cf\u5316GNN\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u8303\u6570\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86G-Reg\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08GNN\uff09\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u6210\u56e0\u53ca\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMASED\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8282\u70b9\u5d4c\u5165\u8303\u6570\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1G-Reg\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eG-Reg\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u8282\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u201c\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u201d\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7MASED\u6307\u6807\u548cG-Reg\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86GNN\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While these techniques aim to reduce size and computational cost\nwithout sacrificing performance, their evaluations have traditionally focused\non the trade-off between size and accuracy, overlooking the aspect of model\nfaithfulness. This limited view is insufficient for high-stakes domains like\nhealthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where compressed models must remain\nfaithful to the behavior of their original counterparts. This paper presents a\nnovel approach to evaluating faithfulness in compressed models, moving beyond\nstandard metrics. We introduce and demonstrate a set of faithfulness metrics\nthat capture how model behavior changes post-compression. Our contributions\ninclude introducing techniques to assess predictive consistency between the\noriginal and compressed models using model agreement, and applying chi-squared\ntests to detect statistically significant changes in predictive patterns across\nboth the overall dataset and demographic subgroups, thereby exposing shifts\nthat aggregate fairness metrics may obscure.

However, realizing this\nvision remains challenging due to substantial memory and compute demands, as\nwell as limited visibility into performance-efficiency trade-offs on\nresource-constrained hardware. We propose lm-Meter, the first lightweight,\nonline latency profiler tailored for on-device LLM inference. lm-Meter captures\nfine-grained, real-time latency at both phase (e.g., embedding, prefill,\ndecode, softmax, sampling) and kernel levels without auxiliary devices. We\nimplement lm-Meter on commercial mobile platforms and demonstrate its high\nprofiling accuracy with minimal system overhead, e.g., only 2.58% throughput\nreduction in prefill and 0.99% in decode under the most constrained Powersave\ngovernor. Leveraging lm-Meter, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies\nrevealing phase- and kernel-level bottlenecks in on-device LLM inference,\nquantifying accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, and identifying systematic\noptimization opportunities. lm-Meter provides unprecedented visibility into the\nruntime behavior of LLMs on constrained platforms, laying the foundation for\ninformed optimization and accelerating the democratization of on-device LLM\nsystems.

While HP\nguarantees are extensively studied in centralized settings, much less is\nunderstood in the decentralized, networked setup. Existing HP studies in\ndecentralized settings impose strong assumptions, like uniformly bounded\ngradients, or asymptotically vanishing noise, resulting in a significant gap\nbetween assumptions used to establish convergence in the HP and the\nmean-squared error (MSE) sense, even for vanilla Decentralized Stochastic\nGradient Descent ($\\mathtt{DSGD}$) algorithm. This is contrary to centralized\nsettings, where it is known that $\\mathtt{SGD}$ converges in HP under the same\nconditions on the cost function as needed to guarantee MSE convergence.\nMotivated by this observation, we revisit HP guarantees for $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ in\nthe presence of light-tailed noise. We show that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ converges in\nHP under the same conditions on the cost as in the MSE sense, removing\nuniformly bounded gradients and other restrictive assumptions, while\nsimultaneously achieving order-optimal rates for both non-convex and strongly\nconvex costs. Moreover, our improved analysis yields linear speed-up in the\nnumber of users, demonstrating that $\\mathtt{DSGD}$ maintains strong\nperformance in the HP sense and matches existing MSE guarantees. Our improved\nresults stem from a careful analysis of the MGF of quantities of interest\n(norm-squared of gradient or optimality gap) and the MGF of the consensus gap\nbetween users' models.

Traditional approaches rely on expensive\nhuman-in-the-loop data, which limits scalability. We propose using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) as policy-agnostic human proxies to generate synthetic\ndata that mimics human decision-making. To evaluate this, we conduct three\nexperiments in a grid-world capture game inspired by Stag Hunt, a game theory\nparadigm that balances risk and reward. In Experiment 1, we compare decisions\nfrom 30 human participants and 2 expert judges with outputs from LLaMA 3.1 and\nMixtral 8x22B models. LLMs, prompted with game-state observations and reward\nstructures, align more closely with experts than participants, demonstrating\nconsistency in applying underlying decision criteria. Experiment 2 modifies\nprompts to induce risk-sensitive strategies (e.g. \"be risk averse\").

However, the\ntrajectories of search agents are structurally heterogeneous, where variations\nin the number, placement, and outcomes of search calls lead to fundamentally\ndifferent answer directions and reward distributions. Standard policy gradient\nmethods, which use a single global baseline, suffer from what we identify and\nformalize as cross-stratum bias-an \"apples-to-oranges\" comparison of\nheterogeneous trajectories. This cross-stratum bias distorts credit assignment\nand hinders exploration of complex, multi-step search strategies. To address\nthis, we propose Stratified GRPO, whose central component, Stratified Advantage\nNormalization (SAN), partitions trajectories into homogeneous strata based on\ntheir structural properties and computes advantages locally within each\nstratum. This ensures that trajectories are evaluated only against their true\npeers. Our analysis proves that SAN eliminates cross-stratum bias, yields\nconditionally unbiased unit-variance estimates inside each stratum, and retains\nthe global unbiasedness and unit-variance properties enjoyed by standard\nnormalization, resulting in a more pure and scale-stable learning signal. To\nimprove practical stability under finite-sample regimes, we further linearly\nblend SAN with the global estimator. Extensive experiments on diverse\nsingle-hop and multi-hop question-answering benchmarks demonstrate that\nStratified GRPO consistently and substantially outperforms GRPO by up to 11.3\npoints, achieving higher training rewards, greater training stability, and more\neffective search policies.
