Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for\ndaily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is\ndiagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.\n  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.\nEffective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly\ninteracting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires\nreliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins\nof highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively\nunderstood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI\nmodels with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge\nextends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these\nsettings before assuming broader decision-making roles.\n  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient\nself-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual\nlimits in overcoming it. As an alternative, we propose a decentralized\narchitecture of interacting small agent networks (SANs). We focus on agents\nrepresenting the specialized substructure of the system, where each agent\ncovers only a subset of the full system functions. Drawing on mathematical\nresults on the learning behavior of SANs and evidence from existing\napplications, we argue that swarm-learning in diverse swarms can enable\nself-adaptive SANs to deliver superior decision-making in dynamic environments\ncompared with monolithic foundation models, though at the cost of reduced\nreproducibility in detail."}

We address this gap by systematically\ncomparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a\ncomputationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this\nanalysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations\nfollows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,\nakin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the\nunderparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more\ninformative than those learned with clean labels, while in the\noverparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our\nresults indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are\nrobust to label noise.

In this paper, we introduce a digital twin-driven metamorphic\ntesting framework that addresses these challenges by creating a virtual replica\nof the self-driving system and its operating environment. By combining digital\ntwin technology with AI-based image generative models such as Stable Diffusion,\nour approach enables the systematic generation of realistic and diverse driving\nscenes. This includes variations in weather, road topology, and environmental\nfeatures, all while maintaining the core semantics of the original scenario.\nThe digital twin provides a synchronized simulation environment where changes\ncan be tested in a controlled and repeatable manner. Within this environment,\nwe define three metamorphic relations inspired by real-world traffic rules and\nvehicle behavior. We validate our framework in the Udacity self-driving\nsimulator and demonstrate that it significantly enhances test coverage and\neffectiveness. Our method achieves the highest true positive rate (0.719), F1\nscore (0.689), and precision (0.662) compared to baseline approaches. This\npaper highlights the value of integrating digital twins with AI-powered\nscenario generation to create a scalable, automated, and high-fidelity testing\nsolution for autonomous vehicle safety."}

We introduce TransFIRA (Transfer\nLearning for Face Image Recognizability Assessment), a lightweight and\nannotation-free framework that grounds recognizability directly in embedding\nspace. TransFIRA delivers three advances: (i) a definition of recognizability\nvia class-center similarity (CCS) and class-center angular separation (CCAS),\nyielding the first natural, decision-boundary--aligned criterion for filtering\nand weighting; (ii) a recognizability-informed aggregation strategy that\nachieves state-of-the-art verification accuracy on BRIAR and IJB-C while nearly\ndoubling correlation with true recognizability, all without external labels,\nheuristics, or backbone-specific training; and (iii) new extensions beyond\nfaces, including encoder-grounded explainability that reveals how degradations\nand subject-specific factors affect recognizability, and the first\nrecognizability-aware body recognition assessment.

Our approach projects 3D points to a 2D\nspherical grid, enriches pixels with multi-source features, and trains an\nensemble of segmentation networks to produce pseudo-labels and uncertainty\nmaps, the latter guiding annotation of ambiguous regions.

Using this\npipeline, we build Mangrove3D, a semantic segmentation TLS dataset for mangrove\nforests. We further evaluate data efficiency and feature importance to address\ntwo key questions: (1) how much annotated data are needed and (2) which\nfeatures matter most. Results show that performance saturates after ~12\nannotated scans, geometric features contribute the most, and compact\nnine-channel stacks capture nearly all discriminative power, with the mean\nIntersection over Union (mIoU) plateauing at around 0.76.

If a\nCT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the\nmodel may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design\nfeatures which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate\nartifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high\nclassification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact\ndata during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for\nartifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification\nperformance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained\nwith labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to\nuniform noise.

By\nrelaxing probabilistic constraints and adopting a flexible parameterization of\nGaussian projections, GMNM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse neural\narchitectures and trained end-to-end with gradient-based methods. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that incorporating GMNM into architectures such as\nMLPs, CNNs, attention mechanisms, and LSTMs consistently improves performance\nover standard baselines. These results highlight GMNM's potential as a powerful\nand flexible module for enhancing efficiency and accuracy across a wide range\nof machine learning applications."}

In\nthis context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on\nexisting low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy. Experimental results on the 2020\nIEEE GRSS Data Fusion Contest dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework compared to standard training strategies."}

Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we\npropose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most\nsuitable models for specific datasets and tasks.

We propose cluster paths, a\npost-hoc interpretability method that clusters activations at selected layers\nand represents each input as its sequence of cluster IDs. To assess these\ncluster paths, we introduce four metrics: path complexity (cognitive load),\nweighted-path purity (class alignment), decision-alignment faithfulness\n(predictive fidelity), and path agreement (stability under perturbations). In a\nspurious-cue CIFAR-10 experiment, cluster paths identify color-based shortcuts\nand collapse when the cue is removed. On a five-class CelebA hair-color task,\nthey achieve 90% faithfulness and maintain 96% agreement under Gaussian noise\nwithout sacrificing accuracy. Scaling to a Vision Transformer pretrained on\nImageNet, we extend cluster paths to concept paths derived from prompting a\nlarge language model on minimal path divergences. Finally, we show that cluster\npaths can serve as an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) detector, reliably\nflagging anomalous samples before the model generates over-confident\npredictions.
