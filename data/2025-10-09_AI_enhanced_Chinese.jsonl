Meta-path scores extracted from this\n8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward\nstochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically\nplausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining\nscore-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces\ntimestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag\ntriples that contain no protected health information. On simulated\nultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by\ngreater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream\npredictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the\nDOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55\nsafe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61\nplus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong\nresistance to re-identification.

Recent work\nhas relaxed these assumptions via latent-space safe control, where state\nrepresentations and dynamics are learned jointly through world models that\nreconstruct future high-dimensional observations (e.g., RGB images) from\ncurrent observations and actions. This enables safety constraints that are\ndifficult to specify analytically (e.g., spilling) to be framed as\nclassification problems in latent space, allowing controllers to operate\ndirectly from raw observations. However, these methods assume that\nsafety-critical features are observable in the learned latent state. We ask:\nwhen are latent state spaces sufficient for safe control? To study this, we\nexamine temperature-based failures, comparable to overheating in cooking or\nmanufacturing tasks, and find that RGB-only observations can produce myopic\nsafety behaviors, e.g., avoiding seeing failure states rather than preventing\nfailure itself.

Instead of costly end-to-end diffusion training, SDAR\nperforms a lightweight paradigm conversion that transforms a well-trained\nautoregressive (AR) model into a blockwise diffusion model through brief,\ndata-efficient adaptation. During inference, SDAR generates sequences\nautoregressively across blocks for global coherence while decoding all tokens\nwithin each block in parallel via a discrete diffusion process. Extensive\nexperiments show that AR models remain substantially more compute-efficient\nthan masked diffusion models, providing a strong foundation for adaptation.\nBuilding on this insight, SDAR achieves efficient AR-to-diffusion conversion\nwith minimal cost, preserving AR-level performance while enabling parallel\ngeneration. Scaling studies across dense and Mixture-of-Experts architectures\nconfirm that SDAR scales without compromise: larger models exhibit stronger\nrobustness to block size and decoding thresholds, yielding greater speedups\nwithout accuracy loss. Beyond efficiency, SDAR demonstrates enhanced reasoning\nand domain adaptability. Our 30B MoE model surpasses its AR counterpart on\nchallenging scientific reasoning benchmarks such as GPQA and ChemBench, and\ngains further improvements under test-time scaling methods like majority voting\nand pass@k.

Nevertheless, many application areas that matter for\ndaily life and society show only modest gains so far; a prominent case is\ndiagnosing and treating dynamically evolving disease in intensive care.\n  The common challenge is adapting complex systems to dynamic environments.\nEffective strategies must optimize outcomes in systems composed of strongly\ninteracting functions while avoiding shared side effects; this requires\nreliable, self-adaptive modeling. These tasks align with building digital twins\nof highly complex systems whose mechanisms are not fully or quantitatively\nunderstood. It is therefore essential to develop methods for self-adapting AI\nmodels with minimal data and limited mechanistic knowledge. As this challenge\nextends beyond medicine, AI should demonstrate clear superiority in these\nsettings before assuming broader decision-making roles.\n  We identify the curse of dimensionality as a fundamental barrier to efficient\nself-adaptation and argue that monolithic foundation models face conceptual\nlimits in overcoming it.

In real-world datasets, these labels are often noisy due to\nannotation errors. While the impact of label noise on the performance of deep\nlearning models has been widely studied, its effects on the networks' hidden\nrepresentations remain poorly understood. We address this gap by systematically\ncomparing hidden representations using the Information Imbalance, a\ncomputationally efficient proxy of conditional mutual information. Through this\nanalysis, we observe that the information content of the hidden representations\nfollows a double descent as a function of the number of network parameters,\nakin to the behavior of the test error. We further demonstrate that in the\nunderparameterized regime, representations learned with noisy labels are more\ninformative than those learned with clean labels, while in the\noverparameterized regime, these representations are equally informative. Our\nresults indicate that the representations of overparameterized networks are\nrobust to label noise. We also found that the information imbalance between the\npenultimate and pre-softmax layers decreases with cross-entropy loss in the\noverparameterized regime. This offers a new perspective on understanding\ngeneralization in classification tasks. Extending our analysis to\nrepresentations learned from random labels, we show that these perform worse\nthan random features.

Yet our understanding of sequential learning remains incomplete,\nparticularly in the multi-trajectory setting where data consists of many\nindependent realizations of a time-indexed stochastic process. This important\nregime both reflects modern training pipelines such as for large foundation\nmodels, and offers the potential for learning without the typical mixing\nassumptions made in the single-trajectory case. However, instance-optimal\nbounds are known only for least-squares regression with dependent covariates;\nfor more general models or loss functions, the only broadly applicable\nguarantees result from a reduction to either i.i.d. learning, with effective\nsample size scaling only in the number of trajectories, or an existing\nsingle-trajectory result when each individual trajectory mixes, with effective\nsample size scaling as the full data budget deflated by the mixing-time.\n  In this work, we significantly broaden the scope of instance-optimal rates in\nmulti-trajectory settings via the Hellinger localization framework, a general\napproach for maximum likelihood estimation. Our method proceeds by first\ncontrolling the squared Hellinger distance at the path-measure level via a\nreduction to i.i.d. learning, followed by localization as a quadratic form in\nparameter space weighted by the trajectory Fisher information. This yields\ninstance-optimal bounds that scale with the full data budget under a broad set\nof conditions. We instantiate our framework across four diverse case studies: a\nsimple mixture of Markov chains, dependent linear regression under non-Gaussian\nnoise, generalized linear models with non-monotonic activations, and\nlinear-attention sequence models.

Furthermore,\na new dataset is created for training the AI models as existing datasets either\ndo not contain depth information or only contain labels for Gaze Point\nEstimation that are not suitable for the task of Gaze Angle Estimation. Various\nmodel configurations are trained, validated and evaluated on a total of three\ndifferent datasets. The trained models are then to be used in a real-time\npipeline to estimate the gaze direction and thus the gaze point of a person in\nfront of a computer screen. The AI model architecture used in this thesis is\nbased on an earlier work by Lian et al.

While many studies have demonstrated\nperformance benefits of combining multiple model predictions, existing\nstrategies using linear pooling methods (ranging from simple averaging to\ndynamic weight updates) face a key limitation. Dynamic prediction combinations\nthat rely on historical performance to update weights are necessarily reactive.\nDue to the need to average over a reasonable number of epochs (with moving\naverages or exponential weighting), they tend to be slow to adjust to changing\ncircumstances (phase or regime changes). In this work, we develop a model that\nuses machine learning to forecast the performance of predictions by models at\neach epoch in a time series. This enables `context-awareness' by assigning\nhigher weight to models that are likely to be more accurate at a given time. We\nshow that adding a performance forecasting worker in a decentralized learning\nnetwork, following a design similar to the Allora network, can improve the\naccuracy of network inferences. Specifically, we find forecasting models that\npredict regret (performance relative to the network inference) or regret\nz-score (performance relative to other workers) show greater improvement than\nmodels predicting losses, which often do not outperform the naive network\ninference (historically weighted average of all inferences). Through a series\nof optimization tests, we show that the performance of the forecasting model\ncan be sensitive to choices in the feature set and number of training epochs.\nThese properties may depend on the exact problem and should be tailored to each\ndomain.

In this work, we present a surprising connection between attention\nsinks and compression valleys, tracing both to the formation of massive\nactivations in the residual stream. We prove theoretically that massive\nactivations necessarily produce representational compression and establish\nbounds on the resulting entropy reduction. Through experiments across several\nmodels (410M-120B parameters), we confirm that when the beginning-of-sequence\ntoken develops extreme activation norms in the middle layers, both compression\nvalleys and attention sinks emerge simultaneously. Targeted ablation studies\nvalidate our theoretical predictions. This unified view motivates us to propose\nthe Mix-Compress-Refine theory of information flow, as an attempt to explain\nhow LLMs organize their computation in depth by controlling attention and\nrepresentational compression via massive activations. Specifically, we posit\nthat Transformer-based LLMs process tokens in three distinct phases: (1) broad\nmixing in the early layers, (2) compressed computation with limited mixing in\nthe middle layers, and (3) selective refinement in the late layers.

Recent\nadvances have enabled language-guided tracking in complex and unstructured\nscenes. However, existing approaches lack explicit spatial reasoning and\neffective temporal memory, causing failures under severe occlusions or in the\npresence of similar-looking distractors. To address these challenges, we\npresent TrackVLA++, a novel Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model that enhances\nembodied visual tracking with two key modules, a spatial reasoning mechanism\nand a Target Identification Memory (TIM). The reasoning module introduces a\nChain-of-Thought paradigm, termed Polar-CoT, which infers the target's relative\nposition and encodes it as a compact polar-coordinate token for action\nprediction. Guided by these spatial priors, the TIM employs a gated update\nstrategy to preserve long-horizon target memory, ensuring spatiotemporal\nconsistency and mitigating target loss during extended occlusions. Extensive\nexperiments show that TrackVLA++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on\npublic benchmarks across both egocentric and multi-camera settings.

Previous state-of-the-art methods often\nface a trade-off between accuracy and speed. Point-based and sparse\nconvolution-based methods are accurate but slow due to the complexity of\nneighbor searching and 3D convolutions. Projection-based methods are faster but\nlose critical geometric information during the 2D projection. Additionally,\nmany recent methods rely on test-time augmentation (TTA) to improve\nperformance, which further slows the inference. Moreover, the pre-processing\nphase across all methods increases execution time and is demanding on embedded\nplatforms. Therefore, we introduce HARP-NeXt, a high-speed and accurate LiDAR\nsemantic segmentation network. We first propose a novel pre-processing\nmethodology that significantly reduces computational overhead. Then, we design\nthe Conv-SE-NeXt feature extraction block to efficiently capture\nrepresentations without deep layer stacking per network stage. We also employ a\nmulti-scale range-point fusion backbone that leverages information at multiple\nabstraction levels to preserve essential geometric details, thereby enhancing\naccuracy. Experiments on the nuScenes and SemanticKITTI benchmarks show that\nHARP-NeXt achieves a superior speed-accuracy trade-off compared to all\nstate-of-the-art methods, and, without relying on ensemble models or TTA, is\ncomparable to the top-ranked PTv3, while running 24$\\times$ faster.

The core\nidea of HSNet is to decompose the global graph into manageable sub-components.\nFirst, we introduce the Constructive Subgraph Set Block (CSSB), which generates\na diverse set of complementary subgraphs. Rather than relying on a single\nmonolithic graph, CSSB captures heterogeneous characteristics of the image by\nmodeling different relational patterns and feature interactions, producing a\nrich ensemble of both local and global graph structures. Subsequently, the\nSubgraph Aggregation Block (SAB) integrates the representations embedded across\nthese subgraphs. Through adaptive weighting and fusion of multi-graph features,\nSAB constructs a comprehensive and discriminative representation that captures\nintricate interdependencies. Furthermore, a Node Sampling Strategy (NSS) is\ndesigned to selectively retain the most salient features, thereby enhancing\naccuracy while reducing computational overhead.

If a\nCT scanner introduces a new artifact not present in the training labels, the\nmodel may misclassify the images. Although modern CT scanners include design\nfeatures which mitigate these artifacts, unanticipated or difficult-to-mitigate\nartifacts can still appear in practice. The direct solution of labeling images\nfrom this new distribution can be costly. As a more accessible alternative,\nthis study evaluates domain adaptation as an approach for training models that\nmaintain classification performance despite new artifacts, even without\ncorresponding labels. We simulate ring artifacts from detector gain error in\nsinogram space and evaluate domain adversarial neural networks (DANN) against\nbaseline and augmentation-based approaches on the OrganAMNIST abdominal CT\ndataset. Our results demonstrate that baseline models trained only on clean\nimages fail to generalize to images with ring artifacts, and traditional\naugmentation with other distortion types provides no improvement on unseen\nartifact domains. In contrast, the DANN approach successfully maintains high\nclassification accuracy on ring artifact images using only unlabeled artifact\ndata during training, demonstrating the viability of domain adaptation for\nartifact robustness. The domain-adapted model achieved classification\nperformance on ring artifact test data comparable to models explicitly trained\nwith labeled artifact images, while also showing unexpected generalization to\nuniform noise.

Due to the diverse shapes and sizes of\nsurface defects, SDD faces two main challenges: intraclass difference and\ninterclass similarity. Existing methods primarily utilize manually designed\nmodels, which require extensive trial and error and often struggle to address\nboth challenges effectively. To overcome this, we propose AutoNAD, an automated\nneural architecture design framework for SDD that jointly searches over\nconvolutions, transformers, and multi-layer perceptrons. This hybrid design\nenables the model to capture both fine-grained local variations and long-range\nsemantic context, addressing the two key challenges while reducing the cost of\nmanual network design. To support efficient training of such a diverse search\nspace, AutoNAD introduces a cross weight sharing strategy, which accelerates\nsupernet convergence and improves subnet performance. Additionally, a\nsearchable multi-level feature aggregation module (MFAM) is integrated to\nenhance multi-scale feature learning.

In\nthis context, weak labels can be gathered in large quantities by leveraging on\nexisting low-resolution or obsolete products. In this paper, we address the\nproblem of training land-cover classifiers using high-resolution imagery (e.g.,\nSentinel-2) and weak low-resolution reference data (e.g., MODIS -derived\nland-cover maps). Inspired by recent works in Deep Multiple Instance Learning\n(DMIL), we propose a method that trains pixel-level multi-class classifiers and\npredicts low-resolution labels (i.e., patch-level classification), where the\nactual high-resolution labels are learned implicitly without direct\nsupervision. This is achieved with flexible pooling layers that are able to\nlink the semantics of the pixels in the high-resolution imagery to the\nlow-resolution reference labels. Then, the Multiple Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem is re-framed in a multi-class and in a multi-label setting. In the\nformer, the low-resolution annotation represents the majority of the pixels in\nthe patch. In the latter, the annotation only provides us information on the\npresence of one of the land-cover classes in the patch and thus multiple labels\ncan be considered valid for a patch at a time, whereas the low-resolution\nlabels provide us only one label. Therefore, the classifier is trained with a\nPositive-Unlabeled Learning (PUL) strategy.

Finally, we find many\ninteresting properties of test-time RL for VLMs: for example, even in extremely\ndata-constrained scenarios, where adaptation is performed on a single randomly\nchosen unlabeled test example, TTRV still yields non-trivial improvements of up\nto 5.5% in recognition tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "TTRV\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u5219\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002TTRV\u65e8\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u8fd9\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6837\u672c\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u8f93\u51fa\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u4f4e\u71b5\uff09\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u548cVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTTRV\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe52.4%\u548c29.8%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534724.6%\u548c10.0%\u3002\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cInternVL 8B\u6a21\u578b\u8d85\u8d8aGPT-4o 2.3%\u3002", "conclusion": "TTRV\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Recently,\nultrasound foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in\ncardiac ultrasound image analysis. However, obtaining high-quality ultrasound\nimages is a prerequisite for accurate diagnosis. Due to the exceptionally high\noperational difficulty of cardiac ultrasound, there is a shortage of highly\nskilled personnel, which hinders patients from receiving timely examination\nservices. In this paper, we aim to adapt the medical knowledge learned by\nfoundation models from vast datasets to the probe guidance task, which is\ndesigned to provide real-time operational recommendations for junior\nsonographers to acquire high-quality ultrasound images. Moreover, inspired by\nthe practice where experts optimize action decisions based on past\nexplorations, we meticulously design a parameter-efficient Vision-Action\nAdapter (VA-Adapter) to enable foundation model's image encoder to encode\nvision-action sequences, thereby enhancing guidance performance.

A major challenge lies in the non-stationary nature of quality\ndistributions in real-world scenarios, which limits the generalization ability\nof conventional methods. We introduce Continual AQA (CAQA), which equips AQA\nwith Continual Learning (CL) capabilities to handle evolving distributions\nwhile mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Although parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of pretrained models has shown promise in CL for image\nclassification, we find it insufficient for CAQA. Our empirical and theoretical\nanalyses reveal two insights: (i) Full-Parameter Fine-Tuning (FPFT) is\nnecessary for effective representation learning; yet (ii) uncontrolled FPFT\ninduces overfitting and feature manifold shift, thereby aggravating forgetting.\nTo address this, we propose Adaptive Manifold-Aligned Graph Regularization\n(MAGR++), which couples backbone fine-tuning that stabilizes shallow layers\nwhile adapting deeper ones with a two-step feature rectification pipeline: a\nmanifold projector to translate deviated historical features into the current\nrepresentation space, and a graph regularizer to align local and global\ndistributions.

However, current GEBD methods require\nprocessing complete video frames to make predictions, unlike humans processing\ndata online and in real-time. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new task,\nOnline Generic Event Boundary Detection (On-GEBD), aiming to detect boundaries\nof generic events immediately in streaming videos. This task faces unique\nchallenges of identifying subtle, taxonomy-free event changes in real-time,\nwithout the access to future frames. To tackle these challenges, we propose a\nnovel On-GEBD framework, Estimator, inspired by Event Segmentation Theory (EST)\nwhich explains how humans segment ongoing activity into events by leveraging\nthe discrepancies between predicted and actual information. Our framework\nconsists of two key components: the Consistent Event Anticipator (CEA), and the\nOnline Boundary Discriminator (OBD).

A bank failure can destroy the stability of the financial\nsystem, as banks are subject to systemic risk, affecting not only individual\nbanks but also segments or the entire financial system. Calculating the\nprobability of a bank going bankrupt is one way to ensure the banking system is\nsafe and sound. Existing literature and limitations: Statistical models, such\nas Altman's Z-Score, are one of the common techniques for developing a\nbankruptcy prediction model. However, statistical methods rely on rigid and\nsometimes irrelevant assumptions, which can result in low forecast accuracy.\nNew approaches are necessary. Objective of the research: Bankruptcy models are\ndeveloped using machine learning techniques, such as logistic regression (LR),\nrandom forest (RF), and support vector machines (SVM). According to several\nstudies, machine learning is also more accurate and effective than statistical\nmethods for categorising and forecasting banking risk management. Present\nResearch: The commercial bank data are derived from the annual financial\nstatements of 44 active banks and 21 bankrupt banks in Turkey from 1994 to\n2004, and the rural bank data are derived from the quarterly financial reports\nof 43 active and 43 bankrupt rural banks in Indonesia between 2013 and 2019.\nFive rural banks in Indonesia have also been selected to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of analysing bank bankruptcy trends. Findings and implications: The\nresults of the research experiments show that RF can forecast data from\ncommercial banks with a 90% accuracy rate. Furthermore, the three machine\nlearning methods proposed accurately predict the likelihood of rural bank\nbankruptcy.

Many real-world anomaly detection problems involve analyzing\nmultiple features over time, making time series analysis a natural approach for\nsuch problems. While deep learning models have achieved strong performance in\nthis field, their trend to exhibit high energy consumption limits their\ndeployment in resource-constrained environments such as IoT devices, edge\ncomputing platforms, and wearables. To address this challenge, this paper\nintroduces the \\textit{Vacuum Spiker algorithm}, a novel Spiking Neural\nNetwork-based method for anomaly detection in time series. It incorporates a\nnew detection criterion that relies on global changes in neural activity rather\nthan reconstruction or prediction error. It is trained using Spike\nTime-Dependent Plasticity in a novel way, intended to induce changes in neural\nactivity when anomalies occur. A new efficient encoding scheme is also\nproposed, which discretizes the input space into non-overlapping intervals,\nassigning each to a single neuron. This strategy encodes information with a\nsingle spike per time step, improving energy efficiency compared to\nconventional encoding methods.

One key challenge in\nlong video captioning is accurately recognizing the same individuals who appear\nin different frames, which we refer to as the ID-Matching problem. Few prior\nworks have focused on this important issue. Those that have, usually suffer\nfrom limited generalization and depend on point-wise matching, which limits\ntheir overall effectiveness. In this paper, unlike previous approaches, we\nbuild upon LVLMs to leverage their powerful priors. We aim to unlock the\ninherent ID-Matching capabilities within LVLMs themselves to enhance the\nID-Matching performance of captions. Specifically, we first introduce a new\nbenchmark for assessing the ID-Matching capabilities of video captions. Using\nthis benchmark, we investigate LVLMs containing GPT-4o, revealing key insights\nthat the performance of ID-Matching can be improved through two methods: 1)\nenhancing the usage of image information and 2) increasing the quantity of\ninformation of individual descriptions. Based on these insights, we propose a\nnovel video captioning method called Recognizing Identities for Captioning\nEffectively (RICE). Extensive experiments including assessments of caption\nquality and ID-Matching performance, demonstrate the superiority of our\napproach. Notably, when implemented on GPT-4o, our RICE improves the precision\nof ID-Matching from 50% to 90% and improves the recall of ID-Matching from 15%\nto 80% compared to baseline.

Despite its widespread adoption, there is still no comprehensive\nbenchmark to systematically evaluate their performance and utility, largely\nbecause of insufficient statistical validation and limited consideration of\nefficiency and generalization across diverse datasets. To bridge this gap, we\npresent U-Bench, the first large-scale, statistically rigorous benchmark that\nevaluates 100 U-Net variants across 28 datasets and 10 imaging modalities. Our\ncontributions are threefold: (1) Comprehensive Evaluation: U-Bench evaluates\nmodels along three key dimensions: statistical robustness, zero-shot\ngeneralization, and computational efficiency. We introduce a novel metric,\nU-Score, which jointly captures the performance-efficiency trade-off, offering\na deployment-oriented perspective on model progress. (2) Systematic Analysis\nand Model Selection Guidance: We summarize key findings from the large-scale\nevaluation and systematically analyze the impact of dataset characteristics and\narchitectural paradigms on model performance. Based on these insights, we\npropose a model advisor agent to guide researchers in selecting the most\nsuitable models for specific datasets and tasks. (3) Public Availability: We\nprovide all code, models, protocols, and weights, enabling the community to\nreproduce our results and extend the benchmark with future methods. In summary,\nU-Bench not only exposes gaps in previous evaluations but also establishes a\nfoundation for fair, reproducible, and practically relevant benchmarking in the\nnext decade of U-Net-based segmentation models.

Dropout offers a lightweight alternative by simulating\nensembles through random neuron deactivation; however, when applied to\npre-trained models, it tends to over-regularize and disrupt critical\nrepresentations necessary for generalization. In this work, we investigate\nMixout, a stochastic regularization technique that provides an alternative to\nDropout for domain generalization. Rather than deactivating neurons, Mixout\nmitigates overfitting by probabilistically swapping a subset of fine-tuned\nweights with their pre-trained counterparts during training, thereby\nmaintaining a balance between adaptation and retention of prior knowledge. Our\nstudy reveals that achieving strong performance with Mixout on domain\ngeneralization benchmarks requires a notably high masking probability of 0.9\nfor ViTs and 0.8 for ResNets. While this may seem like a simple adjustment, it\nyields two key advantages for domain generalization: (1) higher masking rates\nmore strongly penalize deviations from the pre-trained parameters, promoting\nbetter generalization to unseen domains; and (2) high-rate masking\nsubstantially reduces computational overhead, cutting gradient computation by\nup to 45% and gradient memory usage by up to 90%.

We then circumvent the problem\nof the gradient matching without real validation set by approximating it with\nthe gradient matching between each generated sample and its neighbors.\nExperimental evaluations on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art techniques in\nlow-bit quantization settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u8003\u8651\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9510\u5ea6\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u5347\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u8003\u8651\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u9510\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u636e\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u6765\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9510\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7528\u6837\u672c\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u548cImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651\u9510\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this paper, we focus on\nhuman-centric subdomain and present MV-Performer, an innovative framework for\ncreating synchronized novel view videos from monocular full-body captures. To\nachieve a 360-degree synthesis, we extensively leverage the MVHumanNet dataset\nand incorporate an informative condition signal.

We benchmarked DINOv3 against DINOv2 and ImageNet initialization across\nseven datasets (n>814,000). Two representative backbones were evaluated:\nViT-B/16 and ConvNeXt-B. Images were analyzed at 224x224, 512x512, and\n1024x1024 pixels. We additionally assessed frozen features from a 7B model. The\nprimary outcome was mean AUROC across labels. At 224x224, DINOv3 and DINOv2\nachieved comparable performance on adult datasets. Increasing resolution to\n512x512 yielded consistent improvements for DINOv3 over both DINOv2 and\nImageNet.

Diffusion models have\nrecently emerged as powerful generative models, capable of capturing complex\ndata distributions through iterative denoising.

However, such guarantees\nbreak down in non-stationary environments, where every fixed estimator may\nincur the surrogate loss growing linearly with $T$. We address this by proving\na bound of the form $F_T + C(1 + P_T)$ on the cumulative target loss, where\n$F_T$ is the cumulative surrogate loss of any comparator sequence, $P_T$ is its\npath length, and $C > 0$ is some constant. This bound depends on $T$ only\nthrough $F_T$ and $P_T$, often yielding much stronger guarantees in\nnon-stationary environments. Our core idea is to synthesize the dynamic regret\nbound of the online gradient descent (OGD) with the technique of exploiting the\nsurrogate gap.

In particular, an\nEfficientNet-B0 ranked first or second in terms of area under the ROC and\nprecision/recall curves in most evaluation settings, with RETFound only showing\npromising results in OEFI. FLAIR, on the other hand, demonstrated competitive\nzero-shot performance, achieving notable AUC-PR scores when prompted\nappropriately. These findings reveal that FM might not be a good tool for\nfine-grained ophthalmic tasks such as DME detection even after fine-tuning,\nsuggesting that lightweight CNNs remain strong baselines in data-scarce\nenvironments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FM\uff09\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u9ec4\u6591\u6c34\u80bf\uff08DME\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0FM\u5e76\u672a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u8ba8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bf9DME\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83RETFound\u3001FLAIR\u548cEfficientNet-B0\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "EfficientNet-B0\u5728\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cRETFound\u4ec5\u5728OEFI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0cFLAIR\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "FM\u5728DME\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u4ecd\u662f\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often lack robustness against various\ntransformations primarily including distortions, image regeneration, and\nadversarial perturbation, creating real-world challenges. In this work, we\nintroduce SpecGuard, a novel watermarking approach for robust and invisible\nimage watermarking. Unlike prior approaches, we embed the message inside hidden\nconvolution layers by converting from the spatial domain to the frequency\ndomain using spectral projection of a higher frequency band that is decomposed\nby wavelet projection. Spectral projection employs Fast Fourier Transform\napproximation to transform spatial data into the frequency domain efficiently.\nIn the encoding phase, a strength factor enhances resilience against diverse\nattacks, including adversarial, geometric, and regeneration-based distortions,\nensuring the preservation of copyrighted information. Meanwhile, the decoder\nleverages Parseval's theorem to effectively learn and extract the watermark\npattern, enabling accurate retrieval under challenging transformations. We\nevaluate the proposed SpecGuard based on the embedded watermark's invisibility,\ncapacity, and robustness.

This work demonstrates for the first time\nthat poisoning attacks instead require a near-constant number of documents\nregardless of dataset size. We conduct the largest pretraining poisoning\nexperiments to date, pretraining models from 600M to 13B parameters on\nchinchilla-optimal datasets (6B to 260B tokens).

Existing approaches to combat this\nrely on inference-time scaffolding or costly step-level supervision, neither of\nwhich scales easily. In this work, we introduce a scalable method to bootstrap\nlong-horizon reasoning capabilities using only existing, abundant short-horizon\ndata. Our approach synthetically composes simple problems into complex,\nmulti-step dependency chains of arbitrary length. We train models on this data\nusing outcome-only rewards under a curriculum that automatically increases in\ncomplexity, allowing RL training to be scaled much further without saturating.\nEmpirically, our method generalizes remarkably well: curriculum training on\ncomposed 6th-grade level math problems (GSM8K) boosts accuracy on longer,\ncompetition-level benchmarks (GSM-Symbolic, MATH-500, AIME) by up to 2.06x.\nImportantly, our long-horizon improvements are significantly higher than\nbaselines even at high pass@k, showing that models can learn new reasoning\npaths under RL. Theoretically, we show that curriculum RL with outcome rewards\nachieves an exponential improvement in sample complexity over full-horizon\ntraining, providing training signal comparable to dense supervision. h1\ntherefore introduces an efficient path towards scaling RL for long-horizon\nproblems using only existing data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u94fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u5347\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u652f\u67b6\u6216\u6602\u8d35\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5408\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u4f9d\u8d56\u94fe\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u8fdb\u884cRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728GSM8K\u7b49\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u957f\u7a0b\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe2.06\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55RL\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u7a0b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}
