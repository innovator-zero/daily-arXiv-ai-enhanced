Although early intervention and customized educational strategies\nare critical to improving outcomes, there is a pivotal gap in understanding and\naddressing nuanced behavioral patterns and emotional identification in autistic\nchildren prior to skill development. This extended research delves into the\nfoundational step of recognizing and mapping these patterns as a prerequisite\nto improving learning and soft skills. Using a longitudinal approach to monitor\nemotions and behaviors, this study aims to establish a baseline understanding\nof the unique needs and challenges faced by autistic students, particularly in\nthe Information Technology domain, where opportunities are markedly limited.\nThrough a detailed analysis of behavioral trends over time, we propose a\ntargeted framework for developing applications and technical aids designed to\nmeet these identified needs. Our research underscores the importance of a\nsequential and evidence-based intervention approach that prioritizes a deep\nunderstanding of each child's behavioral and emotional landscape as the basis\nfor effective skill development.

Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are\nwell-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby\nimproving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN\narchitecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific\ncomponents at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning.

To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware\ncooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture\nsearch, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative\nco-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a\ncoordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific\ngene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator\nreassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively\ncaptures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we\nintroduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce\nevaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution.

To\naddress these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of\nsystematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with\n45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V\nmodels. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background\nscene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene\nconsistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion\nsmoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner.

Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the\nnumber of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements\nacross images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive\niterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the\naccumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced\nResidual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the\npyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical\nsemantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the\nfinal deformation field, respectively.

It\nis known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale\ntraining of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding\nthe role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width\nasymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with\nthe mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram\nthat exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative\nmagnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we\nfind that the well-studied \"penalty\" effect of dropout only persists in the\nlimit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\\text{width})$. For\nlarger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is\nequivalent to a \"random geometry\" technique, where the gradients are thinned\nrandomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this\nasymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where\nthe neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks\n(depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not).

We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily\nconcerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the\nchallenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the\nenvironment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360\ndegrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune\na diffusion model to complete the lighting. Building on these advances, we\npropose ComGS, a novel 3D object-scene composition framework. Our method\nachieves high-quality, real-time rendering at around 28 FPS, produces visually\nharmonious results with vivid shadows, and requires only 36 seconds for\nediting.

As a\nresult, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators\nor simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed,\nand routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with\nboth reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external\nto the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language\nby internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the\nvocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but\nmay trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time.\nFrom there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive\nfeedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a\nresult. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new\nenvironments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with\ncounterfactual policy optimization.

RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends\nusing short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and\nghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains\nsufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in\ndenoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB\nimages, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise\ncharacteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge.

For example, one pixel in the first\nframe might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second\nframe. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are\nrobust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,\nthe event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame\nlarge motion by the event trajectories.

However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS\nusing both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between\nthese two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly\noptimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event\nmotion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields.

The\nshared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed\nby individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room\nlayout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework\nincorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving\nstrategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism. The proposed\nroom-geometry-based background depth resolving strategy leverages the room\nlayout and the depth decoder's output to generate the corresponding background\ndepth map. Then, a background-segmentation-guided fusion strategy derives\nfusion weights for the background and coarse depth maps from the segmentation\ndecoder's predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Stanford2D3D,\nMatterport3D and Structured3D datasets show that our proposed methods can\nachieve significantly superior performance than current open-source methods.\nOur code is available at https://github.com/emiyaning/RGCNet."}

Improved\nnowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead\nduring inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further\nintegrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the\nstrengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness\nand distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results\non three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and\n0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant\nmargin."}

First, we investigate five different SNR\nestimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order\nLinear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order\nLinear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression\n(NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown\nthat LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines\n(SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR.\nIn this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it\nstands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these\nresults lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression\nLinear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR\nmethod generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided\nWiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images. The proposed method is\nshown to achieve notable success in estimating SNR and NV of SEM images and\nleads to lower Mean Squared Error (MSE) after the filtering process."}

Across diverse VLA architectures and tasks in\nmanipulation and navigation, GLUESTICK achieves competitive memory efficiency\nwhile substantially recovering success rates and reducing safety violations.\nAdditional material can be found at: https://gluestick-vla.github.io/."}

Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating\nrigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth\nsensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion\nannotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating\nhands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based\nrewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from\nin-the-wild videos.\n  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the\nTACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.\nMeanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%\nin success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both\nreal and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and\ncostly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse\ndatasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation."}

In this paper, we propose a novel AI-based\napproach for automatic radiology report generation tailored to cranial trauma\ncases. Our model integrates an AC-BiFPN with a Transformer architecture to\ncapture and process complex medical imaging data such as CT and MRI scans. The\nAC-BiFPN extracts multi-scale features, enabling the detection of intricate\nanomalies like intracranial hemorrhages, while the Transformer generates\ncoherent, contextually relevant diagnostic reports by modeling long-range\ndependencies. We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial\nHemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models\nin both diagnostic accuracy and report generation. This solution not only\nsupports radiologists in high-pressure environments but also provides a\npowerful educational tool for trainee physicians, offering real-time feedback\nand enhancing their learning experience. Our findings demonstrate the potential\nof combining advanced feature extraction with transformer-based text generation\nto improve clinical decision-making in the diagnosis of traumatic brain\ninjuries."}

Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in\nrobotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop\nmore generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,\nrobotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic\ntasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically\nsuffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this\nproblem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies\nfrom automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot\ncapabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for\ndiverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to\nfinetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human\nsupervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's\nstate, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based\nmanipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly\nimprove zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.\nMoreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables\ndownscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on\nthe project page."}
