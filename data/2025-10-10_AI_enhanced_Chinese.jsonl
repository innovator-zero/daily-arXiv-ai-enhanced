This work has been submitted to the IEEE for\n  possible publication", "summary": "Co-exploitation attacks on software vulnerabilities pose severe risks to\nenterprises, a threat that can be mitigated by analyzing heterogeneous and\nmultimodal vulnerability data. Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are\nwell-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby\nimproving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN\narchitecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific\ncomponents at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic\nalgorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural\nsolution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook\nmodality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware\ncooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture\nsearch, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative\nco-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a\ncoordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific\ngene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator\nreassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively\ncaptures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we\nintroduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce\nevaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a\nsimilarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively\nbalance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and\navoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE)\ndataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours,\noutperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing\ncomputation cost by 27%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMACC-MGNAS\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u540c\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5171\u5229\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6f0f\u6d1e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u6001\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u540c\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff08MACC\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53cc\u8f68\u4ee3\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08MADTS\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u79cd\u7fa4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff08SPDI\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6VulCE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMACC-MGNAS\u4ee581.67%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u548c\u4ec53 GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd58.7%\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c1127%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "MACC-MGNAS\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u534f\u540c\u5171\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u641c\u7d22\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6f0f\u6d1e\u5171\u5229\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Under review. 26 pages, 11 figures, 11 tables. Access the\n  project page in https://nithincbabu7.github.io/DynamicEval", "summary": "Existing text-to-video (T2V) evaluation benchmarks, such as VBench and\nEvalCrafter, suffer from two limitations. (i) While the emphasis is on\nsubject-centric prompts or static camera scenes, camera motion essential for\nproducing cinematic shots and existing metrics under dynamic motion are largely\nunexplored. (ii) These benchmarks typically aggregate video-level scores into a\nsingle model-level score for ranking generative models. Such aggregation,\nhowever, overlook video-level evaluation, which is vital to selecting the\nbetter video among the candidate videos generated for a given prompt. To\naddress these gaps, we introduce DynamicEval, a benchmark consisting of\nsystematically curated prompts emphasizing dynamic camera motion, paired with\n45k human annotations on video pairs from 3k videos generated by ten T2V\nmodels. DynamicEval evaluates two key dimensions of video quality: background\nscene consistency and foreground object consistency. For background scene\nconsistency, we obtain the interpretable error maps based on the Vbench motion\nsmoothness metric. We observe that while the Vbench motion smoothness metric\nshows promising alignment with human judgments, it fails in two cases:\nocclusions/disocclusions arising from camera and foreground object movements.\nBuilding on this, we propose a new background consistency metric that leverages\nobject error maps to correct two failure cases in a principled manner. Our\nsecond innovation is the introduction of a foreground consistency metric that\ntracks points and their neighbors within each object instance to assess object\nfidelity.

When formulating dexterous manipulation tasks as a trajectory\noptimization problem, a common approach is to decompose these tasks into\nsub-tasks for each contact mode, which are each solved independently.\nOptimizing each sub-task independently can limit performance, as optimizing\ncontact points, contact forces, or other variables without information about\nfuture sub-tasks can place the system in a state from which it is challenging\nto make progress on subsequent sub-tasks. Further, optimizing these sub-tasks\nis very computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose\nAmortized Value Optimization (AVO), which introduces a learned value function\nthat predicts the total future task performance.

It also leads to substantial spatial\nmisalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses\nchallenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on\nsynthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT\ndenoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an\nImage Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT\nlung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates\nstructurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data\nfoundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a\nFrequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with\nthe IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of\ndenoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our\nIP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream\ndenoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined\nwith the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical\nstructure preservation.

In this work, we explore\nwhether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges\nof physical plausibility.

Due to the limited availability of\nhigh-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI\nclassification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in\nbalancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI\nclassification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial\ndata to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To\naddress this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion\nNetwork (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to\ncomplement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN\nleverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class\nlabel that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These\ndescriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text\nencoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in\nturn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification\nperformance.

However, the models may memorize private and/or\nsensitive information during training and regurgitate it in inference.\nRecently, machine unlearning has been leveraged to address the leakage of\nprivate data in LLMs. VLMs add a layer of complexity to this process, as the\nvisual context in the query may also contain sensitive information in addition\nto the text. To address this issue, we explore unlearning for vision-language\nmodels, specifically for the VQA task. We explore the role of visual tokens for\noutput generation in VLMs using cross-modal attention and utilize it to\nformulate Cross-Modal Attention Guided Unlearning (CAGUL), a lightweight and\nefficient VLM unlearning framework. In contrast to computationally expensive\nmodel finetuning methods, CAGUL utilizes external modules to encode unlearning\ninformation in visual tokens of low importance for relevant queries. We find\nthat the transformed visual tokens not only prevent leakage but also retain\nreference model behavior. Experimental results show that our method performs\nbetter or on par with finetuning-based baselines without altering the\npre-trained model parameters or incurring retraining costs, making it a\npractical and effective unlearning solution for VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6CAGUL\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u5757\u7f16\u7801\u4f4e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "CAGUL\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "CAGUL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684VLM\u9057\u5fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To study how these failures\naffect safety, researchers typically inject artificial faults into hardware or\nsoftware components and observe the outcomes. However, existing fault injection\nstudies often target a single sensor or machine perception (MP) module,\nresulting in siloed frameworks that are difficult to generalize or integrate\ninto unified simulation environments. This work addresses that limitation by\nreframing perception failures as hallucinations, false perceptions that distort\nan AV situational awareness and may trigger unsafe control actions. Since\nhallucinations describe only observable effects, this abstraction enables\nanalysis independent of specific sensors or algorithms, focusing instead on how\ntheir faults manifest along the MP pipeline. Building on this concept, we\npropose a configurable, component-agnostic hallucination injection framework\nthat induces six plausible hallucination types in an iterative open-source\nsimulator. More than 18,350 simulations were executed in which hallucinations\nwere injected while AVs crossed an unsignalized transverse street with traffic.\nThe results statistically validate the framework and quantify the impact of\neach hallucination type on collisions and near misses. Certain hallucinations,\nsuch as perceptual latency and drift, significantly increase the risk of\ncollision in the scenario tested, validating the proposed paradigm can stress\nthe AV system safety. The framework offers a scalable, statistically validated,\ncomponent agnostic, and fully interoperable toolset that simplifies and\naccelerates AV safety validations, even those with novel MP architectures and\ncomponents.

Genetic programming based techniques\nare the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently,\nneural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading\nneural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize\ntransformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on\nencoded input points.

Baked appearance and shadow\ninformation in GS radiance fields cause inconsistencies when combining objects\nand scenes. Addressing this requires relightable object reconstruction and\nscene lighting estimation. For relightable object reconstruction, existing\nGaussian-based inverse rendering methods often rely on ray tracing, leading to\nlow efficiency. We introduce Surface Octahedral Probes (SOPs), which store\nlighting and occlusion information and allow efficient 3D querying via\ninterpolation, avoiding expensive ray tracing. SOPs provide at least a 2x\nspeedup in reconstruction and enable real-time shadow computation in Gaussian\nscenes. For lighting estimation, existing Gaussian-based inverse rendering\nmethods struggle to model intricate light transport and often fail in complex\nscenes, while learning-based methods predict lighting from a single image and\nare viewpoint-sensitive. We observe that 3D object-scene composition primarily\nconcerns the object's appearance and nearby shadows. Thus, we simplify the\nchallenging task of full scene lighting estimation by focusing on the\nenvironment lighting at the object's placement. Specifically, we capture a 360\ndegrees reconstructed radiance field of the scene at the location and fine-tune\na diffusion model to complete the lighting.

Such conditions are commonly\nencountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure\nsettings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges,\nmaking it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details\nsimultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends\nusing short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and\nghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains\nsufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in\ndenoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB\nimages, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise\ncharacteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This\nraises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only\na single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single\nshort-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making\nit particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce\nUltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio\nmap to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to\nenhance detail recovery in dark regions.

This is because large inter-frame motions will increase\nthe uncertainty of the solution space. For example, one pixel in the first\nframe might have more choices to reach the corresponding pixel in the second\nframe. Event cameras can asynchronously capture rapid visual changes and are\nrobust to motion blur, but they do not provide color information. Intuitively,\nthe event stream can provide deterministic constraints for the inter-frame\nlarge motion by the event trajectories. Hence, combining\nlow-temporal-resolution images with high-framerate event streams can address\nthis challenge. However, it is challenging to jointly optimize Dynamic 3DGS\nusing both RGB and event modalities due to the significant discrepancy between\nthese two data modalities. This paper introduces a novel framework that jointly\noptimizes dynamic 3DGS from the two modalities. The key idea is to adopt event\nmotion priors to guide the optimization of the deformation fields. First, we\nextract the motion priors encoded in event streams by using the proposed LoCM\nunsupervised fine-tuning framework to adapt an event flow estimator to a\ncertain unseen scene. Then, we present the geometry-aware data association\nmethod to build the event-Gaussian motion correspondence, which is the primary\nfoundation of the pipeline, accompanied by two useful strategies, namely motion\ndecomposition and inter-frame pseudo-label.

The\napproach shows resilience to very large levels of noise and reduces the\ncomputation time of the IOC on this task by a factor of 15 when compared to a\nclassical bilevel implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u7ea7\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9006\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9006\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u7ea7\u91cd\u6784\u5c06\u53cc\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5355\u7ea7\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ed3\u679c\u7b49\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6781\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u53cc\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u5feb15\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7ea7\u91cd\u6784\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9006\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

To address the gaps, we introduce Geo-Temporal Reasoning\nbenchmark (GTR-Bench), a novel challenge for geographic temporal reasoning of\nmoving targets in a large-scale camera network. GTR-Bench is more challenging\nas it requires multiple perspective switches between maps and videos, joint\nreasoning across multiple videos with non-overlapping fields of view, and\ninference over spatial-temporal regions that are unobserved by any video\ncontext. Evaluations of more than 10 popular VLMs on GTR-Bench demonstrate that\neven the best proprietary model, Gemini-2.5-Pro (34.9%), significantly lags\nbehind human performance (78.61%) on geo-temporal reasoning. Moreover, our\ncomprehensive analysis on GTR-Bench reveals three primary deficiencies of\ncurrent models for geo-temporal reasoning.

Despite their significance in\npsychology, security, and behavioral analysis, micro-expression recognition\nremains challenging due to the difficulty of capturing subtle facial movements.\nOptical flow has been widely employed as an input modality for this task due to\nits effectiveness. However, most existing methods compute optical flow only\nbetween the onset and apex frames, thereby overlooking essential motion\ninformation in the apex-to-offset phase. To address this limitation, we first\nintroduce a comprehensive motion representation, termed Magnitude-Modulated\nCombined Optical Flow (MM-COF), which integrates motion dynamics from both\nmicro-expression phases into a unified descriptor suitable for direct use in\nrecognition networks. Building upon this principle, we then propose FMANet, a\nnovel end-to-end neural network architecture that internalizes the dual-phase\nanalysis and magnitude modulation into learnable modules.

However, existing methods\nfocus on pixel-level accuracy, causing oversmoothed room corners and noise\nsensitivity. In this paper, we propose a depth estimation framework based on\nroom geometry constraints, which extracts room geometry information through\nlayout prediction and integrates those information into the depth estimation\nprocess through background segmentation mechanism. At the model level, our\nframework comprises a shared feature encoder followed by task-specific decoders\nfor layout estimation, depth estimation, and background segmentation. The\nshared encoder extracts multi-scale features, which are subsequently processed\nby individual decoders to generate initial predictions: a depth map, a room\nlayout map, and a background segmentation map. Furthermore, our framework\nincorporates two strategies: a room geometry-based background depth resolving\nstrategy and a background-segmentation-guided fusion mechanism.

The complex, contact-rich dynamics of dexterous\nmanipulation create a \"reality gap\" that has limited prior work to constrained\nscenarios involving simple geometries, limited object sizes and aspect ratios,\nconstrained wrist poses, or customized hands. We address this sim-to-real\nchallenge with a novel framework that enables a single policy, trained in\nsimulation, to generalize to a wide variety of objects and conditions in the\nreal world. The core of our method is a joint-wise dynamics model that learns\nto bridge the reality gap by effectively fitting limited amount of real-world\ncollected data and then adapting the sim policy's actions accordingly. The\nmodel is highly data-efficient and generalizable across different whole-hand\ninteraction distributions by factorizing dynamics across joints, compressing\nsystem-wide influences into low-dimensional variables, and learning each\njoint's evolution from its own dynamic profile, implicitly capturing these net\neffects. We pair this with a fully autonomous data collection strategy that\ngathers diverse, real-world interaction data with minimal human intervention.\nOur complete pipeline demonstrates unprecedented generality: a single policy\nsuccessfully rotates challenging objects with complex shapes (e.g., animals),\nhigh aspect ratios (up to 5.33), and small sizes, all while handling diverse\nwrist orientations and rotation axes. Comprehensive real-world evaluations and\na teleoperation application for complex tasks validate the effectiveness and\nrobustness of our approach.

These artifacts, manifesting as\nflickering textures and jagged edges, arise from the mismatch between Gaussian\nprimitives and the multi-scale nature of urban geometry. While existing\n``divide-and-conquer'' pipelines address scalability, they fail to resolve this\nfidelity gap. In this paper, we propose PrismGS, a physically-grounded\nregularization framework that improves the intrinsic rendering behavior of 3D\nGaussians. PrismGS integrates two synergistic regularizers. The first is\npyramidal multi-scale supervision, which enforces consistency by supervising\nthe rendering against a pre-filtered image pyramid. This compels the model to\nlearn an inherently anti-aliased representation that remains coherent across\ndifferent viewing scales, directly mitigating flickering textures. This is\ncomplemented by an explicit size regularization that imposes a\nphysically-grounded lower bound on the dimensions of the 3D Gaussians.

Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in\nrobotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop\nmore generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,\nrobotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic\ntasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically\nsuffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this\nproblem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies\nfrom automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot\ncapabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for\ndiverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to\nfinetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human\nsupervision.

Extensive\nevaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art results in novel view synthesis and produces reconstructions\nwith superior geometric accuracy.

However, their\ngeneralization capability and reconstruction accuracy are still limited while\nreconstructing driving scenes, which results from two aspects: (1) The fixed\nview transformation fails when the camera configuration changes, limiting the\ngeneralization capability across different driving scenes equipped with\ndifferent camera configurations. (2) The small overlapping regions between\nsparse views of the $360^\\circ$ panorama and the complexity of driving scenes\nincrease the learning difficulty, reducing the reconstruction accuracy. To\nhandle these difficulties, we propose \\textbf{XYZCylinder}, a feedforward model\nbased on a unified cylinder lifting method which involves camera modeling and\nfeature lifting. Specifically, to improve the generalization capability, we\ndesign a Unified Cylinder Camera Modeling (UCCM) strategy, which avoids the\nlearning of viewpoint-dependent spatial correspondence and unifies different\ncamera configurations with adjustable parameters. To improve the reconstruction\naccuracy, we propose a hybrid representation with several dedicated modules\nbased on newly designed Cylinder Plane Feature Group (CPFG) to lift 2D image\nfeatures to 3D space. Experimental results show that XYZCylinder achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance under different evaluation settings, and can be\ngeneralized to other driving scenes in a zero-shot manner.

Our key insight is that\nreturn differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations\nproduce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely\ntask-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized\nthrough return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to\ndistinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group\nsimilar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their\nreturn differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive\ntriplets.

Extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both\nfidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in\ndistance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoGen\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210LBSN\u7b7e\u5230\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u5927\u89c4\u6a21LBSN\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "GeoGen\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u751f\u6210\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGeoGen\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoGen\u4e3aLBSN\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing\napproaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack\neffective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory\nincorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only\nenvironmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that\nencode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs\nimagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model\nimagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant\nenvironmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1)\na language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual\npurposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2)\nHybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral\npatterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an\nexperience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge\nthrough specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse\nmemory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios\ndemonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all\nscenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent\nbaseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory\nreduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental\nand behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis\nindicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this\nimagination-guided paradigm.

This imbalance creates a\nsignificant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations\ninstead of causal inference, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant\npredictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we\npropose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework.\nInstead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes the\nlearning task to predict the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial\nreference. The inertial reference serves as a counterfactual, forcing the model\nto move beyond simple pattern recognition and instead identify the underlying\ncausal factors (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) that necessitate deviations\nfrom a default, inertially-guided path. To deal with the optimization imbalance\ncaused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise\nNormalization of the predicted residual. It re-weights the optimization\nobjective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain\nwaypoints from dominating the learning signal.

Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and\ntasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including\nisolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized\nGFMs, and FedGFM techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "FedBook\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8054\u90a6\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08FedGFM\uff09\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57df\u5185\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u57df\u95f4\u6574\u5408\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08GFMs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u8bbf\u95ee\u591a\u57df\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5236\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002FedGFM\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\u3002", "method": "FedBook\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57df\u5185\u534f\u4f5c\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u4f18\u5316\u4f4e\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\uff09\u548c\u57df\u95f4\u6574\u5408\uff08\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57288\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cFedBook\u4f18\u4e8e21\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FedBook\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u805a\u5408\u672c\u5730\u4ee3\u7801\u672c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u56fe\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Intuitively speaking, the flatter the\nlandscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be.\nUnfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the\ngeneralization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap\nbetween the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure,\ni.e., \\textit{R\\'enyi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative R\\'enyi\nentropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss\nHessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform}\n(identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping\nthe sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the\n\\textit{R\\'enyi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of\nthe eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller\nthe (R\\'enyi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between\ngeneralization and (R\\'enyi) sharpness, we provide several generalization\nbounds in terms of R\\'enyi sharpness, by taking advantage of the\nreparametrization invariance property of R\\'enyi sharpness, as well as the\ntrick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation.\nFurthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong\ncorrelation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the R\\'enyi\nsharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of R\\'enyi\nSharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., R\\'enyi Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware\nminimization methods.

To overcome this, we propose\nLatent Harmony, a two-stage framework that redefines VAEs for UHD restoration\nby jointly regularizing the latent space and enforcing high-frequency-aware\nreconstruction.In Stage One, we introduce LH-VAE, which enhances semantic\nrobustness through visual semantic constraints and progressive degradation\nperturbations, while latent equivariance strengthens high-frequency\nreconstruction.Stage Two jointly trains this refined VAE with a restoration\nmodel using High-Frequency Low-Rank Adaptation (HF-LoRA): an encoder LoRA\nguided by a fidelity-oriented high-frequency alignment loss to recover\nauthentic details, and a decoder LoRA driven by a perception-oriented loss to\nsynthesize realistic textures.

While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR\nhave set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can\nbe a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical\ntrade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art\nSwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\non this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but\nimportant finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher\npeak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the\nlightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB.

Specifically, we propose a\nstatistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the\nratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly\ncapturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained\ndiffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients\napproximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion\ndecomposition while preserving physical constraints.

Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances\nbetween real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit\namplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments\nconfirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall\nand 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD.

SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to\n$k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity\ncomparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors,\nreducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| +\nd|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the\naccepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both\nstrongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression\npreserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where\napproximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$ factor in the effective\nthreshold parameter.

However, obtaining complete annotations for\nMLC is particularly challenging due to the complexity and high cost of the\nlabeling process. As a practical alternative, single-positive multi-label\nlearning (SPML) has emerged, where each image is annotated with only one\nrelevant label, and the model is expected to recover the full set of labels.\nWhile scalable, SPML introduces significant supervision ambiguity, demanding\nspecialized solutions for model training. Although various SPML methods have\nbeen proposed in the computer vision domain, research in the RS context remains\nlimited.

The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model\n(HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix,\nwhile simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory.

When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear\nmode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have\nreported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search\nbut also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for\nResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width\nensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance\nof finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that,\neven without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for\nachieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further\nexplain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs.\nSpecifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity\n(LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be\nrepresented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the\ncorresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's\noutput matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates\nLMC.

In this paper, we\nintroduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that\nrequires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g.,\nillustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU\npresents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization\ncapability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in\nthe feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains\nineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that\nexplicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures\ninstance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our\napproach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way\nfor practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code:\nhttps://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning/.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9886\u57df\u9057\u5fd8\uff08ADU\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7c7b\u522b\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u9886\u57df\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faADU\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u9886\u57df\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6355\u83b7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9886\u57df\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8eVLM\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "ADU\u4e3aVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9057\u5fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In this\nwork, we present UniVideo, a versatile framework that extends unified modeling\nto the video domain. UniVideo adopts a dual-stream design, combining a\nMultimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) for instruction understanding with a\nMultimodal DiT (MMDiT) for video generation. This design enables accurate\ninterpretation of complex multimodal instructions while preserving visual\nconsistency. Built on this architecture, UniVideo unifies diverse video\ngeneration and editing tasks under a single multimodal instruction paradigm and\nis jointly trained across them. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniVideo\nmatches or surpasses state-of-the-art task-specific baselines in\ntext/image-to-video generation, in-context video generation and in-context\nvideo editing. Notably, the unified design of UniVideo enables two forms of\ngeneralization.

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,\nbidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and\nscalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR\ngeneration by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from\nnon-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with\ntwo decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological\nfeatures, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging\nthese bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables\nthe AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,\nenriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training\nstrategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder\ngradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding\nnine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model\nsubstantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines.

Furthermore, we show that due\nto the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs\nunder interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a\nsimilar stochastic model from scratch.", "AI": {"tldr": "PSCBMs\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684CBM\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfCBMs\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165PSCBMs\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u5efa\u6a21\u6982\u5ff5\u95f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "PSCBMs\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "PSCBMs\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86CBMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We evaluate the performance of our model on the RSNA Intracranial\nHemorrhage Detection dataset, where it outperforms traditional CNN-based models\nin both diagnostic accuracy and report generation.

This flexible\nformulation naturally unifies many existing controllable video generation\ntasks--including first-frame image-to-video, inpainting, extension, and\ninterpolation--under a single, cohesive paradigm. Realizing this vision,\nhowever, faces a fundamental obstacle in modern latent video diffusion models:\nthe temporal ambiguity introduced by causal VAEs, where multiple pixel frames\nare compressed into a single latent representation, making precise frame-level\nconditioning structurally difficult. We address this challenge with\nVideoCanvas, a novel framework that adapts the In-Context Conditioning (ICC)\nparadigm to this fine-grained control task with zero new parameters. We propose\na hybrid conditioning strategy that decouples spatial and temporal control:\nspatial placement is handled via zero-padding, while temporal alignment is\nachieved through Temporal RoPE Interpolation, which assigns each condition a\ncontinuous fractional position within the latent sequence. This resolves the\nVAE's temporal ambiguity and enables pixel-frame-aware control on a frozen\nbackbone. To evaluate this new capability, we develop VideoCanvasBench, the\nfirst benchmark for arbitrary spatio-temporal video completion, covering both\nintra-scene fidelity and inter-scene creativity.

To achieve this, we adopt the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)\narchitecture as our video generative model, due to its proven capability to\ngenerate high-quality long videos. To ensure compatibility between DiT and our\nmulti-modal controls, we map all motion controls into a common sparse and\nuser-friendly point-based representation as the video/noise input. Further, to\nrespect the variety of controls which operate at varying levels of granularity\nand influence, we separate content controls and motion controls into two\nbranches to encode the required features before guiding the denoising process,\nresulting in two generators, one for motion and the other for content.

The manuscript is currently under review at Complex and\n  Intelligent Systems", "summary": "Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising\nfrom data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, the\nDivide2Conquer (D2C) method was previously proposed, which partitions training\ndata into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each.\nThis strategy enables learning more consistent patterns while minimizing the\ninfluence of individual outliers and noise. However, D2C's standard aggregation\ntypically treats all subset models equally or based on fixed heuristics (like\ndata size), potentially underutilizing information about their varying\ngeneralization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, we introduce\nDynamic Uncertainty-Aware Divide2Conquer (DUA-D2C), an advanced technique that\nrefines the aggregation process. DUA-D2C dynamically weights the contributions\nof subset models based on their performance on a shared validation set,\nconsidering both accuracy and prediction uncertainty. This intelligent\naggregation allows the central model to preferentially learn from subsets\nyielding more generalizable and confident edge models, thereby more effectively\ncombating overfitting. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets spanning\nmultiple domains demonstrate that DUA-D2C significantly improves\ngeneralization. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss\ncurves, and other performance metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of\nDUA-D2C. This study demonstrates that DUA-D2C improves generalization\nperformance even when applied on top of other regularization methods,\nestablishing it as a theoretically grounded and effective approach to combating\noverfitting in modern deep learning.

However, a principled understanding of why it works has been\nlacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its\ntraining process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels.\nCentral to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes\nthe direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the\nresponse space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the\nupdate direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size\nthreshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning\nconverges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts\nhow the critical step size must scale with response length and the success\nrate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization\nimprove stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success\nrate can stagnate strictly below $100\\%$.
