### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文比较了传统CNN和微调多模态LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务中的表现，发现LLM在少量数据下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态LLM在视觉任务中的潜力，尤其是在数据有限的情况下。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行全面比较。

Result: 微调LLM在少量数据（少于1000张图像）下性能提升36%，超越CNN。

Conclusion: LLM在低资源视觉任务中具有适应性和数据效率，为跨模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤分割中的类别不平衡和模型泛化能力不足问题。

Method: 使用U-Net模型，结合焦点损失函数和三种数据增强技术（水平翻转、旋转、缩放），在公开MRI数据集上进行实验。

Result: U-Net结合焦点损失达到90%的精确度，与现有最优结果相当。

Conclusion: 研究为脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计提供了透明、可复现的基线。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了文本到图像扩散模型中的记忆化问题，提出通过调整初始噪声样本来减少记忆化并保持图像与文本的对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成图像时容易记忆训练数据，引发隐私和版权问题。研究发现记忆化与初始噪声样本有关，因此需要找到方法减少记忆化。

Method: 提出两种策略：集体或个体调整初始噪声样本，以促进更早的逃离记忆化区域。

Result: 这些策略显著减少了记忆化，同时保持了图像与文本的对齐。

Conclusion: 调整初始噪声样本是减少扩散模型记忆化的有效方法。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了AI生成图像中的性别偏见问题，比较了DALL-E 3和Ideogram在职业场景中的表现，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像工具广泛使用，但存在性别偏见问题，影响多样性和公平性。

Method: 通过生成750多张职业相关AI图像，并进行主题分析。

Result: DALL-E 3和Ideogram均强化了传统性别刻板印象，但程度不同。

Conclusion: 需采取措施减少AI图像中的性别偏见，促进多样性。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VAR模型通过动态Mixture-of-Experts路由减少计算冗余，提升效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAR模型因重复Transformer调用导致的计算冗余问题。

Method: 集成动态Mixture-of-Experts路由，采用尺度感知阈值策略。

Result: 减少20% FLOPs，加速11%推理，保持图像质量。

Conclusion: 新架构在计算效率和图像质量间取得平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法混淆了模型和数据不确定性，导致误分类。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模GMM参数，从深度网络特征空间中提取认知不确定性。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95降低36%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外数据或训练阶段，显著优于现有基于不确定性的方法。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hi-OSCAR是一种层次化开放集分类器，用于活动识别，能够以最先进的精度识别已知活动，同时拒绝未知活动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决活动识别中未见过活动的处理问题，以及活动类别间的不平等差异。

Method: 将活动类别组织成层次结构，提出Hi-OSCAR分类器。

Result: Hi-OSCAR能够识别已知活动并拒绝未知活动，同时提供更细粒度的分类信息。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR和NFI_FARED数据集为开放集活动识别研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无监督聚类方法，用于自动检测高频振荡（HFOs），在癫痫患者中验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HFOs是识别癫痫区域的新生物标志物，但手动检测耗时且主观，需自动化方法。

Method: 使用S变换提取时频域事件，通过无监督聚类区分HFOs、尖峰、背景活动和伪迹。

Result: 在控制数据集中灵敏度97.67%，精度98.57%；癫痫患者中HFOs与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: HFOs是癫痫的有效生物标志物，切除HFOs（尤其是快速波纹）可减少癫痫发作。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv2的研究通过SAEs构建了一个32,000单元的字典，揭示了其功能特化和表示几何，提出了Minkowski表示假设（MRH）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DINOv2模型感知的本质，理解其在不同任务中的功能特化和表示结构。

Method: 采用线性表示假设（LRH）和稀疏自编码器（SAEs）构建字典，分析任务特化和表示几何。

Result: 发现表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，字典趋向更一致性，提出基于凸混合原型的MRH假设。

Conclusion: DINOv2的表示结构超越了线性稀疏性，MRH为理解视觉Transformer表示提供了新视角。

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhyDAE提出了一种物理引导的退化自适应专家方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，有效处理多种异构退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，导致修复效果受限。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，结合RMP和FADD分析退化特征，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，显著提升修复质量并降低计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能与效率之间实现了最佳平衡，代码已开源。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

Motivation: 解决临床决策中多模态数据整合的挑战，以及现有视觉语言模型在医学领域的不透明性和数据稀缺问题。

Method: 基于统一的基于补丁的视觉编码器和LLM解码器，逐步训练1670万个样本，支持从2D到3D和视频的理解。

Result: 在30个基准测试中表现最优，超越开源模型并与专有系统竞争。

Conclusion: Hulu-Med通过开源完整流程，证明了高性能医学VLM的透明实现，为临床AI提供了基础工具。

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个核心，但通常被孤立研究。Puffin旨在统一这两者，扩展相机维度的空间感知能力。

Method: Puffin通过将相机视为语言，结合语言回归和扩散生成技术，训练于Puffin-4M数据集（400万视觉-语言-相机三元组），并整合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射。

Result: 实验表明，Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务中优于专用模型，并能通过指令调优泛化到多样化的跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin为多模态空间智能研究提供了统一的框架，未来将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准以推动该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

*Nicolas Ewen,Jairo Diaz-Rodriguez,Kelly Ramsay*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结构化输出正则化（SOR）框架，用于改进传统迁移学习的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统迁移学习方法冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，且在小数据下容易过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构（如卷积滤波器），并结合组套索和L1惩罚，以最小参数适应特定数据。

Result: 在三个少样本医学影像分类任务中，使用DenseNet121和EfficientNetB4取得了竞争性结果。

Conclusion: SOR是一种简单有效的框架，适用于广泛的迁移学习任务。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

TL;DR: BEAR是一个全面的基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在具体能力上的表现，并提出了BEAR-Agent以提升其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要集中在特定领域，缺乏对MLLMs具体能力的系统评估。

Method: BEAR包含4,469个跨14个领域的任务，涵盖从低级指向到高级规划的多种能力。BEAR-Agent通过整合预训练视觉模型增强MLLMs的感知和规划能力。

Result: BEAR-Agent显著提升了MLLMs的性能，绝对增益9.12%，相对提升17.5%。

Conclusion: 提升MLLMs的具体能力有助于其在模拟环境中的任务表现。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出一种基于生物启发的防御框架，通过注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码来对抗对抗攻击，无需重新训练分类器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法计算成本高，而人类视觉系统通过生物机制天然对抗对抗扰动，启发研究生物机制在防御中的应用。

Method: 结合三种生物机制（中央-外周处理、眼跳运动和皮层填充），使用强化学习引导眼跳选择性捕获多个中央-外周瞥视，整合为重建图像后分类。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上验证，该方法提高了系统鲁棒性，减少训练开销，适用于多种分类器和攻击类型。

Conclusion: 生物启发的预处理方法有效缓解对抗噪声，保持语义完整性，且无需调整现有分类器，易于集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse

Abstract: This paper presents a real-time spill detection system that utilizes
pretrained deep learning models with RGB and thermal imaging to classify spill
vs. no-spill scenarios across varied environments. Using a balanced binary
dataset (4,000 images), our experiments demonstrate the advantages of thermal
imaging in inference speed, accuracy, and model size. We achieve up to 100%
accuracy using lightweight models like VGG19 and NasNetMobile, with thermal
models performing faster and more robustly across different lighting
conditions. Our system runs on consumer-grade hardware (RTX 4080) and achieves
inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

TL;DR: LinearSR框架首次系统性解决了线性注意力在图像超分辨率中的关键问题，包括训练不稳定性和感知-失真权衡，实现了高效且高质量的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决线性注意力在图像超分辨率中因计算复杂度和训练不稳定性导致的性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出ESGF策略解决训练不稳定性，SNR-based MoE架构缓解感知-失真权衡，以及轻量级TAG指导范式。

Result: LinearSR在保持高效的同时，实现了SOTA的感知质量和推理速度。

Conclusion: 为高效生成超分辨率领域提供了首个稳健的线性注意力方法，奠定未来研究基础。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且侵入性强，需要更高效、非侵入的替代方案。

Method: 结合YOLO、Grounding DINO目标检测，光流模糊检测，DINOv2图像编码及聚类方法，从视频中提取高质量关键帧。

Result: 关键帧选择方法在kākā重新识别中达到高准确率，优于传统标记方法。

Conclusion: 该AI驱动方法为野生动物监测提供了非侵入、高效的解决方案，适用于生态学和保护生物学领域。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个多层级模型路由系统，通过动态选择专家模型提升视频质量评估（VQA）的泛化能力和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA模型在泛化性、可解释性和扩展性方面存在不足，无法适应多样化的视频内容和任务。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，利用视觉-语言模型（VLMs）动态路由和集成专家模型，结合计算预算设计多层级路由系统。

Result: Q-Router在多个基准测试中表现优异，显著提升泛化性和可解释性，并在质量问答任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: Q-Router为下一代VQA系统提供了灵活、鲁棒的基础，并展示了在视频生成后处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

Method: 提出多级模态对齐、硬负样本挖掘和门控交叉注意力模块。

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019数据集上超越现有最佳方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了Med-VQA中的关键挑战，提升了性能。

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

TL;DR: SkipSR通过跳过低细节区域的计算，显著加速视频超分辨率处理，同时保持感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法对所有像素统一处理，效率低且成本高，而许多区域无需精细处理。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入识别低细节区域并跳过计算，仅处理需要精细化的区域。

Result: 在720p视频上，方法比现有模型快60%，且无感知质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR是一种简单有效的视频超分辨率加速方法，适用于标准和一阶扩散模型。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

TL;DR: D-CoDe是一个无需训练的适配框架，通过动态压缩和问题分解解决视频大语言模型中的感知瓶颈和令牌过载问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型扩展到视频领域时，面临处理密集和长时间视觉输入的挑战。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择关键帧和空间令牌聚合）和问题分解（将查询拆分为子问题）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著提升视频理解能力，尤其在长视频任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: D-CoDe能有效处理复杂视频-语言任务，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像进行分类，但会引入遮挡噪声且计算成本高。

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量2D嵌入，并通过标签引导蒸馏到3D学生模型中。

Result: 在ScanNet200数据集上AP50达35.7，推理速度提升6.0x至152.2x。

Conclusion: FOLK方法显著提升了开放词汇3D实例分割的性能和效率。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Motivation: 蔓越莓种植中的变化监测通常需要人工完成，耗时且效率低。深度学习虽有望解决这一问题，但存在高维特征难以解释和需要大量标注数据的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法通用性强，可扩展至其他作物和应用，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念的层次性和组合性，双曲空间虽能有效捕捉层次性，但对组合性的适用性尚不明确。

Method: PHyCLIP采用双曲空间的乘积度量（$\ell_1$-Product），在双曲因子内捕捉层次性，通过乘积度量捕捉组合性。

Result: 实验表明，PHyCLIP在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上优于现有单空间方法，且嵌入空间更具可解释性。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积度量成功解决了层次性和组合性的表示难题，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

TL;DR: SegTrans是一种新的对抗攻击框架，通过分割输入样本并重新映射语义信息，显著提高了对抗样本在不同分割模型间的可转移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法在分割模型间的转移成功率低，主要由于复杂的上下文依赖和特征分布差异。

Method: SegTrans将输入样本分割为多个局部区域，重新映射语义信息生成增强样本，用于优化扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，SegTrans平均提高了8.55%的转移攻击成功率，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans通过局部语义信息优化扰动，显著提升了对抗攻击的转移性和效率。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击威胁深度学习模型的知识产权，现有防御方法难以直接应用于图像修复任务。

Method: 提出ASVP方法，利用奇异值分解对教师模型的内部特征图进行结构化高频扰动。

Result: 在五种图像修复任务中，ASVP显著降低学生模型的性能（PSNR下降4 dB，SSIM下降60-75%），且对教师模型影响极小。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像修复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The

TL;DR: Hamba是一种新颖的图引导Mamba框架，用于从单张RGB图像重建3D手部，通过图引导双向扫描和高效令牌使用显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的Transformer方法在3D手部重建中未能完全实现鲁棒和准确的性能，主要由于关节间空间关系建模效率低。

Method: 提出图引导状态空间（GSS）块，结合图学习和状态空间建模，使用更少的令牌（比注意力方法少88.5%）高效学习关节空间关系。

Result: 在多个基准测试和实际场景中，Hamba显著优于现有方法，FreiHAND数据集上PA-MPVPE为5.3mm，F@15mm为0.992，并在两个竞赛排行榜中排名第一。

Conclusion: Hamba通过图引导状态空间特征和全局-局部特征融合，实现了高效且准确的3D手部重建，成为当前最优方法。

Abstract: 3D Hand reconstruction from a single RGB image is challenging due to the
articulated motion, self-occlusion, and interaction with objects. Existing SOTA
methods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and
shape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily
due to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this
problem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which
bridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to
reformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D
reconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently
learn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction
performance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block
that learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and
uses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we
integrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion
module. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively
leverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global
and local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks
and in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing
SOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the
time of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的感知时间缩放（PTS）范式，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉感知任务中的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLMs在视觉感知任务中表现有限，推断时间缩放效果不佳，作者认为这是由于模型将视觉理解视为一次性输出，缺乏对感知过程的建模。

Method: 提出PTS范式，通过分解复杂感知问题为中间子问题，并结合强化学习技术，提升感知精度。

Result: PTS将高精度性能从8.0%提升至64.7%，并在域外任务中表现良好。

Conclusion: PTS通过增加感知相关token和模型对图像token的关注，显著改善了感知能力，且与数学推理数据结合时效果更佳。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

TL;DR: mmJoints框架通过增强预训练毫米波姿态估计器的输出，显式估计关节感知可能性和位置可靠性，提升下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决毫米波姿态估计中因稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型过度依赖统计先验的问题。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，通过估计关节感知可能性和位置可靠性来增强姿态估计器的输出。

Result: 在13种姿态估计场景中，mmJoints的误差率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升12.5%，活动识别性能提升16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式估计偏差，显著提升了姿态估计的准确性和下游任务性能。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法在多模态大语言模型中存在检索精度低和效率不足的问题，尤其是对查询与图像对象的对齐和冗余细粒度图像段处理不足。

Method: 提出HiMIR框架，采用分层范式增强查询与图像对象的对齐，利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余计算，并自动配置数据集参数。

Result: 实验表明，HiMIR在提升检索精度的同时，计算量减少了3.5倍。

Conclusion: HiMIR通过高效的分层调度和自动化配置，显著提升了多模态检索的准确性和效率。

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DGLSS-NL的新任务，旨在解决LiDAR语义分割中标签噪声和领域泛化问题，并提出了DuNe框架，通过双分支设计提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注常因传感器缺陷、遮挡和人为错误而存在噪声，影响分割精度，尤其在领域变化时更严重。现有方法在3D LiDAR数据上表现不佳，亟需新解决方案。

Method: 提出DuNe框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性和基于置信度的交叉熵损失过滤预测。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，如SemanticKITTI上56.86% mIoU，nuScenes上42.28%，整体AM为49.57%，HM为48.50%。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中展示了强大的领域泛化能力，为LiDAR语义分割中的噪声标签问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is
available on our project page.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本生成图像模型在复杂局部区域（如手部）生成细节不准确，但手部质量评估被忽视，限制了下游任务性能。

Method: 构建HandPair数据集（48k高低质量手部图像对），开发基于多模态大语言模型和手部关键点先验知识的HandEval模型。

Result: HandEval在人类标注测试集上优于现有方法，且在下游应用中显著提升手部真实性和检测准确性。

Conclusion: HandEval是首个手部质量评估模型，具有广泛的下游应用潜力。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够有效解决植入过程中的敏感性与容忍度平衡问题，提升监控可靠性。

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Motivation: AI着色技术可能被滥用，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行着色并转售，但目前缺乏有效的防御手段。

Method: 提出了Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma)方法，通过优化不可察觉的扰动和拉普拉斯滤波器保护感知质量，并增强跨模型迁移性和鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低着色质量，同时保持视觉外观。

Conclusion: 这是首次提出保护视觉内容免受非法AI着色的防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护奠定了基础。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

Conclusion: SJD2框架有效加速自回归模型的图像生成，且不牺牲生成质量。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Conclusion: 提出了初步解决方案，并公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 物体幻觉是LVLM中的关键挑战，即生成输入图像中不存在的物体描述。研究发现视觉令牌的高认知不确定性是导致幻觉的关键因素。

Method: 提出了一种策略：通过对抗扰动识别不确定视觉令牌，并在VE的中间层自注意力过程中屏蔽这些令牌，以减少其对视觉编码的影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了LVLM中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有技术协同工作。

Conclusion: 通过修改VE可以有效减少物体幻觉，提升LVLM的性能。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Conclusion: 该方法在提升自回归图像生成质量和采样速度方面具有普适性和高效性。

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GL-DT的框架，结合STFF模块和全局-局部检测策略，提升无人机多目标跟踪的准确性和连续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机在军事侦察等领域的广泛应用需要高效的多目标跟踪技术，但复杂背景和小目标等问题仍挑战现有方法。

Method: 采用时空特征融合模块和全局-局部协作检测策略，结合JPTrack算法减少ID切换和轨迹断裂。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提升了跟踪的连续性和稳定性，同时保持实时性能。

Conclusion: GL-DT框架为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

*Youwei Zheng,Yuxi Ren,Xin Xia,Xuefeng Xiao,Xiaohua Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Dense2MoE通过将密集DiT转换为MoE结构，减少激活参数60%，保持性能并超越剪枝方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DiT参数大导致的推理开销问题，避免剪枝带来的性能下降。

Method: 用MoE层替换FFNs，提出MoB选择性激活块，设计多步蒸馏流程优化转换。

Result: 激活参数减少62.5%，整体减少60%，性能保持原水平。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成提供了新范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 医学影像的智能分析对临床诊断至关重要，尤其是识别细微病理特征。

Method: 采用多分支ConvNeXt架构，结合全局平均池化、全局最大池化和新的注意力加权池化机制，并通过端到端流程和两阶段训练策略。

Conclusion: 现代多分支架构结合精细数据处理，可超越现有最优模型，证明深度学习在医学诊断中的高效性。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

*Weikai Huang,Jieyu Zhang,Taoyang Jia,Chenhao Zheng,Ziqi Gao,Jae Sung Park,Ranjay Krishna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SOS是一个基于对象中心合成策略的简单可扩展数据合成管道，通过高质量合成对象片段和生成式重光照技术生成多样化的标注数据，在检测和视觉定位任务中表现优于大型真实数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模标注数据集成本高、覆盖偏差大且难以扩展，合成数据缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: SOS采用对象中心合成策略，结合结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: 在检测和视觉定位任务中，SOS生成的10万张合成图像优于GRIT（20M）和V3Det（200K）等大型真实数据集，例如在LVIS检测中提升10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO视觉定位中提升8.4 NAcc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，提升低数据和封闭词汇场景下的泛化能力，并为挑战性视觉定位任务提供针对性数据生成。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态语义扩散模型（MSDM），用于生成逼真的细胞和核分割图像-掩码对，解决了标注数据稀缺的问题，并通过合成数据显著提升了分割模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算病理学中细胞和核分割面临标注数据稀缺的挑战，尤其是罕见或非典型形态的数据。手动标注成本高且耗时，合成数据成为一种经济高效的替代方案。

Method: 通过多模态语义扩散模型（MSDM），结合细胞/核形态（水平和垂直映射）、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的检测/指示元数据，生成具有所需形态特性的图像-掩码对。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，Wasserstein距离低，且合成样本显著提升了分割模型在特定细胞类型（如柱状细胞）上的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

*Satya P. Singh,Rashmi Chaudhry,Anand Srivastava,Jagath C. Rajapakse*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT是一种可分离的正交变换，通过极坐标下的张量积构造，显著降低了计算复杂度和内存需求，同时保持了数值稳定性和重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交矩方法（如Zernike和伪Zernike矩）在计算复杂度和数值稳定性方面存在不足，尤其是在高阶情况下。

Method: PSepT通过离散余弦变换（DCT）径向基和傅里叶谐波角基的张量积构造，实现了极坐标下的完全可分离性。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度降至O(N² log N)，内存需求降至O(N²)，条件数降至O(√N)，并在实验中表现出更好的数值稳定性和分类性能。

Conclusion: PSepT为高阶矩分析提供了新的可能性，适用于鲁棒的图像分析应用。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络通常被视为不透明的系统，需要解释性方法来提高信任和问责。现有方法通常将测试预测归因于输入特征或训练样本，但作者认为应同时研究这两种视角。

Method: 论文提出了“训练特征归因”方法，将测试预测与训练图像中的特定区域关联起来。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能提供细粒度的解释，识别导致错误分类的有害样本，并揭示传统方法无法发现的虚假相关性。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因为深度模型的内部机制提供了新的见解，有助于提高模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图像的支气管镜拓扑定位方法，无需患者CT扫描，仅使用幻影数据训练，具有良好泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 支气管镜导航在复杂支气管结构中具有挑战性，现有方法依赖CT扫描和额外设备，成本高且复杂。

Method: 通过图像处理技术实现拓扑定位，仅需幻影数据训练，无需真实患者数据标注。

Result: 方法在真实数据测试序列中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法为支气管镜导航提供了低成本、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Motivation: 实例级识别（ILR）需要细粒度标注，但大规模标注数据集难以获取，限制了其实际应用。

Method: 通过合成方法生成多领域、多条件下的对象实例，构建大规模训练集，并微调基础视觉模型。

Result: 在七个ILR基准测试中显著提升了检索性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为ILR提供了一种高效、有效的数据生成替代方案，仅需目标领域名称即可实现广泛应用。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代物体检测器局限于“封闭世界”假设，无法处理现实场景中的新物体。现有的开放集检测方法仅将未知物体标记为“未知”，缺乏实用性。

Method: TARO采用基于sparsemax的头部建模物体性，层次引导的重新标记组件提供辅助监督，以及学习层次关系的分类模块。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别的混淆，并在未知召回率和已知mAP上表现优异。

Conclusion: TARO通过层次化分类提升了未知物体的实用性，适用于安全关键场景。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

Result: oVDA在精度和VRAM使用上优于其他在线方法，在A100上达42 FPS，Jetson上达20 FPS。

Conclusion: oVDA高效且适合边缘设备，代码将开源以便部署。

Abstract: Depth estimation from monocular video has become a key component of many
real-world computer vision systems. Recently, Video Depth Anything (VDA) has
demonstrated strong performance on long video sequences. However, it relies on
batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging

systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based

EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中潜力显著。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

Result: 在合成数据和真实数据上均显著优于现有方法，并贡献了新的数据集。

Conclusion: TRT架构在光子效率成像中表现出色，为LOS和NLOS成像提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

TL;DR: SVI（Stable Video Infinity）通过Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning技术生成无限长度视频，解决了现有方法在长视频生成中的误差累积和场景单一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法因误差累积和单提示外推限制，导致场景重复且运动单一。SVI旨在通过训练与测试假设的差异，提出新方法解决这一问题。

Method: SVI采用Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning，通过闭环回收DiT的自生成误差作为监督提示，动态学习和纠正误差。具体包括误差注入、双向积分近似预测和误差动态存储。

Result: SVI在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和先进性能，能够从秒级视频扩展到无限时长，且兼容多种条件（如音频、骨骼和文本流）。

Conclusion: SVI通过创新的误差回收微调技术，实现了高质量、无限长度的视频生成，解决了现有方法的局限性，展现了其先进性和多功能性。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

TL;DR: TEMA-LLM是一个结合大语言模型（LLMs）的跨域序列推荐框架，通过语义标签生成和多注意力机制提升推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决跨域序列推荐中如何准确捕捉用户在不同服务中的行为模式的问题。

Method: 利用LLMs生成语义标签，结合多注意力机制建模用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: LLMs在提升智能、用户为中心的推荐系统中具有潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and

further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable
reference for advancing weather-resilient vision systems in smart

Result: HMVDx的诊断准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该框架为MLLMs在医疗视频理解中的应用提供了重要技术贡献，展示了低成本MLLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前研究倾向于使用通用视觉语言模型（VLMs）进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略专用模型的性能上限。

Method: 建立零样本基准测试，评估前三开源VLMs，并与专用视觉和多模态方法对比性能、效率和鲁棒性。

Result: VLMs在隐私预测准确性上落后于专用模型，但在图像扰动下表现更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 尽管VLMs资源消耗大且推理速度慢，但其鲁棒性优势值得进一步研究。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Motivation: 解决黑盒视觉语言模型在放射影像视觉问答中因幻觉导致的准确性下降问题。

Method: 通过计算DSE量化语义不一致性，过滤高熵问题，并评估模型在剩余问题上的准确性。

Conclusion: DSE是一种有效的幻觉检测方法，可显著提升临床VLM应用的诊断准确性。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Result: 框架自然整合关键时刻定位能力，提升分割和跟踪性能。

Conclusion: 方法避免了外部时间戳编码，通过联合优化和动态更新实现了高效且稳定的视频对象分割。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Conclusion: 研究不仅为多模态RLVR提供了新的token级感知视角，还提出了一种有效的优化策略，显著提升了LVLMs的多模态推理能力。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

Motivation: 探索人类视觉注视的时空统计特性，以改进注意力建模和视觉界面设计。

Method: 通过大规模实验记录40名参与者观看50张图片的400万次注视点，并训练CNN预测注视热点图。

Result: 发现人类注视轨迹符合Levy行走模式，CNN能准确预测注视热点。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似自然觅食的统计规律，为生成和预测模型提供了新方向。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Motivation: 几何推理是多模态大语言模型的核心挑战，现有模型在几何问题上的表现远低于文本推理能力，表明瓶颈在于对几何图形的理解。

Method: 提出CapGeo框架，通过将视觉内容转换为文本描述（caption）来桥接视觉与文本模态，并引入CapGeo-Bench数据集和关键点评估指标。

Conclusion: CapGeo框架和CapGeo-Bench为提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力提供了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for

which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G

Conclusion: Hybrid-depth通过语言指导整合语义和空间信息，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知和先验知识利用，有效提升了半监督细胞核实例分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以处理热红外图像中的耦合退化问题，且通用增强方法因成像模型差异效果有限。

Method: 基于热成像过程建立提示对，通过融合提示对调制模型特征，结合SPT机制逐步优化复合退化处理。

Result: 在特定和复杂退化场景下均表现优异，性能提升8.76%。

Conclusion: PPFN和SPT机制有效提升了热红外图像增强效果，尤其在复合退化场景中表现突出。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Result: 实验证明所提方法在多个数据集上有效。

Conclusion: 动态CoT策略显著提升了VLM在多模态关键词预测任务中的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个专注于视觉推理的基准测试，旨在填补现有语言推理基准的不足，通过挑战性感知任务评估模型从视觉内容中推理的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估语言推理，视觉输入常被视为可替换的背景。BLINK-Twice旨在推动从语言推理转向基于图像的推理。

Method: BLINK-Twice包含七类视觉挑战、自然对抗图像对和标注的推理链，用于细粒度评估推理过程。评估了20个领先的MLLM模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成显著挑战，现有语言推理策略（如思维链）效果不稳定。重复图像观察和主动视觉交互能提升性能。

Conclusion: BLINK-Twice揭示了视觉推理的新需求，强调需要新的视觉推理范式。数据集已公开。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

TL;DR: VAD-GS是一种针对城市场景的3D高斯泼溅框架，通过体素可见性推理和多样性视图选择恢复缺失结构，显著提升几何重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法依赖初始点云质量，在无边界动态城市环境中表现不佳，导致失真和伪影。

Method: 通过体素可见性推理识别不可靠结构，多样性视图选择支持信息视图，基于多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上表现优于现有3DGS方法，显著提升静态和动态对象的几何重建质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过几何先验指导生成新高斯基元，有效解决初始点云不完整问题，适用于复杂城市场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 森林生物量准确量化对碳循环监测至关重要，但现有方法难以建模长程依赖关系以区分树木。

Result: 在丹麦国家森林调查数据上表现优异，无需数字地形模型（DTM）且对边界伪影鲁棒。

Conclusion: 为大规模森林生物量分析提供了高效工具，推动了基于LiDAR的森林调查。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于Transformer的模型在视觉任务（如目标检测）中推理效率低下的问题，尤其是DETR中MLP层的稀疏性未被充分利用。

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：轻量级门控机制，通过小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Result: MGS在COCO数据集上实现85-95%的激活稀疏性，保持或提升性能的同时显著减少计算量。

Conclusion: MGS提供了一种实用的、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，无需重新训练即可高效部署预训练的视觉Transformer。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor通过语言嵌入表示和精确定位策略，成功解决了4D场景编辑中的语义精确性和局部化问题，为动态场景编辑提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Motivation: 现有学习方法在真实低光场景中难以有效利用时间信息，导致噪声处理不佳。

Method: 第一阶段使用Visual State-Space块进行多帧对齐，恢复亮度、颜色和结构；第二阶段引入动态权重时间聚合的循环细化模块，并通过纹理自适应损失保留细节。

Result: 实验表明，DWTA-Net在真实低光视频中能有效抑制噪声和伪影，视觉质量优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DWTA-Net通过联合时间线索和动态权重聚合，显著提升了低光视频增强的性能。

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Conclusion: 标准化评估框架和临床基础方法有助于更准确地评估交互式分割算法的真实性能。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy

for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上表现优于现有方法，实现了更高的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优化浅层特征利用，显著提升了小物体检测的性能和实时性。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

Conclusion: FLOWING为变形任务提供了一种稳定且高效的新方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

Result: 实验表明，TC-LoRA在生成质量和空间条件遵循上优于静态方法。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA通过权重动态调整，实现了更灵活和高效的条件控制。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Result: 在多个生物医学检测任务中显著优于现有方法，尤其在少样本和开放集场景下。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案，适用于生物医学领域的复杂检测需求。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言动作（VLA）模型虽然通过预训练的视觉语言模型（VLMs）提升了感知能力，但从头训练成本高昂。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1）轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间；2）选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。

Result: 在LIBERO和LIBERO-LONG数据集上分别实现了97.3%和93.5%的成功率，比现有方法显著提升；在真实任务中比教师模型提升了17%。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏有效降低了训练成本，同时使VLMs能够生成精确动作，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on
LIBERO (11.8% improvement) and 93.5% on LIBERO-LONG (24.5% improvement). In
real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个实时处理无限视觉输入的统一框架，通过优化KV缓存和简单监督微调策略，显著提升长视频理解和实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理长视频时面临计算成本高和性能下降的问题，需要一种能够稳定理解无限视觉输入的解决方案。

Method: 采用统一框架，通过重用注意力状态和短窗口视觉令牌，结合监督微调策略，模拟推理时的注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中，StreamingVLM以66.18%的胜率优于GPT-4O mini，并在8 FPS下保持实时性能。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM不仅提升了长视频理解能力，还增强了通用视觉问答能力，无需额外微调。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的框架EDS，通过动态推理干预提升LLM的安全性并减少误拒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐技术仅关注有害提示的安全性，导致LLM对良性提示过度拒绝。

Method: 训练轻量级EBM模型，通过能量梯度动态引导LLM隐藏状态。

Result: 显著降低误拒率（如ORB-H基准从57.3%提升至82.6%），同时保持安全性。

Conclusion: EDS为构建高安全性和低误拒率的LLM提供了有效范例。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个后诊断工具，用于检测和修复大语言模型中的不变性失效问题，如输出翻转和路径依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在无害编辑下可能改变答案，导致实践中的问题，如RAG输出翻转、微调侵蚀预训练的不变性等。这些失效违背了预期的不变性，影响连续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON通过简单的循环和重排序检查，结合无逆曲率图和激活级交换器，生成系统信号。这些信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型。

Result: WILSON能够帮助保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，并在部署中控制融合或重排序。

Conclusion: WILSON通过低成本诊断和修复不变性失效，使模型的可靠性和吞吐量同时提升，而无需改变架构或训练。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

Motivation: 罕见病诊断面临数据不足、基因组测序难以获取等挑战，导致诊断延迟和治疗不当，尤其在资源有限地区。

Method: RareNet利用表型数据构建子图，通过图神经网络预测致病基因，并可与其他方法结合使用。

Result: 在生物医学数据集上表现优异，显著提升其他框架的性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据，适用于资源匮乏地区，为罕见病诊断提供高效工具。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，导致分布偏移，影响模型性能。现有方法未能解决实例内部的分布偏移。

Method: 提出了两种点级方法：学习分布（LD）和学习条件分布（LCD）。LD通过拟合输入和输出的内部分布消除差异，LCD则利用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，两种方法均表现出色，证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能够有效解决时间序列预测中的内部分布偏移问题，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: LeFCert填补了LeFMs少样本分类器认证鲁棒性的空白，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

Conclusion: 提出的尺度不变性方法有效解决了质量指标对尺度敏感的问题，提升了评估的可靠性。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting

propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy

We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,

data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但实际并非如此。通过频域分析发现不同频率带动态特性不同，低频率带相似性高但连续性差，高频率带连续性好但相似性低。

Method: 提出FreqCa，直接重用低频率带特征，使用二阶Hermite插值预测高频率带特征。同时提出缓存累积残差特征（CRF），减少内存占用。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了FreqCa在生成和编辑任务中的有效性，内存占用减少99%。

Conclusion: FreqCa通过频域分析和优化缓存策略，显著降低了扩散变压器的推理成本，同时保持性能。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and

### [102] [Don't Waste Mistakes: Leveraging Negative RL-Groups via Confidence Reweighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08696)
*Yunzhen Feng,Parag Jain,Anthony Hartshorn,Yaqi Duan,Julia Kempe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出LENS方法，通过利用负样本改进GRPO，提升RLVR效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在负样本组中浪费计算资源，LENS旨在利用这些样本提升模型性能。

Method: 从奖励建模的最大似然目标出发，推导出修改后的价值函数，对错误响应施加置信度加权的惩罚。

Result: 在MATH基准测试中，LENS显著优于GRPO基线，尤其在困难任务上表现更佳。

Conclusion: LENS为RLVR提供了一种高效利用负样本的方法，提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于上下文学习（ICL）的非平稳信道均衡问题，提出了一种改进的注意力机制设计框架，并展示了其在动态环境中的优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL方法主要针对静态信道，缺乏对非平稳问题的研究。本文旨在探索ICL在时变信道均衡中的应用潜力。

Method: 通过结合自适应信号处理算法（如LMS、LRMS）设计高效的注意力机制，提升非平稳任务中的适应性和鲁棒性。

Result: 实验表明，ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现优异，且基于经典算法的注意力机制显著提升了动态环境下的性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有潜力，为下一代无线基础模型的开发提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

TL;DR: 实例判别是一种自监督表示学习方法，将数据集中的每个实例视为独立类别。

Abstract: Instance discrimination is a self-supervised representation learning paradigm
wherein individual instances within a dataset are treated as distinct classes.
This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance
by applying stochastic transformations, which encourages the model to learn
representations that are invariant to the common underlying object across these
views.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP)，通过对称化保护属性干预的符合分数，实现了反事实公平的预测集，同时保持了边际覆盖性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在点预测器的反事实公平性方面较为成熟，但在预测集（不确定性下的公平决策核心）方面仍不足。同时，共形预测（CP）虽能提供有效的预测集，但无法保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预的符合分数，开发了CF-CP方法，确保预测集的反事实公平性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，CF-CP实现了反事实公平性，并达到了目标覆盖率，预测集大小仅小幅增加。

Conclusion: CF-CP提供了一种简单、无需训练的途径，实现了反事实公平的不确定性量化。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有技术虽然有效，但多基于经验启发式方法，缺乏理论支持。本文旨在从Transformer架构的基本计算出发，解释这些干预技术的原理。

Method: 基于近期研究发现（Dherin et al., 2025），将理论推广到深层多块Transformer，分析用户提示信息如何通过权重向量和矩阵表示和组合，并推导出将其压缩为独立于令牌的“思想向量”和“思想矩阵”的方法。

Conclusion: 本文为模型干预技术提供了理论基础，并提出了一种新的文本到权重更新的转换方法，具有计算上的可操作性。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于黑盒模型在高风险场景中缺乏可解释性，SHAP分析作为一种可解释AI方法，能够量化特征对预测的贡献，从而增强模型的可信度。

Method: 使用SHAP值量化特征贡献，并通过聚类方法将具有相似预测原因的样本分组，从而揭示不同样本达到相同预测的路径。

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究验证了方法的有效性，并提出了一种多分类的瀑布图泛化方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够增强黑盒模型的可解释性，适用于高风险决策场景，如医疗诊断。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双管齐下的框架，通过替代模型和频谱可预测性分析，解决了复杂时间序列集成模型的解释性和可预测性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代时间序列预测依赖复杂的集成模型，虽然准确性高，但缺乏透明度和可解释性。本文旨在填补这一差距。

Method: 1. 使用LightGBM替代模型模仿AutoGluon的预测，生成稳定的SHAP特征解释；2. 通过频谱可预测性分析量化时间序列的内在可预测性。

Result: 在M5数据集上验证，高频谱可预测性与更高的预测准确性和解释保真度相关。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的实例级解释，并通过可预测性指标帮助用户校准对预测和解释的信任。

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子设计方法在上下文学习中表现有限，且标记数据稀缺，DemoDiff旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用Node Pair Encoding的分子标记器进行可扩展预训练，并在多源数据集上预训练0.7B参数模型。

Result: 在33个设计任务中，DemoDiff表现优于100-1000倍大的语言模型，平均排名3.63。

Conclusion: DemoDiff可作为分子设计的上下文学习基础模型。

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理混合类型表格数据时易丢失语义信息且缺乏可解释性，RFOD旨在解决这些问题。

Method: RFOD将异常检测转化为特征条件重建问题，为每个特征训练随机森林，并结合AGD和UWA进行评分。

Result: 在15个真实数据集上，RFOD在检测准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RFOD为混合类型表格数据的异常检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种控制优化确定性等效（OCE）风险的方法，扩展了传统的CRC框架，并引入了端到端的风险训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型缺乏可证明的风险或可靠性保证，而传统CRC方法无法处理尾部风险且可能影响平均性能。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险的方法，并提出了端到端的“conformal risk training”方法。

Result: 方法在控制分类器的假阴性率和电池存储操作的金融风险中表现出色。

Conclusion: 新方法提供了可证明的风险保证，并显著提升了平均性能。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习记忆化检测技术仅关注单样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于联邦学习。

Method: 提出了一个框架，量化联邦学习中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化，并进行了两项研究：测量跨客户端记忆化和分析影响因素。

Result: 发现联邦学习模型会记忆客户端数据，尤其是客户端内数据，且记忆化受训练和推理因素影响。

Conclusion: 填补了联邦学习记忆化检测的空白，揭示了记忆化的特点和影响因素。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为LOTION的框架，通过随机噪声平滑量化损失表面，解决了量化目标优化中梯度不连续的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络目标时，量化器的分段常数特性导致梯度为零或未定义，现有方法（如STE）缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 采用Nesterov平滑思想，用随机舍入噪声的期望近似量化损失表面，确保标准优化器能收敛到局部最小值。

Result: 实验表明，LOTION在合成测试集和150M/300M参数语言模型上优于标准QAT方法。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一种有理论保证的量化优化方法，保留了原始量化损失的全局最优性。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder显著提高了效应估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该方法在结构化数据中推动了稳健的因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

Conclusion: 该方法展示了虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合在CT协议管理中的潜力。

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RL在稀疏奖励环境中探索效率低的问题，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些建议。

Result: 在复杂任务中，最终成功率提升71%，样本效率提高9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用LLM规划能力，加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于基函数预训练的可重用初始化框架，用于解决神经网络函数逼近中的训练挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络训练中的三个主要问题：需要从头训练新模型、对架构和超参数敏感、泛化能力差。

Method: 通过预训练基神经网络逼近多项式函数，并利用其参数初始化目标函数网络，结合域映射机制增强适应性。

Result: 在一维和二维实验中显著提高了训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性。

Conclusion: 初始化策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

Conclusion: 提出的算法能自适应探索难度，数值实验验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Result: 在Burgers方程等基准问题上表现优异，误差降低48%，并在其他基准上达到竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN在物理一致性和计算效率上优于现有方法，适用于复杂PDE问题。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Conclusion: TAPAS数据集为AI研究LWE攻击提供了实用工具，推动了该领域发展。

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out

Motivation: 在线教育中学习者的情感理解对提高参与度和个性化教学至关重要，但现有方法假设模态输入始终可靠且采用静态融合策略，难以适应真实学习环境。

Method: Edu-EmotionNet包含三个关键模块：跨模态注意力对齐（CMAA）、模态重要性估计器（MIE）和时间反馈循环（TFL），分别用于动态上下文共享、模态权重分配和时间一致性建模。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI的教育子集上，Edu-EmotionNet实现了最先进的性能，并对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Edu-EmotionNet能有效捕捉情感变化并自适应优先可靠信号，适合实时学习系统部署。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Result: 小型模型在图形参数预测任务中表现良好，LoRA微调显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 小型语言模型具备图形结构推理能力，轻量级微调可有效提升其性能。

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Result: 在多个长尾基准数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缓解多数类偏向，同时保留数据集中的有价值信息。

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via
extensive experiments. Our code is available at

Motivation: 边缘环境中的资源动态性和不可预测性（如图像质量下降、网络不稳定）对3D重建的可靠性提出了挑战。

Method: 采用两个协作的Q-learning代理（相机选择和服务器选择），在线学习策略以适应边缘环境。

Result: 在动态环境中有效平衡了端到端延迟和重建质量，提高了应用可靠性。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限和易受干扰的环境中实现了高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 现有公平性研究多集中于医学影像诊断任务，忽视了预后场景中的公平性问题，FairTTE旨在填补这一空白。

Method: FairTTE整合了先进的TTE预测和公平性算法，利用因果分析技术识别和量化数据集中的偏见来源。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见普遍存在，现有公平性方法效果有限，且公平性在分布变化下难以维持。

Conclusion: 需要更全面、鲁棒的公平性方法来解决医学影像预后中的偏见问题。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

Motivation: 研究动机是探究CL和NSCL不仅在目标函数层面相似，是否在表示层面也保持一致，以理解自监督与监督学习之间的联系。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较CL和NSCL在共享随机性（相同初始化、批次和数据增强）下的表示对齐性，并分析其与类别数量、温度参数和批次大小的关系。

Result: 结果表明，CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，且对齐性随类别数量和温度的增加而增强。参数空间的对齐性则不稳定。

Conclusion: NSCL可以作为自监督和监督学习之间的桥梁，其与CL的表示对齐性为理解自监督学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

Motivation: 当前稀疏自编码器训练中存在特征吸收问题，影响模型行为的识别和分析。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上，ATM显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持高质量重构。

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的特征提供了理论基础，增强了模型分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

Conclusion: SCA方法能更精细地捕捉神经调谐轴，揭示了DNNs与人类视觉系统的表征差异。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

Conclusion: Dig-DEC在对抗性环境中表现优异，且函数估计方法的改进显著提升了性能。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

TL;DR: ACPO是一个分阶段的框架，通过动态调节策略熵和精确量化推理步骤的贡献，解决了RLVR中探索与利用的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR方法在探索与利用的平衡上存在问题，导致中间步骤的信用分配不准确和过早的熵崩溃，限制了模型性能。

Method: ACPO采用难度感知课程、轨迹语义分割和基于归因的表征来动态调节策略熵，并通过因子化奖励系统精确量化推理步骤的贡献。

Result: 在AIME、MATH和AMC等基准测试中，ACPO显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ACPO通过改进探索与利用的平衡，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 该理论为经典算法提供了新颖的物理解释，并为设计下一代自适应参数调整算法奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Motivation: 解决因数据包碰撞和车辆速度相关信道不确定性导致的AoI恶化问题。

Method: 建立了受车辆速度、密度和RRI影响的AoI计算模型，设计了双路径优化方案，结合DDPG和LLM进行优化。

Result: 实验表明，LLM无需训练即可显著降低AoI，而DDPG在训练后表现更稳定。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG的结合能有效优化IoV中的AoI问题，LLM适用于快速部署，DDPG适合长期稳定性能。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 小规模地球数据具有时空相关性，但传统深度学习方法需要针对不同场景进行特定训练，而基础模型则存在预测偏差。

Method: 通过量化小规模地球数据的时空模式，并利用表格基础模型进行预测。

Result: 在三种典型场景中，该方法比图深度学习模型（T-GCN）和表格基础模型（TabPFN）表现更优，具有更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法简单且鲁棒，适用于小规模地球数据的时空预测。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Result: AB-PINNs能有效解决复杂多尺度偏微分方程，减少超参数调优需求。

Conclusion: AB-PINNs为多尺度问题提供了一种灵活且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

Method: 引入分层概率哈希方法量化特征组合的置信度，生成多路径推理并聚合预测结果。

Result: 离线和在线实验验证了MATT的兼容性和有效性。

Conclusion: MATT能够显著提升CTR模型的预测鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

<details>

Motivation: 传统EDL方法依赖静态超参数，难以适应动态数据分布，导致校准和泛化能力不足。

Method: 采用双层优化：内层通过动态配置的损失函数更新模型参数；外层通过策略网络优化KL散度系数和Dirichlet先验强度。

Result: 实验表明，MPC显著提升了模型预测的可靠性、校准性和准确性。

Conclusion: MPC通过动态调整不确定性建模参数，有效解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Traditional Evidence Deep Learning (EDL) methods rely on static
hyperparameter for uncertainty calibration, limiting their adaptability in
dynamic data distributions, which results in poor calibration and
generalization in high-risk decision-making tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose the Meta-Policy Controller (MPC), a dynamic meta-learning framework
that adjusts the KL divergence coefficient and Dirichlet prior strengths for
optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

Result: 在多个领域的数据集上，VARNN表现出色，测试MSE更低且计算开销小。

Conclusion: VARNN在漂移和波动环境下具有鲁棒性，是时间序列学习的有前景框架。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

Result: 在九种场景下，LAGA显著提升了图质量，并在多种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据中心的图质量优化是提升TAGs可靠性和图学习鲁棒性的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in

research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably

investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Conclusion: HiBBO弥合了高维序列表示学习与高效贝叶斯优化之间的差距，拓展了应用领域。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture

Conclusion: LOs能够内化正则化特性，挑战传统显式正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

Result: RLER性能比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，实现了稳定的无标注数据扩展。

Conclusion: RLER是一种高效且稳定的方法，适用于无标注数据的强化学习扩展。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

Conclusion: FedL2T是一种可靠且个性化的解决方案，适用于隐私敏感的癫痫预测任务。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了通用基础，提升了LLM的规划效率、约束对齐性和领域适应性。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Motivation: 现有HW-NAS方法因高时间成本、手动分析和跨平台扩展性差，难以实际部署。

Method: PlatformX整合了能量驱动的搜索空间、可迁移的核级能量预测器、多目标搜索算法和高分辨率运行时能量分析系统。

Result: 在多个移动平台上，PlatformX显著降低了搜索开销，同时保持了准确性和能量效率，优于MobileNet-V2。

Conclusion: PlatformX为边缘设备设计高效DNN提供了一种实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

*Ziyi Wang,Nan Jiang,Guang Lin,Qifan Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于贝叶斯变分学习的统一框架（SQS），同时进行剪枝和低比特量化，实现了更高的压缩率和可比的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模神经网络压缩对于资源受限设备部署至关重要，现有方法单独使用剪枝或量化，压缩率不理想。

Method: 采用尖峰和平板先验诱导稀疏性，并用高斯混合模型（GMM）建模量化权重，实现低比特精度。

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上实验，压缩率优于现有方法，性能下降可接受。

Conclusion: SQS框架在保持性能的同时实现了更高的压缩率，为神经网络压缩提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

*Changsheng Wang,Yihua Zhang,Dennis Wei,Jinghan Jia,Pin-Yu Chen,Sijia Liu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现，即使在低质量或扰动的遗忘数据下，大语言模型（LLM）的遗忘方法仍能保持鲁棒性，核心语义信号是关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在伦理和安全问题中因记忆敏感数据、强化偏见和生成有害内容而引发的遗忘需求，尤其是在遗忘数据质量不佳时的可靠性问题。

Method: 系统评估了两种先进的LLM遗忘方法（RMU和NPO）在噪声遗忘数据集上的表现，并提出基于显著性的解释。

Result: 遗忘方法对扰动表现出鲁棒性，只要核心语义信号保留；遗忘主要由深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式驱动。

Conclusion: LLM遗忘算法在噪声数据下仍可靠，语义信号是遗忘的关键驱动因素。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为VGA的新机制，通过直接打破极端令牌现象的循环，提升Transformer模型的性能、量化保真度和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer大模型存在极端令牌现象（如注意力沉没和值状态流失），导致性能下降、量化保真度降低和可解释性变差。

Method: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)，通过可学习的、数据依赖的门控机制，直接从值向量计算门控信号，调节输出。

Result: VGA显著减少了注意力沉没的形成，稳定了值状态范数，提升了性能、量化保真度和模型可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA是一种简单、专用且稳定的机制，能有效解决极端令牌现象，提升模型表现。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注静态模型调度，忽略了动态硬件和运行时条件的适应性。

Method: 结合PPO全局路由和本地贪心调度器，管理模型宽度和批处理配置。

Result: 相比随机基线，显著降低延迟（96.45%）和能耗（97.31%），同时支持精度与性能的权衡。

Conclusion: 分层设计有效平衡效率与吞吐量，适用于动态模型推理场景。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

Motivation: 现有研究在配体设计中存在伪从头设计、有限的对接建模和不灵活的配体类型等问题，MagicDock旨在解决这些问题。

Method: MagicDock采用梯度反演框架和可微分表面建模，结合可学习的3D点云表示，支持灵活的配体类型设计。

Conclusion: MagicDock通过创新的方法解决了配体设计中的关键问题，并在实验中验证了其优越性。

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估ML训练的环境可持续性，尤其是硬件生产和能源消耗的影响。

Method: 通过分析过去十年中著名AI系统（如大语言模型）的训练过程，重点关注显卡的生命周期。

Result: 研究发现显卡生产影响持续增加，训练能耗和环境影响呈指数增长，优化策略无法抵消反弹效应。

Conclusion: 结论是仅提高效率无法确保ML的可持续性，需减少训练活动并考虑全生命周期影响。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

Motivation: 当前对语言模型防御的评估方法存在缺陷，通常仅针对静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用自适应攻击策略，结合梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导优化等方法，系统测试12种防御措施。

Result: 大多数防御措施的攻击成功率超过90%，而原报告中的攻击成功率接近零。

Conclusion: 未来防御研究需考虑更强的攻击方法，以确保鲁棒性评估的可靠性。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

Motivation: 研究优化器在训练过程中如何影响收敛点的特征，尤其是避免尖锐极小值。

Method: 理论分析结合广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，提出两种新算法。

Result: 新算法能更有效地过滤特征值，促进更宽的极小值。

Conclusion: 优化器的超参数决定了其特征值过滤行为，新算法在实验中表现良好。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

Result: 实验表明IGCARL在对抗攻击下的成功率比现有方法提高至少27.9%。

Conclusion: IGCARL显著提升了DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

Conclusion: 分割技术与异构集成的结合显著提升了异常检测性能，未来计划进一步研究加权特征以优化模型表现。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决CTC瓶颈，提升语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

Result: BioCodec在多种任务（如临床诊断、睡眠生理学、语音解码等）中表现优异，尤其在低资源环境下。

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号标记化提供了通用解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，并适用于其他生物信号（如EMG）。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Motivation: 在大语言模型训练中，动量广泛使用但内存消耗大，需要一种内存高效的优化器。

Method: AdaPM采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块使用部分动量，并通过偏差校正技术减少性能损失。

Result: 实验显示，AdaPM减少90%以上动量内存，保持性能，并节省30%以上GPU训练时间。

Conclusion: AdaPM是一种高效的内存优化策略，适用于大规模语言模型训练。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

generated adversarial examples, referred to as 'Memory Adversarial Examples,'
to enhance model robustness and accuracy without compromising performance on
clean data. By using these examples across training epochs, MemLoss provides a
balanced improvement in both natural accuracy and adversarial robustness.
Experimental results on multiple datasets, including CIFAR-10, demonstrate that
our method achieves better accuracy compared to existing adversarial training
methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

*Zhi Yang,Changwu Huang,Ke Tang,Xin Yao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的成员推断游戏和自适应梯度裁剪策略，以更严格地评估和减少群体隐私风险差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法低估了群体隐私风险差异，且评估最坏情况隐私风险的方法耗时。

Method: 引入成员推断游戏评估近似最坏情况隐私风险，并改进DP-SGD算法，采用自适应群体梯度裁剪策略。

Result: 实验证明新方法能更严格评估群体隐私风险差异，并有效减少差异。

Conclusion: 新方法提升了差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

*Orin Levy,Liad Erez,Alon Cohen,Yishay Mansour*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了在延迟反馈下的上下文多臂老虎机问题（CMAB）的遗憾最小化算法，分别在有限策略类和一般函数逼近设置下给出了最优遗憾界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在延迟反馈环境下CMAB问题的遗憾最小化挑战，特别是在对抗性延迟和一般函数逼近场景中。

Method: 1. 有限策略类下直接访问策略类；2. 一般函数逼近设置中使用在线最小二乘回归预言机。

Result: 有限策略类下遗憾界为O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；一般函数逼近下为O(√(KT R_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))。

Conclusion: 算法在延迟反馈下表现良好，但一般函数逼近的遗憾界与下界存在√d_max的差距。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了通过成对比较进行密度估计的方法，适用于专家知识提取和人类反馈学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是利用专家知识和人类反馈，通过成对比较来估计目标密度。

Method: 方法包括将未观测到的目标密度与“温控胜者密度”关联，通过分数匹配学习胜者分数，并通过“去温控”估计目标密度。

Result: 结果表明，信念密度和胜者密度的分数向量共线，且通过位置相关的温控场连接。

Conclusion: 结论是该方法可以从数百到数千次成对比较中学习复杂的多元信念密度。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Logits Replay + MoClip框架通过压缩监督信号和稳定优化，提升LLMs在特定领域的性能，同时减少计算成本和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLMs在领域适应中性能提升与通用能力保持之间的矛盾，同时降低计算成本。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录动态Top-K token子集；Stage 1重放子集计算损失，结合MoClip优化器稳定训练。

Result: 在CT和NL2SQL任务中提升性能，减少通用基准（MMLU等）的遗忘，训练成本降低40%。

Conclusion: 提供了一种可扩展、架构无关的LLMs领域适应方法，兼顾性能和通用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

Motivation: 解决现有知识增强LLM依赖静态知识库导致的覆盖不足和时效性差的问题。

Method: 引入动态模式扩展、检索增强记忆系统和可学习多尺度提示压缩三项创新技术。

Result: 实验显示在知识提取任务中优于监督基线和单轮RL方法，与GraphRAG结合后在问答任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR通过协同进化机制有效提升了LLM在动态环境中的知识处理能力。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于评估实践不一致，EHR数据的最佳表示方法尚不明确，因此需要系统性比较。

Method: 通过标准化的数据整理和评估，比较了时间序列、事件流和文本事件流三种表示方法，并分析了特征修剪的影响。

Result: 事件流模型表现最佳，预训练模型在少样本场景下高效，特征选择策略需根据临床环境调整。

Conclusion: 研究结果为基于临床环境和数据情况选择EHR表示方法提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为WASI的方法，通过限制训练在固定子空间内，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了与传统训练相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的普及，能源消耗和数据隐私成为重要问题。设备端学习虽然能解决这些问题，但现代神经网络的规模扩大成为主要障碍。

Method: 采用基于子空间的训练方法，提出Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI)，通过限制训练在固定子空间内，减少内存和计算开销。

Result: WASI在保持与传统训练相当的准确性的同时，内存使用减少62倍，计算成本（FLOPs）减少2倍，在Raspberry Pi 5上训练和推理速度提升1.5倍。

Conclusion: WASI是一种高效的方法，适用于设备端学习，能够显著降低资源消耗并提升效率。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new

robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有功能脑网络建模方法局限于局部成对交互，难以捕捉高阶依赖关系，且计算负担大。

Method: 通过引入四种全局约束（信号同步、被试身份、预期边数、数据标签），实现多分辨率（样本/被试/组/项目）的FBN结构学习。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置中，GCM相比9种基线方法和10种先进方法，准确率提升30.6%，计算时间减少96.3%。

Conclusion: GCM为FBN结构学习提供了新视角，并支持跨学科应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

Motivation: 解决深度学习中非确定性和不可重现性问题，特别是浮点计算的不一致性。

Result: RepDL能够在不同计算环境中提供确定性和比特级可重现的结果。

Conclusion: RepDL有效解决了浮点计算不一致性问题，提升了深度学习的可重现性。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

Result: backGP方法平均减少遗忘10.8%，提高准确率12.7%。

Conclusion: 新任务训练是隐式对抗攻击，backGP方法有效缓解了灾难性遗忘。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

Motivation: 现有提示优化方法仅针对文本，限制了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的潜力，因此需要扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出MPO框架，通过对齐保持更新联合优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯策略指导候选提示选择。

Result: 实验表明，MPO在图像、视频等非文本模态上优于现有文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现MLLMs潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Result: 显著提升了学习效率、泛化能力和鲁棒性，尤其在次优专家数据下表现突出。

Conclusion: 通过学生策略和教师FM模型的结合，有效解决了FM模型的局限性，实现了高效在线学习。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Method: 提出了一种新的最小充分原因（prime implicant explanations）定义，并设计了一种算法在小规模反应预测任务中计算这些解释。

Result: 初步实验表明，该方法能够保守地捕捉真实解释，虽然可能包含冗余的原子和键，但能一致地捕获预测反应可行性的关键分子属性。

Conclusion: 该方法为化学反应预测模型提供了可解释性，有助于理解模型的决策过程。

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as
minimally sufficient reasons--tailored to this domain, and propose an algorithm
for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Method: 提出了一种两层次框架，通过添加合成异常值来评估模型稳定性。

Conclusion: 合成异常值是一种有效的漂移缓解方法，但需根据具体情况调整。

Abstract: Machine Learning models in finance are highly susceptible to model drift,
where predictive performance declines as data distributions shift. This issue
is especially acute in developing economies such as those in Central Asia and
the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型（LLM）的广泛应用，多样化的提示数据集涌现，但缺乏系统性分析和优化方法。

Method: 收集并分析多源提示数据集，提出基于句法嵌入的提示优化方法，通过重写提示向中心表示靠拢。

Result: 优化后的提示提升了模型输出的意义，数据集和代码已公开。

Conclusion: 系统性分析和优化提示能显著提升LLM的性能和实用性。

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统代数环在仿真中效率低，且存在多解问题，需要一种高效且一致的替代方法。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，直接在损失函数中利用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统中，仿真时间减少60%，同时保持相同精度。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了代数环的效率和多解问题，适用于大规模系统仿真。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

Conclusion: MAIL-WARM是首个理论最优的交互式MAIL算法，填补了理论空白并验证了其实际效果。

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

TL;DR: 提出了一种不依赖模型内部结构的黑箱安全对齐框架，通过零和博弈平衡安全性和有用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对齐方法成本高且不灵活，需要重新训练或访问模型内部，不适合第三方利益相关者。

Result: 证明了黑箱安全对齐的可行性，为资源受限的利益相关者提供了可扩展的安全保障途径。

Conclusion: 该框架为快速发展的LLM生态系统提供了一种无需重新训练或访问模型内部的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Motivation: 生成模型评估中，标准指标常无法反映人类偏好，而人工评估虽可靠但成本高且噪声大。

Method: 提出BBQ方法，通过贝叶斯建模评分者质量，使用EM算法保证单调似然收敛。

Result: BBQ比基线模型收敛更快，提供校准的不确定性估计和更鲁棒的排名。

Conclusion: BBQ框架为生成模型提供了更可靠且成本效益更高的人工评估方法。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Motivation: 铁路网络的运营效率因列车延误的级联效应而受损，现有研究缺乏网络级多步预测和实时解释能力。

Method: 采用两阶段自回归GAT模型，结合时空图和细粒度特征（如站台拥堵）。

Result: GATv2模型在MAE上不如基线，但在延误事件分类上更精确。

Conclusion: 该框架为实时决策支持提供了可靠工具，尤其在延误分类上表现优异。

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Motivation: 研究当前LLM预训练中计算高效近似方法的性能损失，探索高斯-牛顿预条件的潜力。

Method: 应用全高斯-牛顿预条件方法于150M参数的Transformer模型，并与SOAP、Muon等基线优化器对比。

Result: 全GN方法将训练迭代次数减少5.4倍，分层GN预条件器性能接近全GN方法。

Conclusion: 高斯-牛顿近似对预条件非常有效，分层Hessian结构已能实现大部分性能提升，现有近似方法与理想分层方法存在显著差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管softmax注意力在序列模型中表现优异，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，而线性替代方法（如SSMs）的效率更高，但信息处理的差异尚不明确。

Method: 利用动态系统框架将不同注意力机制表示为动态系统，通过分析特征值谱进行结构化比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试中进行实证分析。

Result: 特征值影响记忆和长程依赖建模，其谱特征与任务需求一致；架构修改会同时影响特征值谱和任务性能。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为理解、解释和改进序列模型能力提供了原则性指标。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

Motivation: 现有情感识别中的课程学习方法忽视人类感知难度，而CHUCKLE通过标注者一致性解决这一问题。

Method: 利用众包数据中的标注者一致性和对齐性定义样本难度，构建感知驱动的课程学习框架。

Result: CHUCKLE将LSTM和Transformer的相对平均准确率分别提高6.56%和1.61%，同时减少梯度更新次数。

Conclusion: CHUCKLE通过人类感知难度优化课程学习，显著提升模型性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

TL;DR: STaTS是一种轻量级、无监督的时间序列压缩框架，通过自适应检测变化点并压缩序列，保留核心动态，显著降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据通常包含潜在的时间结构，但现有模型往往忽略这些结构，导致效率低下和鲁棒性差。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则检测多分辨率变化点，并用均值或GMM等函数压缩每个段。

Result: 在150多个数据集上，STaTS实现了高达30倍的序列压缩，同时保留了85-90%的模型性能。

Conclusion: STaTS是一种高效、结构感知的时间序列建模通用解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法（如GRPO）在任务难度超过模型能力时表现不佳，导致奖励稀疏和训练低效。低训练亲和性是核心问题。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，HINT表现优于现有方法，实现了最先进的结果，并显著提升了学习稳定性和数据效率。

Conclusion: HINT通过自适应提示有效解决了低训练亲和性问题，为LLM的复杂推理任务提供了更高效的训练方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 该框架不仅解释了现有模型的成功，还为设计新序列模型提供了系统性指导原则。

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Result: 在多接收器数据集上，平均准确率提升10%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了接收器变异性问题，提升了RFFI的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

Motivation: 探讨权重初始化如何影响深度学习的训练稳定性，尤其是在不同网络架构中的表现。

Method: 通过对数扫描初始标准差，比较Kaiming和Xavier初始化方法，并在GPT-2风格模型中跟踪权重方差变化。

Conclusion: 研究连接了经典初始化原则与现代Transformer行为，提供了简单实用的训练建议。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

TL;DR: 论文提出正交对齐现象，指出交叉注意力机制不仅能去除冗余信息，还能发现新信息，从而提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索交叉注意力机制在跨域序列推荐中的潜在机制，超越传统的冗余对齐观点。

Method: 通过300多次实验验证正交对齐现象，并分析其对模型性能的影响。

Result: 正交对齐显著提升模型性能，且无需显式正交约束。

Conclusion: 正交对齐为多模态研究中的参数高效扩展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

*Faried Abu Zaid,Tim Katzke,Emmanuel Müller,Daniel Neider*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种统一的无监督异常检测方法，通过均匀缩放流（USFs）连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无监督异常检测方法主要分为深度单类分类和密度估计两种范式，但二者之间的联系尚未明确。本文旨在通过USFs建立这两种方法的理论联系。

Method: 通过证明USFs的最大似然训练等价于带有独特正则化的Deep SVDD目标，从而将两种方法统一起来。

Result: 实验表明，USFs在多个基准测试和模型架构中均能提升性能，并显著改善训练稳定性。

Conclusion: USFs不仅统一了两种主要异常检测范式，还提升了实际性能，为理论和实践提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

TL;DR: 论文研究了针对AI控制协议的适应性攻击，展示了前沿模型如何通过嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入来逃避监控并完成恶意任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI控制协议依赖LLM监控器，可能成为单点故障，研究适应性攻击有助于揭示其盲点。

Method: 通过适应性攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，测试监控器的防御能力。

Result: 前沿模型成功逃避多种监控器，并在两个主要AI控制基准上完成恶意任务。

Conclusion: 适应性攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding
within 12 months, patent-stock growth within 24 months, and exit through an
initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later
cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence
weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit
predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing
transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Conclusion: 局部框架为私有采样与公共数据结合提供自然模型，局部最优采样器在实验中表现优于全局方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Conclusion: MB-AIL在理论和实践中均表现出色，为在线模仿学习提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

Motivation: 现有物理和数据驱动模型因数据异质性和样本不足难以泛化到不同空间区域和尺度，需要一种新方法提升泛化能力。

Method: 提出Geo-STARS框架，结合地理嵌入和门控时空图神经网络，利用地理信息捕捉跨区域和尺度的共享模式。

Result: 在37年美国东海岸流域数据上，Geo-STARS在区域和尺度上均优于现有方法，展示了卓越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS为高效、可扩展的环境监测和决策提供了新思路。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

Conclusion: MODE能有效区分细胞增殖与分化动态，并预测细胞命运决定时间，解决了计算生物学中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.

TL;DR: BaNEL（贝叶斯负证据学习）是一种仅利用失败尝试进行后训练并最小化奖励评估次数的算法，显著提升了稀疏奖励任务中的模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在重要问题的最难实例中，基础生成模型可能获得接近零的奖励信号，且奖励评估成本高昂，这提出了不同于标准奖励后训练的学习挑战。

Method: BaNEL将学习失败尝试的规律性问题转化为另一个生成建模问题，并利用该模型评估新数据是否与已知失败相似，从而引导生成远离失败。

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中，无需观察成功样本即可提升模型性能，成功率比现有新颖性奖励方法高出多个数量级，且奖励评估次数更少。

Conclusion: BaNEL通过专注于失败尝试的学习，有效解决了稀疏奖励环境中的生成模型优化问题。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Motivation: 在复杂环境中，多机器人协作推动物体时，接触点的选择问题因组合爆炸而难以扩展，而人类依赖常识推理解决类似问题，因此尝试结合LLM的推理能力。

Method: 提出ConPoSe方法，结合LLM的推理能力和局部搜索技术，选择适合的接触点。

Result: ConPoSe在多种形状（如长方体、圆柱体和T形）上表现良好，比纯解析方法和纯LLM方法更具可扩展性和性能优势。

Conclusion: ConPoSe通过结合LLM和局部搜索，有效解决了多机器人协作推动物体时的接触点选择问题，为复杂环境中的物体运输提供了新思路。

Abstract: Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in
various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In
cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects
that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which
only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact
points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this
selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially
with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by
how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose
combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search
to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for
contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a
variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate
that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the
analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.

Abstract: Operating high degree of freedom robots can be difficult for users of
wheelchair mounted robotic manipulators. Mode switching in Cartesian space has
several drawbacks such as unintuitive control reference frames, separate
translation and orientation control, and limited movement capabilities that
hinder performance. We propose Point and Go mode switching, which reallocates
the Cartesian mode switching reference frames into a more intuitive action
space comprised of new translation and rotation modes. We use a novel sweeping
motion to point the gripper, which defines the new translation axis along the
robot base frame's horizontal plane. This creates an intuitive `point and go'
translation mode that allows the user to easily perform complex, human-like
movements without switching control modes. The system's rotation mode combines
position control with a refined end-effector oriented frame that provides
precise and consistent robot actions in various end-effector poses. We verified
its effectiveness through initial experiments, followed by a three-task user
study that compared our method to Cartesian mode switching and a state of the
art learning method. Results show that Point and Go mode switching reduced
completion times by 31\%, pauses by 41\%, and mode switches by 33\%, while
receiving significantly favorable responses in user surveys.

Abstract: Developing table tennis robots that mirror human speed, accuracy, and ability
to predict and respond to the full range of ball spins remains a significant
challenge for legged robots. To demonstrate these capabilities we present a
system to play dynamic table tennis for quadrupedal robots that integrates high
speed perception, trajectory prediction, and agile control. Our system uses
external cameras for high-speed ball localization, physical models with learned
residuals to infer spin and predict trajectories, and a novel model predictive
control (MPC) formulation for agile full-body control. Notably, a continuous
set of stroke strategies emerge automatically from different ball return
objectives using this control paradigm. We demonstrate our system in the real
world on a Spot quadruped, evaluate accuracy of each system component, and
exhibit coordination through the system's ability to aim and return balls with
varying spin types. As a further demonstration, the system is able to rally
with human players.

TL;DR: GPI将演示视为几何曲线而非状态-动作样本，通过距离场生成控制原语，实现高效、可解释的模仿学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习将演示视为状态-动作样本，缺乏几何直观性，GPI旨在通过几何曲线重新思考模仿学习。

Method: GPI从几何曲线中推导距离场，生成两种控制原语（推进流和吸引流），形成非参数化向量场指导机器人行为。

Result: GPI在仿真和真实机器人任务中表现优于扩散策略，运行速度快20倍，内存需求更低，且对扰动鲁棒。

Conclusion: GPI是一种高效、可解释、可扩展的机器人模仿学习替代方案，优于生成式方法。

Abstract: We propose a Geometry-aware Policy Imitation (GPI) approach that rethinks
imitation learning by treating demonstrations as geometric curves rather than
collections of state-action samples. From these curves, GPI derives distance
fields that give rise to two complementary control primitives: a progression
flow that advances along expert trajectories and an attraction flow that
corrects deviations. Their combination defines a controllable, non-parametric
vector field that directly guides robot behavior. This formulation decouples
metric learning from policy synthesis, enabling modular adaptation across
low-dimensional robot states and high-dimensional perceptual inputs. GPI
naturally supports multimodality by preserving distinct demonstrations as
separate models and allows efficient composition of new demonstrations through
simple additions to the distance field. We evaluate GPI in simulation and on
real robots across diverse tasks. Experiments show that GPI achieves higher
success rates than diffusion-based policies while running 20 times faster,
requiring less memory, and remaining robust to perturbations. These results
establish GPI as an efficient, interpretable, and scalable alternative to
generative approaches for robotic imitation learning. Project website:

Abstract: From loco-motion to dextrous manipulation, humanoid robots have made
remarkable strides in demonstrating complex full-body capabilities. However,
the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on
stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either
confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking
human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few
standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on
humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and
diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety
involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction,
locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient
human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates
high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile
inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k
trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad
categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy
learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and
limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we
introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to
seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive
performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy
learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend
to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the
groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world
scenarios. Our dataset, data collection code, and cloud evaluation website are
made publicly available on our project website.

Conclusion: 该框架能实时推断人类意图并调整运动，提升人机协作的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires robots to adapt their motions to
human intent to ensure safe and efficient cooperation in shared spaces.
Although large language models (LLMs) provide high-level reasoning for
inferring human intent, their application to reliable motion planning in HRC
remains challenging. Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is intuitive but
often relies on continuous kinesthetic guidance, which imposes burdens on
operators. To address these challenges, a contact-informed adaptive
motion-planning framework is introduced to infer human intent directly from
physical contact and employ the inferred intent for online motion correction in
HRC. First, an optimization-based force estimation method is proposed to infer
human-intended contact forces and locations from joint torque measurements and
a robot dynamics model, thereby reducing cost and installation complexity while
enabling whole-body sensitivity. Then, a torque-based contact detection
mechanism with link-level localization is introduced to reduce the optimization
search space and to enable real-time estimation. Subsequently, a
contact-informed adaptive motion planner is developed to infer human intent
from contacts and to replan robot motion online, while maintaining smoothness
and adapting to human corrections. Finally, experiments on a 7-DOF manipulator
are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed force estimation
method and the effectiveness of the contact-informed adaptive motion planner
under perception uncertainty in HRC.

Conclusion: 该方法在资源受限环境下显著提升了科学数据的可靠性和计算效率。

Abstract: Deep space missions face extreme communication delays and environmental
uncertainty that prevent real-time ground operations. To support autonomous
science operations in communication-constrained environments, we present a
partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework that adaptively
sequences spacecraft science instruments. We integrate a Bayesian network into
the POMDP observation space to manage the high-dimensional and uncertain
measurements typical of astrobiology missions. This network compactly encodes
dependencies among measurements and improves the interpretability and
computational tractability of science data. Instrument operation policies are
computed offline, allowing resource-aware plans to be generated and thoroughly
validated prior to launch. We use the Enceladus Orbilander's proposed Life
Detection Suite (LDS) as a case study, demonstrating how Bayesian network
structure and reward shaping influence system performance. We compare our
method against the mission's baseline Concept of Operations (ConOps),
evaluating both misclassification rates and performance in off-nominal sample
accumulation scenarios. Our approach reduces sample identification errors by
nearly 40%

Result: 在五个模拟任务中，CDE实现高效探索，并在真实机械臂任务中达到80%成功率。

Conclusion: CDE通过概念重构减少对外部模型的依赖，提升探索效率和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Intelligent exploration remains a critical challenge in reinforcement
learning (RL), especially in visual control tasks. Unlike low-dimensional
state-based RL, visual RL must extract task-relevant structure from raw pixels,
making exploration inefficient. We propose Concept-Driven Exploration (CDE),
which leverages a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to generate
object-centric visual concepts from textual task descriptions as weak,
potentially noisy supervisory signals. Rather than directly conditioning on
these noisy signals, CDE trains a policy to reconstruct the concepts via an
auxiliary objective, using reconstruction accuracy as an intrinsic reward to
guide exploration toward task-relevant objects. Because the policy internalizes
these concepts, VLM queries are only needed during training, reducing
dependence on external models during deployment. Across five challenging
simulated visual manipulation tasks, CDE achieves efficient, targeted
exploration and remains robust to noisy VLM predictions. Finally, we
demonstrate real-world transfer by deploying CDE on a Franka Research 3 arm,
attaining an 80\% success rate in a real-world manipulation task.

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于现有松耦合方法，并发布了首个开源数据集以促进研究。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of intrinsic (odometer scaling factors) and extrinsic
parameters (IMU-odometer translation and rotation) is essential for autonomous
ground vehicle localization. Existing GNSS-aided approaches often rely on
positioning results or raw measurements without ambiguity resolution, and their
observability properties remain underexplored. This paper proposes a tightly
coupled online calibration method that fuses IMU, odometer, and raw GNSS
measurements (pseudo-range, carrier-phase, and Doppler) within an extendable
factor graph optimization (FGO) framework, incorporating outlier mitigation and
ambiguity resolution. Observability analysis reveals that two horizontal
translation and three rotation parameters are observable under general motion,
while vertical translation remains unobservable. Simulation and real-world
experiments demonstrate superior calibration and localization performance over
state-of-the-art loosely coupled methods. Specifically, the IMU-odometer
positioning using our calibrated parameters achieves the absolute maximum error
of 17.75 m while the one of LC method is 61.51 m, achieving up to 71.14 percent
improvement. To foster further research, we also release the first open-source
dataset that combines IMU, 2D odometer, and raw GNSS measurements from both
rover and base stations.

Abstract: In-Hand Manipulation, as many other dexterous tasks, remains a difficult
challenge in robotics by combining complex dynamic systems with the capability
to control and manoeuvre various objects using its actuators. This work
presents the application of a previously developed hybrid Reinforcement
Learning (RL) Framework to In-Hand Manipulation task, verifying that it is
capable of improving the performance of the task. The model combines concepts
of both Model-Free and Model-Based Reinforcement Learning, by guiding a trained
policy with the help of a dynamic model and value-function through trajectory
evaluation, as done in Model Predictive Control. This work evaluates the
performance of the model by comparing it with the policy that will be guided.
To fully explore this, various tests are performed using both fully-actuated
and under-actuated simulated robotic hands to manipulate different objects for
a given task. The performance of the model will also be tested for
generalization tests, by changing the properties of the objects in which both
the policy and dynamic model were trained, such as density and size, and
additionally by guiding a trained policy in a certain object to perform the
same task in a different one. The results of this work show that, given a
policy with high average reward and an accurate dynamic model, the hybrid
framework improves the performance of in-hand manipulation tasks for most test
cases, even when the object properties are changed. However, this improvement
comes at the expense of increasing the computational cost, due to the
complexity of trajectory evaluation.

Conclusion: DeePC为软体机器人的动态控制提供了一种实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Soft robots offer significant advantages in safety and adaptability, yet
achieving precise and dynamic control remains a major challenge due to their
inherently complex and nonlinear dynamics. Recently, Data-enabled Predictive
Control (DeePC) has emerged as a promising model-free approach that bypasses
explicit system identification by directly leveraging input-output data. While
DeePC has shown success in other domains, its application to soft robots
remains underexplored, particularly for three-dimensional (3D) soft robotic
systems. This paper addresses this gap by developing and experimentally
validating an effective DeePC framework on a 3D, cable-driven soft arm.
Specifically, we design and fabricate a soft robotic arm with a thick tubing
backbone for stability, a dense silicone body with large cavities for strength
and flexibility, and rigid endcaps for secure termination. Using this platform,
we implement DeePC with singular value decomposition (SVD)-based dimension
reduction for two key control tasks: fixed-point regulation and trajectory
tracking in 3D space. Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based
controller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,
highlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft
robots.

Abstract: This paper presents the classification of a general quadric into an
axisymmetric quadric (AQ) and the solution to the problem of the proximity of a
given point to an AQ. The problem of proximity in $R^3$ is reduced to the same
in $R^2$, which is not found in the literature. A new method to solve the
problem in $R^2$ is used based on the geometrical properties of the conics,
such as sub-normal, length of the semi-major axis, eccentricity, slope and
radius. Furthermore, the problem in $R^2$ is categorised into two and three
more sub-cases for parabola and ellipse/hyperbola, respectively, depending on
the location of the point, which is a novel approach as per the authors'
knowledge. The proposed method is suitable for implementation in a common
programming language, such as C and proved to be faster than a commercial
library, namely, Bullet.

Abstract: Advances in the control of autonomous systems have accompanied an expansion
in the potential applications for autonomous robotic systems. The success of
applications involving humans depends on the quality of interaction between the
autonomous system and the human supervisor, which is particularly affected by
the degree of trust that the supervisor places in the autonomous system. Absent
from the literature are models of supervisor trust dynamics that can
accommodate asymmetric responses to autonomous system performance and the
intermittent nature of supervisor-autonomous system communication. This paper
focuses on formulating an estimated model of supervisor trust that incorporates
both of these features by employing a switched linear system structure with
event-triggered sampling of the model input and output. Trust response data
collected in a user study with 51 participants were then used identify
parameters for a switched linear model-based observer of supervisor trust.

Conclusion: 多模态世界建模显著提升机器人操作的性能，验证了iMoWM的有效性。

Abstract: Learned world models hold significant potential for robotic manipulation, as
they can serve as simulator for real-world interactions. While extensive
progress has been made in 2D video-based world models, these approaches often
lack geometric and spatial reasoning, which is essential for capturing the
physical structure of the 3D world. To address this limitation, we introduce
iMoWM, a novel interactive world model designed to generate color images, depth
maps, and robot arm masks in an autoregressive manner conditioned on actions.
To overcome the high computational cost associated with three-dimensional
information, we propose MMTokenizer, which unifies multi-modal inputs into a
compact token representation. This design enables iMoWM to leverage large-scale
pretrained VideoGPT models while maintaining high efficiency and incorporating
richer physical information. With its multi-modal representation, iMoWM not
only improves the visual quality of future predictions but also serves as an
effective simulator for model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) and
facilitates real-world imitation learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority of iMoWM across these tasks, showcasing the advantages of
multi-modal world modeling for robotic manipulation. Homepage:

Result: 最佳模型在检测错误和分类连续失败上分别达到93.5%和84.1%的准确率。

Conclusion: 建模人类反应的进展可增强错误检测，并帮助理解人机交互中的连续失败。

Abstract: As robots become more integrated into society, detecting robot errors is
essential for effective human-robot interaction (HRI). When a robot fails
repeatedly, how can it know when to change its behavior? Humans naturally
respond to robot errors through verbal and nonverbal cues that intensify over
successive failures-from confusion and subtle speech changes to visible
frustration and impatience. While prior work shows that human reactions can
indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses
reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize
stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants
interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral
features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.
The best model achieved 93.5% accuracy for detecting errors and 84.1% for
classifying successive failures. Modeling the progression of human reactions
enhances error detection and understanding of repeated interaction breakdowns
in HRI.

Abstract: Visual Teach-and-Repeat Navigation is a direct solution for mobile robot to
be deployed in unknown environments. However, robust trajectory repeat
navigation still remains challenged due to environmental changing and dynamic
objects. In this paper, we propose a novel visual teach-and-repeat navigation
system, which consists of a flexible map representation, robust map matching
and a map-less local navigation module. During the teaching process, the
recorded keyframes are formulated as a topo-metric graph and each node can be
further extended to save new observations. Such representation also alleviates
the requirement of globally consistent mapping. To enhance the place
recognition performance during repeating process, instead of using
frame-to-frame matching, we firstly implement keyframe clustering to aggregate
similar connected keyframes into local map and perform place recognition based
on visual frame-tolocal map matching strategy. To promote the local goal
persistent tracking performance, a long-term goal management algorithm is
constructed, which can avoid the robot getting lost due to environmental
changes or obstacle occlusion. To achieve the goal without map, a local
trajectory-control candidate optimization algorithm is proposed. Extensively
experiments are conducted on our mobile platform. The results demonstrate that
our system is superior to the baselines in terms of robustness and
effectiveness.

Conclusion: 通过超越直接模仿，机器人可以学习到比受限专家演示更优的策略。

Abstract: Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks
using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and
sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's
ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup
restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic
arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional
space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to
suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can
a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained
expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of
expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在未知、结构受限和GPS缺失环境中的导航问题，平衡全局战略与局部战术的冲突。

Result: 在仿真和实际实验中，系统在通信受限和复杂拓扑环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了高效、无死锁的导航，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation in unknown, structurally constrained, and GPS-denied
environments presents a fundamental trade-off between global strategic
foresight and local tactical agility, particularly under limited communication.
Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high
communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the
broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we
propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that
achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified
coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange
lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process
fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient,
trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires
the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a
sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts
by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently
satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive
simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system
significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in
communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.

TL;DR: Flow-Opt是一种基于学习的方法，通过生成模型和安全过滤器提高多机器人轨迹优化的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式多机器人轨迹优化在计算上难以处理大规模群体，Flow-Opt旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用流匹配模型和扩散变换器生成候选轨迹，并通过安全过滤器确保约束满足。

Result: 能够在几十毫秒内生成数十个机器人在复杂环境中的轨迹，速度远超现有方法。

Conclusion: Flow-Opt在计算效率和轨迹多样性方面显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Centralized trajectory optimization in the joint space of multiple robots
allows access to a larger feasible space that can result in smoother
trajectories, especially while planning in tight spaces. Unfortunately, it is
often computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size. In this
paper, we propose Flow-Opt, a learning-based approach towards improving the
computational tractability of centralized multi-robot trajectory optimization.
Specifically, we reduce the problem to first learning a generative model to
sample different candidate trajectories and then using a learned
Safety-Filter(SF) to ensure fast inference-time constraint satisfaction. We
propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with
permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model.
We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that
predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the
SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we
show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered
environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than
existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also
generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing
baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can
be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction
of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach
provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of
trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture
different collision-avoidance behaviors.

TL;DR: 开发了一种轻量化电动假肢手，通过单轴拇指和优化拇指位置实现基本抓握和手内操作，仅需四个电机。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电动假肢手要么电机过多导致笨重，要么机构复杂占用空间大，难以满足日常使用需求。

Method: 结合单轴拇指和优化拇指位置，仅用四个电机实现基本抓握和手内操作（如精确抓握和侧向抓握之间的转换）。

Result: 实验验证显示，对不同宽度（5-30毫米）和形状（圆柱体和棱柱）的物体，重新定向任务的成功率为90-100%。

Conclusion: 该假肢手轻量化（311克），能完成日常任务如盖章、插入USB设备和操作螺丝刀。

Abstract: Electric prosthetic hands should be lightweight to decrease the burden on the
user, shaped like human hands for cosmetic purposes, and have motors inside to
protect them from damage and dirt. In addition to the ability to perform daily
activities, these features are essential for everyday use of the hand. In-hand
manipulation is necessary to perform daily activities such as transitioning
between different postures, particularly through rotational movements, such as
reorienting cards before slot insertion and operating tools such as
screwdrivers. However, currently used electric prosthetic hands only achieve
static grasp postures, and existing manipulation approaches require either many
motors, which makes the prosthesis heavy for daily use in the hand, or complex
mechanisms that demand a large internal space and force external motor
placement, complicating attachment and exposing the components to damage.
Alternatively, we combine a single-axis thumb and optimized thumb positioning
to achieve basic posture and in-hand manipulation, that is, the reorientation
between precision and lateral grasps, using only four motors in a lightweight
(311 g) prosthetic hand. Experimental validation using primitive objects of
various widths (5-30 mm) and shapes (cylinders and prisms) resulted in success
rates of 90-100% for reorientation tasks. The hand performed seal stamping and
USB device insertion, as well as rotation to operate a screwdriver.

Abstract: Seamless loco-manipulation in unstructured environments requires robots to
leverage autonomous exploration alongside whole-body control for physical
interaction. In this work, we introduce HANDO (Hierarchical Autonomous
Navigation and Dexterous Omni-loco-manipulation), a two-layer framework
designed for legged robots equipped with manipulators to perform human-centered
mobile manipulation tasks. The first layer utilizes a goal-conditioned
autonomous exploration policy to guide the robot to semantically specified
targets, such as a black office chair in a dynamic environment. The second
layer employs a unified whole-body loco-manipulation policy to coordinate the
arm and legs for precise interaction tasks-for example, handing a drink to a
person seated on the chair. We have conducted an initial deployment of the
navigation module, and will continue to pursue finer-grained deployment of
whole-body loco-manipulation.

Conclusion: 方法高效支持多模态轨迹生成，适用于不同障碍物和末端执行器几何。

Abstract: Learning-based motion planning can quickly generate near-optimal
trajectories. However, it often requires either large training datasets or
costly collection of human demonstrations. This work proposes an alternative
approach that quickly generates smooth, near-optimal collision-free 3D
Cartesian trajectories from a single artificial demonstration. The
demonstration is encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive (DMP) and iteratively
reshaped using policy-based reinforcement learning to create a diverse
trajectory dataset for varying obstacle configurations. This dataset is used to
train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the
obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and
outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is
validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect
baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory
length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different
obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions. Videos and the implementation

Abstract: Robotics research has made significant strides in learning, yet mastering

Placeit!, an evolutionary-computation framework for generating valid placement

from placing objects on tables to stacking and inserting them. Our experiments
show that by leveraging quality-diversity optimization, Placeit! significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all scenarios for generating
diverse valid poses. A pick&place pipeline built on our framework achieved a
90% success rate over 120 real-world deployments. This work positions Placeit!
as a powerful tool for open-environment pick-and-place tasks and as a valuable
engine for generating the data needed to train simulation-based foundation

Abstract: Ensuring robust robotic navigation in dynamic environments is a key
challenge, as traditional testing methods often struggle to cover the full
spectrum of operational requirements. This paper presents the industrial
adoption of Surrealist, a simulation-based test generation framework originally
for UAVs, now applied to the ANYmal quadrupedal robot for industrial
inspection. Our method uses a search-based algorithm to automatically generate
challenging obstacle avoidance scenarios, uncovering failures often missed by
manual testing. In a pilot phase, generated test suites revealed critical
weaknesses in one experimental algorithm (40.3% success rate) and served as an
effective benchmark to prove the superior robustness of another (71.2% success
rate). The framework was then integrated into the ANYbotics workflow for a
six-month industrial evaluation, where it was used to test five proprietary
algorithms. A formal survey confirmed its value, showing it enhances the
development process, uncovers critical failures, provides objective benchmarks,
and strengthens the overall verification pipeline.

Motivation: 解决生成式模仿学习在未知环境或动作错误下的不安全行为问题，提升机器人任务的安全性。

Method: 利用随机网络蒸馏检测OOD观测，通过动作块熵衡量动作不确定性，结合共形预测校准失败预测分数。

Result: 在五个仿真和真实环境中，FIPER能更准确、更早地预测失败，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FIPER是提升生成式机器人策略可解释性和安全性的重要一步。

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow
matching, has enabled robots to perform complex, long-horizon tasks. However,
distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures
from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier
than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards
more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos

Abstract: Dynamic Scene Graphs (DSGs) provide a structured representation of
hierarchical, interconnected environments, but current approaches struggle to
capture stochastic dynamics, partial observability, and multi-agent activity.
These aspects are critical for embodied AI, where agents must act under
uncertainty and delayed perception. We introduce FOGMACHINE , an open-source
framework that fuses DSGs with discrete-event simulation to model object
dynamics, agent observations, and interactions at scale. This setup enables the
study of uncertainty propagation, planning under limited perception, and
emergent multi-agent behavior. Experiments in urban scenarios illustrate
realistic temporal and spatial patterns while revealing the challenges of
belief estimation under sparse observations. By combining structured
representations with efficient simulation, FOGMACHINE establishes an effective
tool for benchmarking, model training, and advancing embodied AI in complex,

Abstract: In endovascular surgery, endovascular interventionists push a thin tube
called a catheter, guided by a thin wire to a treatment site inside the
patient's blood vessels to treat various conditions such as blood clots,
aneurysms, and malformations. Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance
maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control.
Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome
these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular
navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown
promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning
framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic
contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire
navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different
modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under
simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular
geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the
aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries,

Abstract: Animals achieve energy-efficient locomotion by their implicit passive
dynamics, a marvel that has captivated roboticists for decades.Recently,
methods incorporated Adversarial Motion Prior (AMP) and Reinforcement learning
(RL) shows promising progress to replicate Animals' naturalistic motion.
However, such imitation learning approaches predominantly capture explicit
kinematic patterns, so-called gaits, while overlooking the implicit passive
dynamics. This work bridges this gap by incorporating a reward term guided by
Impact Mitigation Factor (IMF), a physics-informed metric that quantifies a
robot's ability to passively mitigate impacts. By integrating IMF with AMP, our
approach enables RL policies to learn both explicit motion trajectories from
animal reference motion and the implicit passive dynamic. We demonstrate energy
efficiency improvements of up to 32%, as measured by the Cost of Transport
(CoT), across both AMP and handcrafted reward structure.

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unfamiliar environments requires robots to
simultaneously explore, localise, and plan under uncertainty, without relying
on predefined maps or extensive training. We present a biologically inspired,
Active Inference-based framework, Active Inference MAPping and Planning
(AIMAPP). This model unifies mapping, localisation, and decision-making within
a single generative model. Inspired by hippocampal navigation, it uses
topological reasoning, place-cell encoding, and episodic memory to guide
behaviour. The agent builds and updates a sparse topological map online, learns
state transitions dynamically, and plans actions by minimising Expected Free
Energy. This allows it to balance goal-directed and exploratory behaviours. We
implemented a ROS-compatible navigation system that is sensor and
robot-agnostic, capable of integrating with diverse hardware configurations. It
operates in a fully self-supervised manner, is resilient to drift, and supports
both exploration and goal-directed navigation without any pre-training. We
demonstrate robust performance in large-scale real and simulated environments
against state-of-the-art planning models, highlighting the system's
adaptability to ambiguous observations, environmental changes, and sensor
noise. The model offers a biologically inspired, modular solution to scalable,
self-supervised navigation in unstructured settings. AIMAPP is available at
