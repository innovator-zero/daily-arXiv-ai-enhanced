In\ncooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects\nthat are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which\nonly requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact\npoints is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this\nselection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially\nwith the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by\nhow humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose\ncombining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search\nto select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for\ncontact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a\nvariety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes.

Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance\nsafety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we\nintroduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework\ndesigned to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time\nintervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to\nassign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low\nenergy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,\nEBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the\ngradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to\nlow energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in\nreal-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral\ncontrol from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with\nminimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of\nmodels show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially\nlowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H\nbenchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety\nperformance.

Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is intuitive but\noften relies on continuous kinesthetic guidance, which imposes burdens on\noperators. To address these challenges, a contact-informed adaptive\nmotion-planning framework is introduced to infer human intent directly from\nphysical contact and employ the inferred intent for online motion correction in\nHRC. First, an optimization-based force estimation method is proposed to infer\nhuman-intended contact forces and locations from joint torque measurements and\na robot dynamics model, thereby reducing cost and installation complexity while\nenabling whole-body sensitivity.

Comparative experiments with a baseline model-based\ncontroller demonstrate DeePC's superior accuracy, robustness, and adaptability,\nhighlighting its potential as a practical solution for dynamic control of soft\nrobots.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08DeePC\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e0\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7279\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u7cbe\u786e\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6210\u4e3a\u6311\u6218\u3002DeePC\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5236\u9020\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u539a\u7ba1\u9aa8\u67b6\u3001\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u67d4\u6027\u7845\u80f6\u4f53\u548c\u521a\u6027\u7aef\u76d6\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\uff08SVD\uff09\u964d\u7ef4\u7684DeePC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u70b9\u8c03\u8282\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cDeePC\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "DeePC\u4e3a\u8f6f\u4f53\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of\nresection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs\nremains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.\nVisual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and\nsubjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is\ncritical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel\nmethod for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500\nHz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy\npatients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize\nevents extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The\nproposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,\nand artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a\nsensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the\ncontrolled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger\ncorrelation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in\nresected versus non-resected contacts.

We found that representations are partly dense\nrather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence\nand departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an\nimage, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after\nremoving position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond\nlinear sparsity alone.\n  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed\nby combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown\namong colors, fluffy among textures).

To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis\nfrom the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the\nfeatures of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.\nConcretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,\nexhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency\nbands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor\nsimilarity.

Unlike standard\nsupervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning\nfor each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at\ninference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers\nare primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context\nwindow. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical\nstudies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function\nremains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of\nICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel\nequalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient\nattention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,\nleveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.\nFor example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square\n(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for\nenhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term\ntracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for\nnon-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by\nclassical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and\nperformance in dynamic environments.

However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's\nability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup\nrestrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic\narm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional\nspace. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to\nsuboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can\na robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained\nexpert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of\nexpert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories.

While multimodal\nlarge language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and\nsystematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as\nexisting benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or\nspatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive\nand fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied\ncapabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across\n14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory\nunderstanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation\nresults of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across\nall domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose\nBEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision\nmodels to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning\ncapabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse\nembodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative\nimprovement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that\nimproving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated\nenvironments.

Traditional defenses\noften rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial\ntraining or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual\nsystem achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through\nevolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided\nnon-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this\nrobustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework\nincorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,\nsaccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in.

Unfortunately, it is\noften computationally intractable beyond a very small swarm size.

The initialization network is trained\nin a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the\nSF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we\nshow that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered\nenvironments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than\nexisting centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also\ngenerates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing\nbaselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can\nbe batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction\nof a second.

However,\ndistribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can\nstill cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early\nfailure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots\nin human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general\nframework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that\ndoes not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending\nfailure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network\ndistillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in\ngenerated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure\nprediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via\nconformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,\naggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER\nacross five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure\nmodes.

Existing methods typically map 3D\ninstances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for\nclassification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from\n2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during\ninference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we\npropose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided\nKnowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that\nextracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary\nknowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled\n3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding\nnoise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference\nprocess. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP\nembedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint\ndiversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then\ndevelop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D\ninstance.

Existing SOTA\nmethods employ attention-based transformers to learn the 3D hand pose and\nshape, yet they do not fully achieve robust and accurate performance, primarily\ndue to inefficiently modeling spatial relations between joints. To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel graph-guided Mamba framework, named Hamba, which\nbridges graph learning and state space modeling. Our core idea is to\nreformulate Mamba's scanning into graph-guided bidirectional scanning for 3D\nreconstruction using a few effective tokens. This enables us to efficiently\nlearn the spatial relationships between joints for improving reconstruction\nperformance. Specifically, we design a Graph-guided State Space (GSS) block\nthat learns the graph-structured relations and spatial sequences of joints and\nuses 88.5% fewer tokens than attention-based methods. Additionally, we\nintegrate the state space features and the global features using a fusion\nmodule. By utilizing the GSS block and the fusion module, Hamba effectively\nleverages the graph-guided state space features and jointly considers global\nand local features to improve performance. Experiments on several benchmarks\nand in-the-wild tests demonstrate that Hamba significantly outperforms existing\nSOTAs, achieving the PA-MPVPE of 5.3mm and F@15mm of 0.992 on FreiHAND. At the\ntime of this paper's acceptance, Hamba holds the top position, Rank 1 in two\nCompetition Leaderboards on 3D hand reconstruction.

Aerial\ndrone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces\nlimited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,\noccluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail\nto address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that\nreflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,\nenvironments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a\nproblem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these\nunique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data\naugmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in\nconstrained data settings.

To investigate this gap, we\nintroduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.\nEvaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and\ninference-time scaling offers only marginal gains.

Evaluated on\neducational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,\ncuriosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.\nVisualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and\nadaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in\nreal-time learning systems", "AI": {"tldr": "Edu-EmotionNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u7406\u89e3\u5bf9\u63d0\u9ad8\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u548c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u6559\u5b66\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u59cb\u7ec8\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "Edu-EmotionNet\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08CMAA\uff09\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08MIE\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff08TFL\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5171\u4eab\u3001\u6a21\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5728IEMOCAP\u548cMOSEI\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cEdu-EmotionNet\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u6001\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Edu-EmotionNet\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u60c5\u611f\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic\ntextures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is\nwell-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely\nneglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation\nquality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first\nquality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its\nabundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for\ntraining hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by\nhigh- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision\nwithout manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully\ndesigned hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful\nvisual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and\nincorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of\nhand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images\nfrom various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality\nevaluation capability.

Conditions such as\nheavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to\nautomated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity\nmonitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on\nadvanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species\nclassification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to\ndevelop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a\nlimited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new\ndataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.\nCollected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes\nfeatures 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts.

Our bounds provide high-probability\nguarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and\nrepresentational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment\nimproves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch\nsize. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently\nunstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with\ntraining time.\n  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL\nalignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more\nclosely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled\nbridge between self-supervised and supervised learning.

Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage\nefficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of\nstate-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a\ntrade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for\nhigh-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical\nwhen generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often\noccupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct\nthese regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical\ndecision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training\nframework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating\nlesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it\nnot only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of\nlesion delineation.

Previous work\n(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the\ndecision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper\nand lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this\ngap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that\nscales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their\noptimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and\nit remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.\n  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives\nexploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than\noptimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the\nremoval of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without\nexplicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic\ntransitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret\nbounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition\nstructures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).\n  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free\nlearning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in\nFoster et al.

For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we\nredesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from\n$T^{2/3}$ to $\\sqrt{T}$.

This paper proposes a novel\nfrequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a\nsignal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each\narm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to\nthe component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an\nadaptive filter.

However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training\nphase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference\nphase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade\nprediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To\nunlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a\nModel-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores\nof feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,\nthereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final\nprediction.

Reinforcement learning with\nintrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own\nrollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its\nperformance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:\nthe model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased\nand unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,\nwith deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable\ntraining. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\\rho_{\\text{noise}}$,\n$\\rho_{\\text{selfbias}}$, and $\\rho_{\\text{symbias}}$.

As\ninteractions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the\ninterpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes\nincreasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful\nhuman-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations\nof the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge\nin deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of\ninterpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,\ni.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD\nsystems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable\nDriving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric\nvideo dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as\ncausal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived\nfrom both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we\npropose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates\nspatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc\ntechniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the\nDAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater\ninterpretability than conventional CNN-based models.

While existing long-video\nmethods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting\n(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to\nsingle-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive\nmotions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error\naccumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing\nclean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on\nself-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI\nincorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that\nrecycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into\nsupervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct\nits own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors\nthrough closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected\nfeedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to\nintervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow\nmatching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional\nintegration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors\ninto replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new\ninput. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no\nadditional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions\n(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams).

This work presents the first study of unlearning\nunder perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.\nBy systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and\nNPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly\nrobust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To\nexplain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key\nsemantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential\ndespite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning\nalgorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow\nlexical patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5173\u952e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u4f26\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u56e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u800c\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f73\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5148\u8fdb\u7684LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RMU\u548cNPO\uff09\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u8457\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u6838\u5fc3\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u4fdd\u7559\uff1b\u9057\u5fd8\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u6df1\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u7ebf\u7d22\u800c\u975e\u6d45\u5c42\u8bcd\u6c47\u6a21\u5f0f\u9a71\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u4ecd\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated\nAttention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for\nperforming 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle.

Existing sampling strategies\nfor LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or\nexternal keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,\nwhile the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a\nunified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and\nRefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During\ntraining, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated\n\\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token\nsimilarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp\nencodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy\nthat densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential\nframes, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance\ntracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),\nwhich leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask\ninitialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate\naccumulated errors.

However, its vulnerability to\nadversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.\nAlthough existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from\nthree key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial\nattacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)\nthey have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but\ninstead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can\nintroduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack\nof robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent\nGeneral-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel\nrobust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted\nadversary and a robust driving agent.

However, existing\nreasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often\ntreating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce\nBLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging\nperceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require\nmodels to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from\nlanguage-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception\nbenchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception (\"see\") and requires\nfine-grained observation and analytical reasoning (\"observe\"). BLINK-Twice\nintegrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing\nvisual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on\nvisual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of\nthe reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading\nMLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.\nBLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing\nreasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or\nself-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and\nredundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves\nperformance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by\nmodels like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.\nThe dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/PicoTrex/BLINK-Twice", "AI": {"tldr": "BLINK-Twice\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6311\u6218\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u53ef\u66ff\u6362\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u3002BLINK-Twice\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u4ece\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "BLINK-Twice\u5305\u542b\u4e03\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u6311\u6218\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u5bf9\u6297\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8620\u4e2a\u9886\u5148\u7684MLLM\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "BLINK-Twice\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff09\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u91cd\u590d\u56fe\u50cf\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u89c9\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "BLINK-Twice\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5df2\u516c\u5f00\u3002"}}

Nonetheless, its effectiveness\ncritically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,\nachieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene\nstructure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is\noften violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian\nmodels with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and\nartifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in\nincorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded\nor invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply\nclone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of\nreconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose\nVAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban\nscenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based\nvisibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through\ndiversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch\nmatching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction.

Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose\nunderlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks.

This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive\nbecause the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by\nchance.

However, despite this shift, prompt\noptimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt\ncrafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately\nlimiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the\nnew problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior\ndefinition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs\nof textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the\nMultimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs\nthe joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving\nupdates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by\nleveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection\nstrategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go\nbeyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that\nMPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal\nprompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6MPO\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9488\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u65b0\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u5bfc\u5019\u9009\u63d0\u793a\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMPO\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\u975e\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0MLLMs\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

We\nintroduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that\nenables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights\ndirectly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters\non-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each\ndiffusion step based on time and the user's condition.

We also introduce a\nnew ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish\nstandardized evaluation protocols.

This paper\naims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by\ntackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and\nlabor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of\neffective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to\nindividual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that\nintegrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware\nmodeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden\nthe all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using\na task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video\nscenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising\napproximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While\nspecialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for\nevaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by\nmanually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive\ntraining with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the\npotential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a\nspatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses\nscale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,\nextensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,\ndemonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across\nall scales and scenarios.

In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution\ncapability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our\narchitecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token\nand a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs.

Second, we selectively fine-tune the\nlanguage model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to\nintegrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation.

For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a\nnew benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,\nper-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM\nachieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time\nperformance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy\nalso enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,\nimproving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by\n+5.96.

In this\nwork, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a\nconstant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.\nSpecifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a\nDeep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents\nrepresentational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit\nboth the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of\none-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment\nbetween negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or\nnon-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with\nVAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as\na drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.\nEmpirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and\nsubstantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model\nbackbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection.

Accepted at NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential\nprivacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to\ngenerate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in\n$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the\nfundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy\nguarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global\nminimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local\nperspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around\na fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on\nboth $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax\nrisk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class\n$\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,\nwe (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP\nframework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler\nyields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.\nBuilding on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the\nlocally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of\n$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models\nprivate sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is\nrepresented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally\noptimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it\nconsistently outperforms global minimax samplers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\uff08LDP\uff09\u4e0b\u4ece\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u5f3a\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u56fa\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55\u7eafLDP\u5230\u529f\u80fd\u6027LDP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u529f\u80fd\u6027LDP\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u4ecd\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u7531\u5168\u5c40\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u98ce\u9669\u51b3\u5b9a\uff0c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8ef-\u6563\u5ea6\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u79c1\u6709\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u81ea\u7136\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

They\nwork under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to\npre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about\nhow to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the\nhardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base\ngenerative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward\noracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning\nchallenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose\nBaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the\nmodel using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward\nevaluations (NREs).

We then leverage this model to assess whether new\ndata resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from\nthem.
