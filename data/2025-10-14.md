### [1] [TinyViT-Batten: Few-Shot Vision Transformer with Explainable Attention for Early Batten-Disease Detection on Pediatric MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09649)
*Khartik Uppalapati,Bora Yimenicioglu,Shakeel Abdulkareem,Adan Eftekhari,Bhavya Uppalapati,Viraj Kamath*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TinyViT-Batten是一种基于Vision Transformer的少样本学习框架，用于从有限的儿科脑MRI数据中检测早期Batten病，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Batten病的早期MRI迹象难以察觉，需要一种高效且准确的AI解决方案。

Method: 通过蒸馏大型ViT模型为小型TinyViT，并结合少样本学习（原型损失和5-shot episodes）进行微调。

Result: 在79例Batten病MRI和90例对照数据上，模型准确率约91%，ROC曲线下面积≥0.95，敏感性和特异性均约90%。

Conclusion: TinyViT-Batten是一种实用且可解释的AI工具，适用于早期Batten病的检测。

Abstract: Batten disease (neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis) is a rare pediatric
neurodegenerative disorder whose early MRI signs are subtle and often missed.
We propose TinyViT-Batten, a few-shot Vision Transformer (ViT) framework to
detect early Batten disease from pediatric brain MRI with limited training
cases. We distill a large teacher ViT into a 5 M-parameter TinyViT and
fine-tune it using metric-based few-shot learning (prototypical loss with
5-shot episodes). Our model achieves high accuracy (approximately 91%) and area
under ROC of at least 0.95 on a multi-site dataset of 79 genetically confirmed
Batten-disease MRIs (27 CLN3 from the Hochstein natural-history study, 32 CLN2
from an international longitudinal cohort, 12 early-manifestation CLN2 cases
reported by Cokal et al., and 8 public Radiopaedia scans) together with 90
age-matched controls, outperforming a 3D-ResNet and Swin-Tiny baseline. We
further integrate Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to
highlight disease-relevant brain regions, enabling explainable predictions. The
model's small size and strong performance (sensitivity greater than 90%,
specificity approximately 90%) demonstrates a practical AI solution for early
Batten disease detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中数据有限且置信度低，现有方法（如神经网络、决策树）在大数据下表现良好，但小数据场景需改进。

Method: TreeNet结合神经网络、集成学习和树模型的优势，提出分层决策集成学习方法。

Result: 完整训练数据下F1分数0.85，50%数据下0.77，实时处理速度32帧/秒。

Conclusion: TreeNet在医学图像分析中高效且实用，尤其适合实时和小数据场景。

Abstract: Within the domain of medical image analysis, three distinct methodologies
have demonstrated commendable accuracy: Neural Networks, Decision Trees, and
Ensemble-Based Learning Algorithms, particularly in the specialized context of
genstro institutional track abnormalities detection. These approaches exhibit
efficacy in disease detection scenarios where a substantial volume of data is
available. However, the prevalent challenge in medical image analysis pertains
to limited data availability and data confidence. This paper introduces
TreeNet, a novel layered decision ensemble learning methodology tailored for
medical image analysis. Constructed by integrating pivotal features from neural
networks, ensemble learning, and tree-based decision models, TreeNet emerges as
a potent and adaptable model capable of delivering superior performance across
diverse and intricate machine learning tasks. Furthermore, its interpretability
and insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex
medical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics
including Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The
methodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete
training data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\% of the training
data. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\%
of the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology
resulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime
applications. This comprehensive assessment underscores the efficiency and
usability of TreeNet in the demanding landscape of medical image analysis
specially in the realtime analysis.

### [4] [OmniSAT: Compact Action Token, Faster Auto Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09667)
*Huaihai Lyu,Chaofan Chen,Senwei Xie,Pengwei Wang,Xiansheng Chen,Shanghang Zhang,Changsheng Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniSAT通过B-Spline编码和多阶段残差量化，提出了一种高效的动作表示方法，显著缩短训练序列并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AR模型在动作序列压缩中存在重建质量差或效率低的问题，需要一种更高效的表示方法。

Method: 采用B-Spline编码和多阶段残差量化，学习紧凑且可迁移的动作表示，并结合跨体现学习策略。

Result: 训练序列缩短6.8倍，目标熵降低，同时保持重建质量，加速AR训练收敛。

Conclusion: OmniSAT在压缩效率和重建质量上表现优异，适用于大规模预训练和跨体现学习。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models can be broadly categorized into
diffusion-based and auto-regressive (AR) approaches: diffusion models capture
continuous action distributions but rely on computationally heavy iterative
denoising. In contrast, AR models enable efficient optimization and flexible
sequence construction, making them better suited for large-scale pretraining.
To further improve AR efficiency, particularly when action chunks induce
extended and high-dimensional sequences, prior work applies entropy-guided and
token-frequency techniques to shorten the sequence length. However, such
compression struggled with \textit{poor reconstruction or inefficient
compression}. Motivated by this, we introduce an Omni Swift Action Tokenizer,
which learns a compact, transferable action representation. Specifically, we
first normalize value ranges and temporal horizons to obtain a consistent
representation with B-Spline encoding. Then, we apply multi-stage residual
quantization to the position, rotation, and gripper subspaces, producing
compressed discrete tokens with coarse-to-fine granularity for each part. After
pre-training on the large-scale dataset Droid, the resulting discrete
tokenization shortens the training sequence by 6.8$\times$, and lowers the
target entropy. To further explore the potential of OmniSAT, we develop a
cross-embodiment learning strategy that builds on the unified action-pattern
space and jointly leverages robot and human demonstrations. It enables scalable
auxiliary supervision from heterogeneous egocentric videos. Across diverse
real-robot and simulation experiments, OmniSAT encompasses higher compression
while preserving reconstruction quality, enabling faster AR training
convergence and model performance.

### [5] [Knowledge-Aware Mamba for Joint Change Detection and Classification from MODIS Times Series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09679)
*Zhengsen Xu,Yimin Zhu,Zack Dewis,Mabel Heffring,Motasem Alkayid,Saeid Taleghanidoozdoozan,Lincoln Linlin Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KAMamba的新方法，用于改进MODIS时间序列的变化检测，通过知识驱动的过渡矩阵和多任务学习提升准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MODIS时间序列变化检测面临混合像素、时空信息耦合和背景异质性等挑战，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 设计了知识驱动的过渡损失（KAT-loss）、多任务学习框架（PreC-loss、PostC-loss、Chg-loss）、时空Mamba模块（SSTMamba）和稀疏可变形Mamba（SDMamba）骨干网络。

Result: 在加拿大萨斯喀彻温省的MODIS数据集上，变化检测的平均F1值提高了1.5-6%，LULC分类的OA、AA和Kappa指标提升了约2%。

Conclusion: KAMamba通过结合知识驱动和多任务学习，显著提升了MODIS变化检测和分类的性能。

Abstract: Although change detection using MODIS time series is critical for
environmental monitoring, it is a highly challenging task due to key MODIS
difficulties, e.g., mixed pixels, spatial-spectral-temporal information
coupling effect, and background class heterogeneity. This paper presents a
novel knowledge-aware Mamba (KAMamba) for enhanced MODIS change detection, with
the following contributions. First, to leverage knowledge regarding class
transitions, we design a novel knowledge-driven transition-matrix-guided
approach, leading to a knowledge-aware transition loss (KAT-loss) that can
enhance detection accuracies. Second, to improve model constraints, a
multi-task learning approach is designed, where three losses, i.e., pre-change
classification loss (PreC-loss), post-change classification loss (PostC-loss),
and change detection loss (Chg-loss) are used for improve model learning.
Third, to disentangle information coupling in MODIS time series, novel
spatial-spectral-temporal Mamba (SSTMamba) modules are designed. Last, to
improve Mamba model efficiency and remove computational cost, a sparse and
deformable Mamba (SDMamba) backbone is used in SSTMamba. On the MODIS
time-series dataset for Saskatchewan, Canada, we evaluate the method on
land-cover change detection and LULC classification; results show about 1.5-6%
gains in average F1 for change detection over baselines, and about 2%
improvements in OA, AA, and Kappa for LULC classification.

### [6] [NNDM: NN_UNet Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09681)
*Sashank Makanaboyina*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: NNDM结合NN-UNet和扩散模型，提升脑肿瘤MRI分割的边界精度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN模型在泛化性、边界精度和数据多样性方面表现不足。

Method: 提出NNDM框架，通过扩散模型迭代优化NN-UNet生成的分割掩码。

Result: 在BraTS 2021数据集上，NNDM在Dice系数和Hausdorff距离上优于基线模型。

Conclusion: NNDM为确定性分割网络与随机扩散模型的结合提供了新方向。

Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors in magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) are critical for effective diagnosis and treatment planning.
Despite advances in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as U-Net,
existing models often struggle with generalization, boundary precision, and
limited data diversity. To address these challenges, we propose NNDM (NN\_UNet
Diffusion Model)a hybrid framework that integrates the robust feature
extraction of NN-UNet with the generative capabilities of diffusion
probabilistic models. In our approach, the diffusion model progressively
refines the segmentation masks generated by NN-UNet by learning the residual
error distribution between predicted and ground-truth masks. This iterative
denoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies
and enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021
datasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to
conventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in
Dice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided
refinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The
proposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic
segmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of
the art in automated brain tumor analysis.

*Thi Bich Phuong Man,Luu Tu Nguyen,Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的微表情识别方法，通过两种互补表示和自适应融合网络，显著提升了识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情在情感计算、测谎等领域有重要价值，但因其细微和短暂性难以识别。

Method: 提出两种互补表示（时间排序动态图像和运动强度动态图像）和自适应融合网络（AFN）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现优异，CASME-II上达到93.95%准确率，SAMM和MMEW上也表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法为微表情识别提供了新思路，并在实际应用中具有潜力。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are subtle, transient facial changes with very low
intensity, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, yet they reveal a person
genuine emotion. They are of great value in lie detection, behavioral analysis,
and psychological assessment. This paper proposes a novel MER method with two
main contributions. First, we propose two complementary representations -
Temporal-ranked dynamic image, which emphasizes temporal progression, and
Motion-intensity dynamic image, which highlights subtle motions through a frame
reordering mechanism incorporating motion intensity. Second, we propose an
Adaptive fusion network, which automatically learns to optimally integrate
these two representations, thereby enhancing discriminative ME features while
suppressing noise. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (CASME-II, SAMM and
MMEW) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. Specifically, AFN
achieves 93.95 Accuracy and 0.897 UF1 on CASME-II, setting a new
state-of-the-art benchmark. On SAMM, the method attains 82.47 Accuracy and
0.665 UF1, demonstrating more balanced recognition across classes. On MMEW, the
model achieves 76.00 Accuracy, further confirming its generalization ability.
The obtained results show that both the input and the proposed architecture
play important roles in improving the performance of MER. Moreover, they
provide a solid foundation for further research and practical applications in
the fields of affective computing, lie detection, and human-computer
interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇综述首次全面整合了多视角多摄像头（MVMC）的跟踪、重识别（Re-ID）和行为理解（AU），提出了一个统一的框架和分类法，总结了现有方法、数据集和挑战，并展望了未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单视角或孤立任务，缺乏对多摄像头协作和多任务整合的系统性综述，因此需要填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种新的分类法，将CVS分为MVMC跟踪、Re-ID、AU和组合方法四部分，并系统总结了相关数据集、方法和评估指标。

Conclusion: 未来研究应关注CVS的鲁棒性、效率和适应性，以推动智能CVS的发展，本文为相关研究提供了指导和启发。

Abstract: Connected Vision Systems (CVS) are transforming a variety of applications,
including autonomous vehicles, smart cities, surveillance, and human-robot
interaction. These systems harness multi-view multi-camera (MVMC) data to
provide enhanced situational awareness through the integration of MVMC
tracking, re-identification (Re-ID), and action understanding (AU). However,
deploying CVS in real-world, dynamic environments presents a number of
challenges, particularly in addressing occlusions, diverse viewpoints, and
environmental variability. Existing surveys have focused primarily on isolated
tasks such as tracking, Re-ID, and AU, often neglecting their integration into
a cohesive system. These reviews typically emphasize single-view setups,
overlooking the complexities and opportunities provided by multi-camera
collaboration and multi-view data analysis. To the best of our knowledge, this
survey is the first to offer a comprehensive and integrated review of MVMC that
unifies MVMC tracking, Re-ID, and AU into a single framework. We propose a
unique taxonomy to better understand the critical components of CVS, dividing
it into four key parts: MVMC tracking, Re-ID, AU, and combined methods. We
systematically arrange and summarize the state-of-the-art datasets,
methodologies, results, and evaluation metrics, providing a structured view of
the field's progression. Furthermore, we identify and discuss the open research
questions and challenges, along with emerging technologies such as lifelong
learning, privacy, and federated learning, that need to be addressed for future
advancements. The paper concludes by outlining key research directions for
enhancing the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of CVS in complex,
real-world applications. We hope this survey will inspire innovative solutions
and guide future research toward the next generation of intelligent and
adaptive CVS.

### [9] [Constructive Distortion: Improving MLLMs with Attention-Guided Image Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09741)
*Dwip Dalal,Gautam Vashishtha,Utkarsh Mishra,Jeonghwan Kim,Madhav Kanda,Hyeonjeong Ha,Svetlana Lazebnik,Heng Ji,Unnat Jain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttWarp是一种轻量级方法，通过重新分配图像分辨率来提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在细粒度感知任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在复杂场景中容易忽略小细节和空间关系，导致感知错误。

Method: 利用MLLM的跨模态注意力对输入图像进行线性扭曲，重新分配分辨率至模型认为重要的区域，不改变模型权重或架构。

Result: 在五个基准测试和四个MLLM上，AttWarp显著提高了准确性、增强了组合推理能力并减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: 注意力引导的扭曲方法能有效优先处理查询相关信息，同时保留上下文，提升MLLM性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often miss small details and spatial
relations in cluttered scenes, leading to errors in fine-grained perceptual
grounding. We introduce AttWarp, a lightweight method that allocates more
resolution to query-relevant content while compressing less informative areas,
all while preserving global context. At test time, the approach uses an MLLM's
cross-modal attention to perform rectilinear warping of the input image,
reallocating spatial resolution toward regions the model deems important,
without changing model weights or architecture. This attention-guided warping
preserves all original image information but redistributes it non-uniformly, so
small objects and subtle relationships become easier for the same model to read
while the global layout remains intact. Across five benchmarks (TextVQA, GQA,
DocVQA, POPE, MMMU) and four MLLMs (LLaVA, Qwen-VL, InternVL, and
InstructBLIP), AttWarp consistently improves accuracy, strengthens
compositional reasoning, and reduces hallucinations, outperforming four
competitive baselines that manipulate raw images at test time. Together, these
results show that attention-guided warping prioritizes information relevant to
the query while preserving context, and that the same MLLMs perform better when
given such warped inputs.

Motivation: 探索在多模态（图像与文本）情境下，学习者如何推断陌生词汇的意义，并分析影响推断成功的因素。

Method: 通过人类参与者实验，使用不同图像-文本对，分析数据特征（图像和文本）与参与者推断能力的关系。

Result: 发现部分直观特征与参与者表现强相关，AI系统在推理参与者表现方面有改进潜力。

Conclusion: 需进一步研究预测性特征，并提升AI系统在此类任务中的推理能力。

Abstract: We investigate a new setting for foreign language learning, where learners
infer the meaning of unfamiliar words in a multimodal context of a sentence
describing a paired image. We conduct studies with human participants using
different image-text pairs. We analyze the features of the data (i.e., images
and texts) that make it easier for participants to infer the meaning of a
masked or unfamiliar word, and what language backgrounds of the participants
correlate with success. We find only some intuitive features have strong
correlations with participant performance, prompting the need for further
investigating of predictive features for success in these tasks. We also
analyze the ability of AI systems to reason about participant performance, and
discover promising future directions for improving this reasoning ability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种方法，通过分析图像复杂性和VLLM的不确定性方差，确定视觉语言任务的最佳分辨率，并提出了一种参数高效的微调技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉大语言模型（VLLMs）通常假设固定分辨率，导致性能不佳，因此需要研究不同任务的分辨率偏好。

Method: 通过分析图像复杂性和VLLM的不确定性方差，提出经验公式确定最佳分辨率，并开发参数高效的微调技术。

Result: 在多种视觉语言任务上的实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法能够显著提升VLLMs在不同任务中的性能，解决了固定分辨率导致的性能问题。

Abstract: Real-world vision-language applications demand varying levels of perceptual
granularity. However, most existing visual large language models (VLLMs), such
as LLaVA, pre-assume a fixed resolution for downstream tasks, which leads to
subpar performance. To address this problem, we first conduct a comprehensive
and pioneering investigation into the resolution preferences of different
vision-language tasks, revealing a correlation between resolution preferences
with image complexity, and uncertainty variance of the VLLM at different image
input resolutions. Building on this insight, we propose an empirical formula to
determine the optimal resolution for a given vision-language task, combining
these two factors. Second, based on rigorous experiments, we propose a novel
parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique to extend the visual input resolution
of pre-trained VLLMs to the identified optimal resolution. Extensive
experiments on various vision-language tasks validate the effectiveness of our
method.

why they are or are not suitable for our purpose. We evaluated our approach on
two different datasets - Satellite imagery having low quality features and high
quality Aerial photographs. During the study we experimented with various CRFs
to find which CRF gives the best results on images and compared our results on

TL;DR: 研究探讨了合成人脸数据对单形态攻击检测（S-MAD）的增强作用，发现合理使用合成数据可提升泛化能力，但过度依赖会降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因隐私问题导致真实人脸数据不足的局限性。

Method: 采用多种形态工具和跨数据集评估方案，通过增量测试协议评估泛化能力。

Result: 合理控制合成数据量或逐步添加真实数据可提升泛化，但仅用合成数据会导致最高等误率（EER）。

Conclusion: 合成数据需谨慎使用，最佳方案是结合真实数据用于S-MAD。

Abstract: This paper investigates the use of synthetic face data to enhance
Single-Morphing Attack Detection (S-MAD), addressing the limitations of
availability of large-scale datasets of bona fide images due to privacy
concerns. Various morphing tools and cross-dataset evaluation schemes were
utilized to conduct this study. An incremental testing protocol was implemented
to assess the generalization capabilities as more and more synthetic images
were added. The results of the experiments show that generalization can be
improved by carefully incorporating a controlled number of synthetic images
into existing datasets or by gradually adding bona fide images during training.
However, indiscriminate use of synthetic data can lead to sub-optimal
performance. Evenmore, the use of only synthetic data (morphed and non-morphed
images) achieves the highest Equal Error Rate (EER), which means in operational
scenarios the best option is not relying only on synthetic data for S-MAD.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Ceb的新方法，利用细胞边界特征和标签将前景像素聚类为细胞实例，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于像素级目标的方法可能丢失细胞实例的几何特性，如形状和曲率。

Method: Ceb通过改进的Watershed算法提取边界，构建边界特征表示，并使用分类器预测边界标签，最终分割或合并区域。

Result: 在六个数据集上，Ceb优于现有像素聚类方法，并与SOTA方法性能相当。

Conclusion: Ceb通过利用边界特征，显著提升了细胞实例分割的准确性。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for cell instance segmentation are based on
deep learning (DL) semantic segmentation approaches, focusing on distinguishing
foreground pixels from background pixels. In order to identify cell instances
from foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose
instance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to
foreground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the
center point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the
center point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped
polygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric
properties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,
which require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,
we present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),
to leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into
cell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic
segmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries
with a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary
feature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling
pixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the
neighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is
used to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary
signature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging
neighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels. Extensive
experiments on six datasets demonstrate that Ceb outperforms existing pixel
clustering methods on semantic segmentation probability maps. Moreover, Ceb
achieves highly competitive performance compared to SOTA cell instance
segmentation methods.

Conclusion: CAPEL通过保留提示的聚类特性，显著提升了视觉语言模型的零样本迁移能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve zero-shot transfer across
various tasks by pre-training on numerous image-text pairs. These models often
benefit from using an ensemble of context prompts to represent a class. Despite
being effective, conventional prompt ensembling that averages textual features
of context prompts often yields suboptimal results. This is because feature
averaging shifts the class centroids away from the true class distribution. To
address this issue, we propose the Cluster-Aware Prompt Ensemble Learning
(CAPEL) framework, which preserves the cluster nature of context prompts. CAPEL
classifies images into one of several class clusters, each represented by a
distinct prompt. Instead of ensembling prompts in the feature space, we perform
ensembling in the classification logits space, aligning better with the visual
feature distribution. To further optimize prompt fine-tuning while maintaining
cluster-specific discriminative power, we introduce a cluster-preserving
regularization term. This ensures that prompts remain distinct and specialized
for different clusters, preventing collapse into a uniform direction.
Additionally, we integrate an adaptive prompt weighting technique to
dynamically adjust the attention weights for flawed or ambiguous prompts,
ensuring robust performance across diverse datasets and tasks.

*Milad Khanchi,Maria Amer,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多目标跟踪方法，通过融合深度和掩码特征，使用自监督编码器生成稳定的对象表示，避免了计算分割IoU的高开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MOT方法依赖IoU进行关联，但在对象相似或遮挡时不可靠，且计算分割IoU开销大。

Method: 融合深度和掩码特征，通过自监督编码器生成对象表示，结合边界框IoU和重识别特征进行匹配。

Result: 在复杂场景（如SportsMOT和DanceTrack）中优于现有TBD方法，在简单场景（如MOT17）中表现竞争性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督编码器优化分割掩码，提升了MOT性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union
(IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are
similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is
computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture
object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth
and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained
self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we
use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and
re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot
depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to
obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the
self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks
IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and
tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more
efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with
non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and
DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most
metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with
linear motion, such as MOT17.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有HDR-VQA数据集主要针对专业生成内容，缺乏对真实世界UGC-HDR视频质量的研究。

Method: 通过Amazon Mechanical Turk收集856个UGC-HDR源视频的211,848个主观评分，模拟真实场景。

Result: CHUG提供了5,992个视频的基准数据集，支持分析UGC特有的HDR视频失真。

Conclusion: CHUG将推动无参考HDR-VQA研究，数据集已公开。

Abstract: High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos enhance visual experiences with superior
brightness, contrast, and color depth. The surge of User-Generated Content
(UGC) on platforms like YouTube and TikTok introduces unique challenges for HDR
video quality assessment (VQA) due to diverse capture conditions, editing
artifacts, and compression distortions. Existing HDR-VQA datasets primarily
focus on professionally generated content (PGC), leaving a gap in understanding
real-world UGC-HDR degradations. To address this, we introduce CHUG:
Crowdsourced User-Generated HDR Video Quality Dataset, the first large-scale
subjective study on UGC-HDR quality. CHUG comprises 856 UGC-HDR source videos,
transcoded across multiple resolutions and bitrates to simulate real-world
scenarios, totaling 5,992 videos. A large-scale study via Amazon Mechanical
Turk collected 211,848 perceptual ratings. CHUG provides a benchmark for
analyzing UGC-specific distortions in HDR videos. We anticipate CHUG will
advance No-Reference (NR) HDR-VQA research by offering a large-scale, diverse,
and real-world UGC dataset. The dataset is publicly available at:

Motivation: 室内场景布局复杂且不规则，传统均匀基布置方法效率低，需优化资源利用。

Method: 利用几何先验指导基的最优布置，并提出自适应虚拟视点补偿几何缺陷。

Result: 在大规模室内场景中，渲染质量和内存需求显著优于均匀布置基线。

Conclusion: 场景自适应策略有效提升NeRF在复杂室内场景中的表现。

Abstract: We propose scene-adaptive strategies to efficiently allocate representation
capacity for generating immersive experiences of indoor environments from
incomplete observations. Indoor scenes with multiple rooms often exhibit
irregular layouts with varying complexity, containing clutter, occlusion, and
flat walls. We maximize the utilization of limited resources with guidance from
geometric priors, which are often readily available after pre-processing
stages. We record observation statistics on the estimated geometric scaffold
and guide the optimal placement of bases, which greatly improves upon the
uniform basis arrangements adopted by previous scalable Neural Radiance Field
(NeRF) representations. We also suggest scene-adaptive virtual viewpoints to
compensate for geometric deficiencies inherent in view configurations in the
input trajectory and impose the necessary regularization. We present a
comprehensive analysis and discussion regarding rendering quality and memory
requirements in several large-scale indoor scenes, demonstrating significant
enhancements compared to baselines that employ regular placements.

Motivation: 解决日常环境中因频繁变化导致的稀疏视角重建挑战。

Method: 通过模板高斯建模和细化管道，适应时间变化的环境。

Result: 在重建质量和轻量更新方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LTGS框架在稀疏捕获下实现了高质量的长期场景重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic
visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures.
However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges
due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially
and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view
updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace
everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an
incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an
initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the
scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We
construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable
priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further
refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying
environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is
generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations,
significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D
environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term
real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets
to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our
framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines
while enabling fast and light-weight updates.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角姿态估计框架，结合训练、后处理技术和模型蒸馏，显著提升了有限标注数据下的准确性和不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在有限标注数据和不确定性估计上的不足，以支持科学研究的动物行为量化。

Method: 结合多视角Transformer（MVT）、几何一致性增强、改进的Ensemble Kalman Smoother（EKS）后处理及模型蒸馏技术。

Result: 在三种动物（苍蝇、小鼠、山雀）上表现优于现有方法，实现了高效且不确定性感知的姿态估计。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际应用提供了可靠的多视角姿态估计系统，支持下游行为分析。

Abstract: Multi-view pose estimation is essential for quantifying animal behavior in
scientific research, yet current methods struggle to achieve accurate tracking
with limited labeled data and suffer from poor uncertainty estimates. We
address these challenges with a comprehensive framework combining novel
training and post-processing techniques, and a model distillation procedure
that leverages the strengths of these techniques to produce a more efficient
and effective pose estimator. Our multi-view transformer (MVT) utilizes
pretrained backbones and enables simultaneous processing of information across
all views, while a novel patch masking scheme learns robust cross-view
correspondences without camera calibration. For calibrated setups, we
incorporate geometric consistency through 3D augmentation and a triangulation
loss. We extend the existing Ensemble Kalman Smoother (EKS) post-processor to
the nonlinear case and enhance uncertainty quantification via a variance
inflation technique. Finally, to leverage the scaling properties of the MVT, we
design a distillation procedure that exploits improved EKS predictions and
uncertainty estimates to generate high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby reducing
dependence on manual labels. Our framework components consistently outperform
existing methods across three diverse animal species (flies, mice, chickadees),
with each component contributing complementary benefits. The result is a
practical, uncertainty-aware system for reliable pose estimation that enables
downstream behavioral analyses under real-world data constraints.

Abstract: The relevance of this research lies in the growing demand for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) capable of operating reliably in complex environments where
conventional navigation becomes unreliable due to interference, poor
visibility, or camouflage. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) provides unique
opportunities for UAV-based computer vision by enabling fine-grained material
recognition and object differentiation, which are critical for navigation,
surveillance, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. The aim of this work
is to develop a deep learning architecture integrating HSI into UAV perception
for navigation, object detection, and terrain classification. Objectives
include: reviewing existing HSI methods, designing a hybrid 2D/3D convolutional
architecture with spectral-spatial cross-attention, training, and benchmarking.
The methodology is based on the modification of the Mobile 3D Vision
Transformer (MDvT) by introducing the proposed SpectralCA block. This block
employs bi-directional cross-attention to fuse spectral and spatial features,
enhancing accuracy while reducing parameters and inference time. Experimental
evaluation was conducted on the WHU-Hi-HongHu dataset, with results assessed
using Overall Accuracy, Average Accuracy, and the Kappa coefficient. The
findings confirm that the proposed architecture improves UAV perception
efficiency, enabling real-time operation for navigation, object recognition,
and environmental monitoring tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像超分辨率技术分别处理面部和背景区域，导致边界伪影，而人类感知对面部保真度特别敏感。

Method: 基于单步扩散模型，引入面部监督机制和参考机制，专注于面部区域并减少低质量恢复中的模糊问题。

Result: HeadsUp在肖像图像超分辨率任务中表现优异，同时在通用图像和对齐面部数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: HeadsUp通过端到端方式解决了肖像图像超分辨率问题，并建立了高质量数据集PortraitSR-4K支持训练和评估。

Abstract: Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural
backgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social
media. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either
on generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face
super-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait
photos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general
model processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably
introduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to
different model training recipes, while human perception is particularly
sensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the
portrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a
single-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and
upscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our
model on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision
mechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region. We then
integrate a reference-based mechanism to help with identity restoration,
reducing face ambiguity in low-quality face restoration. Additionally, we have
built a high-quality 4K portrait image ISR dataset dubbed PortraitSR-4K, to
support model training and benchmarking for portrait images. Extensive
experiments show that HeadsUp achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
PortraitISR task while maintaining comparable or higher performance on both
general image and aligned face datasets.

Conclusion: 提出的方法有望克服现有水下图像数据集的局限性，推动海洋研究的发展。

Abstract: Underwater images play a crucial role in ocean research and marine
environmental monitoring since they provide quality information about the
ecosystem. However, the complex and remote nature of the environment results in
poor image quality with issues such as low visibility, blurry textures, color
distortion, and noise. In recent years, research in image enhancement has
proven to be effective but also presents its own limitations, like poor
generalization and heavy reliance on clean datasets. One of the challenges
herein is the lack of diversity and the low quality of images included in these
datasets. Also, most existing datasets consist only of monocular images, a fact
that limits the representation of different lighting conditions and angles. In
this paper, we propose a new plan of action to overcome these limitations. On
one hand, we call for expanding the datasets using a denoising diffusion model
to include a variety of image types such as stereo, wide-angled, macro, and
close-up images. On the other hand, we recommend enhancing the images using
Controlnet to evaluate and increase the quality of the corresponding datasets,
and hence improve the study of the marine ecosystem.

<details>

Motivation: 人脑在生命周期中经历动态的结构变化，但现有方法难以处理离散且采样不规则的纵向MRI数据。

Method: 使用INR将纵向T1加权MRI数据建模为连续函数，并设计新架构部分解耦时空参数。

Result: 在模拟数据上，INR方法对脑衰老轨迹分类的准确率达81.3%，优于基线模型（73.7%）。

Conclusion: INR能有效表征脑部连续衰老过程，为不规则采样数据的分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: The human brain undergoes dynamic, potentially pathology-driven, structural
changes throughout a lifespan. Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
and other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of
change associated with typical and atypical aging. However, the analysis of
such data is highly challenging given their discrete nature with different
spatial and temporal image sampling patterns within individuals and across
populations. This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep
learning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological
process. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven
method for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling
subject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions
using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel
INR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal
trajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates
on the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate
our method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded
trajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and
dementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints. In the
more realistic irregular sampling experiment, our INR-based method achieves
81.3% accuracy for the brain aging trajectory classification task,
outperforming a standard deep learning baseline model (73.7%).

Conclusion: 该框架为构建准确、鲁棒且适应真实场景的分割系统提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Segmentation models achieve high accuracy on benchmarks but often fail in
real-world domains by relying on spurious correlations instead of true object
boundaries. We propose a human-in-the-loop interactive framework that enables
interventional learning through targeted human corrections of segmentation
outputs. Our approach treats human corrections as interventional signals that
show when reliance on superficial features (e.g., color or texture) is
inappropriate. The system learns from these interventions by propagating
correction-informed edits across visually similar images, effectively steering
the model toward robust, semantically meaningful features rather than
dataset-specific artifacts. Unlike traditional annotation approaches that
simply provide more training data, our method explicitly identifies when and
why the model fails and then systematically corrects these failure modes across
the entire dataset. Through iterative human feedback, the system develops
increasingly robust representations that generalize better to novel domains and
resist artifactual correlations. We demonstrate that our framework improves
segmentation accuracy by up to 9 mIoU points (12-15\% relative improvement) on
challenging cubemap data and yields 3-4$\times$ reductions in annotation effort
compared to standard retraining, while maintaining competitive performance on
benchmark datasets. This work provides a practical framework for researchers
and practitioners seeking to build segmentation systems that are accurate,
robust to dataset biases, data-efficient, and adaptable to real-world domains
such as urban climate monitoring and autonomous driving.

Abstract: As a specialty agricultural product with a large market scale, Shatian pomelo
necessitates the adoption of automated detection to ensure accurate quantity
and meet commercial demands for lean production. Existing research often
involves specialized networks tailored for specific theoretical or dataset
scenarios, but these methods tend to degrade performance in real-world. Through
analysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges
that affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting
conditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these
challenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to
effectively solve tone variation introduced by diverse imaging devices and
complex orchard environments, we utilize a multi-scenario dataset,
STP-AgriData, which is constructed by integrating real orchard images with
internet-sourced data. Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination
conditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing
brightness, are applied to the above dataset. Thirdly, to address the issues of
object scale variation and occlusion in fruit detection, an REAS-Det network is
designed in this paper. For scale variation, RFAConv and C3RFEM modules are
designed to expand and enhance the receptive fields. For occlusion variation, a
multi-scale, multi-head feature selection structure (MultiSEAM) and soft-NMS
are introduced to enhance the handling of occlusion issues to improve detection
accuracy. The results of these experiments achieved a precision(P) of 87.6%, a
recall (R) of 74.9%, a mAP@.50 of 82.8%, and a mAP@.50:.95 of 53.3%. Our
proposed network demonstrates superior performance compared to other
state-of-the-art detection methods.

Abstract: Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions,
is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning,
and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare
professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and
prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial
intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these
limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require
large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently
struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient
variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint
Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided
image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model.
Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage
retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the
retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual
similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes
meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the
overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple
segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two
benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For
example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice
score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of
1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to
a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These
results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across
architectures and datasets.

Abstract: Accurate, scalable traffic monitoring is critical for real-time and long-term
transportation management, particularly during disruptions such as natural
disasters, large construction projects, or major policy changes like New York
City's first-in-the-nation congestion pricing program. However, widespread
sensor deployment remains limited due to high installation, maintenance, and
data management costs. While traffic cameras offer a cost-effective
alternative, existing video analytics struggle with dynamic camera viewpoints
and massive data volumes from large camera networks. This study presents an
end-to-end AI-based framework leveraging existing traffic camera infrastructure
for high-resolution, longitudinal analysis at scale. A fine-tuned YOLOv11
model, trained on localized urban scenes, extracts multimodal traffic density
and classification metrics in real time. To address inconsistencies from
non-stationary pan-tilt-zoom cameras, we introduce a novel graph-based
viewpoint normalization method. A domain-specific large language model was also
integrated to process massive data from a 24/7 video stream to generate
frequent, automated summaries of evolving traffic patterns, a task far
exceeding manual capabilities. We validated the system using over 9 million
images from roughly 1,000 traffic cameras during the early rollout of NYC
congestion pricing in 2025. Results show a 9% decline in weekday passenger
vehicle density within the Congestion Relief Zone, early truck volume
reductions with signs of rebound, and consistent increases in pedestrian and
cyclist activity at corridor and zonal scales. Experiments showed that
example-based prompts improved LLM's numerical accuracy and reduced
hallucinations. These findings demonstrate the framework's potential as a
practical, infrastructure-ready solution for large-scale, policy-relevant
traffic monitoring with minimal human intervention.

Abstract: Lens flare occurs when shooting towards strong light sources, significantly
degrading the visual quality of images. Due to the difficulty in capturing
flare-corrupted and flare-free image pairs in the real world, existing datasets
are typically synthesized in 2D by overlaying artificial flare templates onto
background images. However, the lack of flare diversity in templates and the
neglect of physical principles in the synthesis process hinder models trained
on these datasets from generalizing well to real-world scenarios. To address
these challenges, we propose a new physics-informed method for flare data
generation, which consists of three stages: parameterized template creation,
the laws of illumination-aware 2D synthesis, and physical engine-based 3D
rendering, which finally gives us a mixed flare dataset that incorporates both
2D and 3D perspectives, namely FlareX. This dataset offers 9,500 2D templates
derived from 95 flare patterns and 3,000 flare image pairs rendered from 60 3D
scenes. Furthermore, we design a masking approach to obtain real-world
flare-free images from their corrupted counterparts to measure the performance
of the model on real-world images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method and dataset.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了BurstDeflicker基准数据集，用于解决短曝光图像中的闪烁问题，通过合成、真实采集和动态场景三种方法构建数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短曝光图像中的闪烁问题影响图像质量和高层任务，但缺乏大规模真实数据集阻碍了研究进展。

Method: 采用Retinex合成、真实场景采集和绿屏动态场景三种互补策略构建数据集。

Result: 实验证明数据集有效，能推动闪烁去除研究。

Conclusion: BurstDeflicker数据集为闪烁去除研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Flicker artifacts in short-exposure images are caused by the interplay
between the row-wise exposure mechanism of rolling shutter cameras and the
temporal intensity variations of alternating current (AC)-powered lighting.
These artifacts typically appear as uneven brightness distribution across the
image, forming noticeable dark bands. Beyond compromising image quality, this
structured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and
tracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of
flicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant
barrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we
present BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three
complementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based
synthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables
controllable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,
area, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker
patterns. Second, we capture 4,000 real-world flicker images from different
scenes, which help the model better understand the spatial and temporal
characteristics of real flicker artifacts and generalize more effectively to
wild scenarios. Finally, due to the non-repeatable nature of dynamic scenes, we
propose a green-screen method to incorporate motion into image pairs while
preserving real flicker degradation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our dataset and its potential to advance research in flicker
removal.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型仅依赖文本指令输入和文本输出，缺乏对图像中视觉线索的直接理解以及与图像关键区域的连接。

Method: 提出MIMO模型，结合视觉线索和文本指令理解复杂医学图像和语义，并通过MIMOSeg数据集（包含895K样本）解决医学领域数据稀缺问题。

Result: 实验证明MIMO能够结合视觉参考和像素接地能力，这在之前的模型中无法实现。

Conclusion: MIMO模型在医学多模态任务中表现出色，填补了现有模型的不足。

Abstract: Currently, medical vision language models are widely used in medical vision
question answering tasks. However, existing models are confronted with two
issues: for input, the model only relies on text instructions and lacks direct
understanding of visual clues in the image; for output, the model only gives
text answers and lacks connection with key areas in the image. To address these
issues, we propose a unified medical vision language model MIMO, with visual
referring Multimodal Input and pixel grounding Multimodal Output. MIMO can not
only combine visual clues and textual instructions to understand complex
medical images and semantics, but can also ground medical terminologies in
textual output within the image. To overcome the scarcity of relevant data in
the medical field, we propose MIMOSeg, a comprehensive medical multimodal
dataset including 895K samples. MIMOSeg is constructed from four different
perspectives, covering basic instruction following and complex question
answering with multimodal input and multimodal output. We conduct experiments
on several downstream medical multimodal tasks. Extensive experimental results
verify that MIMO can uniquely combine visual referring and pixel grounding
capabilities, which are not available in previous models.

TL;DR: Q-Adapter是一种轻量级视觉适配器模块，用于高效微调多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频字幕任务，在参数效率与性能间取得平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调（PEFT）方法主要关注语言组件，对多模态任务中的视觉信息理解不足，Q-Adapter旨在填补这一空白。

Method: Q-Adapter在视觉编码器中引入可学习查询令牌和门控层，无需外部文本监督即可提取稀疏且与字幕相关的特征。

Result: 在MSR-VTT和MSVD数据集上，Q-Adapter在PEFT方法中达到SOTA性能，且仅需1.4%参数即可媲美全微调方法。

Conclusion: Q-Adapter展示了在视频语言建模中平衡字幕质量与参数效率的潜力，为适配器学习提供了优化策略的见解。

Abstract: Recent advances in video captioning are driven by large-scale pretrained
models, which follow the standard "pre-training followed by fine-tuning"
paradigm, where the full model is fine-tuned for downstream tasks. Although
effective, this approach becomes computationally prohibitive as the model size
increases. The Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approach offers a
promising alternative, but primarily focuses on the language components of
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Despite recent progress, PEFT remains
underexplored in multimodal tasks and lacks sufficient understanding of visual
information during fine-tuning the model. To bridge this gap, we propose
Query-Adapter (Q-Adapter), a lightweight visual adapter module designed to
enhance MLLMs by enabling efficient fine-tuning for the video captioning task.
Q-Adapter introduces learnable query tokens and a gating layer into Vision
Encoder, enabling effective extraction of sparse, caption-relevant features
without relying on external textual supervision. We evaluate Q-Adapter on two
well-known video captioning datasets, MSR-VTT and MSVD, where it achieves
state-of-the-art performance among the methods that take the PEFT approach
across BLEU@4, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and CIDEr metrics. Q-Adapter also achieves
competitive performance compared to methods that take the full fine-tuning
approach while requiring only 1.4% of the parameters. We further analyze the
impact of key hyperparameters and design choices on fine-tuning effectiveness,
providing insights into optimization strategies for adapter-based learning.
These results highlight the strong potential of Q-Adapter in balancing caption
quality and parameter efficiency, demonstrating its scalability for
video-language modeling.

TL;DR: P-4DGS提出了一种动态3D高斯泼溅表示方法，通过时空预测和量化压缩技术显著降低了内存消耗，同时保持了高质量重建和实时渲染性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态3DGS算法忽略了动态场景中的时空冗余，导致内存消耗过高。

Method: 设计了基于3D锚点的时空预测模块，并结合自适应量化和熵编码技术。

Result: 在合成和真实场景中分别实现了40倍和90倍的压缩，存储占用低至1MB，同时保持最佳重建质量和最快渲染速度。

Conclusion: P-4DGS在压缩效率和性能上均优于现有方法，适用于高效4D场景建模。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention due to its
superior scene representation fidelity and real-time rendering performance,
especially for dynamic 3D scene reconstruction (\textit{i.e.}, 4D
reconstruction). However, despite achieving promising results, most existing
algorithms overlook the substantial temporal and spatial redundancies inherent
in dynamic scenes, leading to prohibitive memory consumption. To address this,
we propose P-4DGS, a novel dynamic 3DGS representation for compact 4D scene
modeling. Inspired by intra- and inter-frame prediction techniques commonly
used in video compression, we first design a 3D anchor point-based
spatial-temporal prediction module to fully exploit the spatial-temporal
correlations across different 3D Gaussian primitives. Subsequently, we employ
an adaptive quantization strategy combined with context-based entropy coding to
further reduce the size of the 3D anchor points, thereby achieving enhanced
compression efficiency. To evaluate the rate-distortion performance of our
proposed P-4DGS in comparison with other dynamic 3DGS representations, we
conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art
reconstruction quality and the fastest rendering speed, with a remarkably low
storage footprint (around \textbf{1MB} on average), achieving up to
\textbf{40$\times$} and \textbf{90$\times$} compression on synthetic and
real-world scenes, respectively.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法受限于局部感受野，而Transformer方法在多模态系数和时序动态提取上表现不足。

Method: 提出CCFormer框架，包括早期集成模块（EIM）、多查询Transformer模块（MTM）和双模态对比学习（BCL）。

Result: 在S4、MS3和AVSS数据集上达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: CCFormer通过结合局部与全局信息及时空上下文，显著提升了音频-视觉分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to generate pixel-wise segmentation maps
that correlate with the auditory signals of objects. This field has seen
significant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing
the segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage
audio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and
multiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More
recently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing
attention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.
Nevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and
temporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the
Complementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept
at processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal
context comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration
Module (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging
multi-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal
complementarity. To extract the intra-frame spatial features and facilitate the
perception of temporal coherence, we introduce the Multi-query Transformer
Module (MTM), which dynamically endows audio queries with learning capabilities
and models the frame and video-level relations simultaneously. Furthermore, we
propose the Bi-modal Contrastive Learning (BCL) to promote the alignment across
both modalities in the unified feature space. Through the effective combination
of those designs, our method sets new state-of-the-art benchmarks across the
S4, MS3 and AVSS datasets. Our source code and model weights will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/SitongGong/CCFormer

<details>

Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型通常依赖单次推理，忽略了局部视觉线索，而人类专家会迭代扫描和聚焦关键区域。

Method: ViTAR采用“思考-行动-再思考-回答”的认知链，结合两阶段训练策略（监督微调和强化学习）。

Result: ViTAR在性能上超越现有模型，视觉注意力分析显示其能聚焦临床关键区域。

Conclusion: 嵌入专家式迭代思维链可提升医学AI的性能和可信度。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image-text understanding but
typically rely on a single-pass reasoning that neglects localized visual cues.
In clinical practice, however, human experts iteratively scan, focus, and
refine the regions of interest before reaching a final diagnosis. To narrow
this machine-human perception gap, we introduce ViTAR, a novel VLM framework
that emulates the iterative reasoning process of human experts through a
cognitive chain of "think-act-rethink-answer". ViTAR treats medical images as
interactive objects, enabling models to engage multi-step visual reasoning. To
support this approach, we curate a high-quality instruction dataset comprising
1K interactive examples that encode expert-like diagnostic behaviors. In
addition, a 16K visual question answering training data has been curated
towards fine-grained visual diagnosis. We introduce a two-stage training
strategy that begins with supervised fine-tuning to guide cognitive
trajectories, followed by the reinforcement learning to optimize
decision-making. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ViTAR outperforms
strong state-of-the-art models. Visual attention analysis reveals that from the
"think" to "rethink" rounds, ViTAR increasingly anchors visual grounding to
clinically critical regions and maintains high attention allocation to visual
tokens during reasoning, providing mechanistic insight into its improved
performance. These findings demonstrate that embedding expert-style iterative
thinking chains into VLMs enhances both performance and trustworthiness of
medical AI.

Abstract: Deep learning based face-swap videos, widely known as deepfakes, have drawn
wide attention due to their threat to information credibility. Recent works
mainly focus on the problem of deepfake detection that aims to reliably tell
deepfakes apart from real ones, in an objective way. On the other hand, the
subjective perception of deepfakes, especially its computational modeling and
imitation, is also a significant problem but lacks adequate study. In this
paper, we focus on the visual realism assessment of deepfakes, which is defined
as the automatic assessment of deepfake visual realism that approximates human
perception of deepfakes. It is important for evaluating the quality and
deceptiveness of deepfakes which can be used for predicting the influence of
deepfakes on Internet, and it also has potentials in improving the deepfake
generation process by serving as a critic. This paper prompts this new
direction by presenting a comprehensive benchmark called DREAM, which stands
for Deepfake REalism AssessMent. It is comprised of a deepfake video dataset of
diverse quality, a large scale annotation that includes 140,000 realism scores
and textual descriptions obtained from 3,500 human annotators, and a
comprehensive evaluation and analysis of 16 representative realism assessment
methods, including recent large vision language model based methods and a newly
proposed description-aligned CLIP method. The benchmark and insights included
in this study can lay the foundation for future research in this direction and
other related areas.

Conclusion: CLSL通过联合学习语义感知特征和标签恢复，有效解决了多标签图像识别中标签不完整的问题，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels is a critical learning
task and has emerged as a focal topic in computer vision. However, this task is
confronted with two core challenges: semantic-aware feature learning and
missing label recovery. In this paper, we propose a novel Collaborative
Learning of Semantic-aware feature learning and Label recovery (CLSL) method
for multi-label image recognition with incomplete labels, which unifies the two
aforementioned challenges into a unified learning framework. More specifically,
we design a semantic-related feature learning module to learn robust
semantic-related features by discovering semantic information and label
correlations. Then, a semantic-guided feature enhancement module is proposed to
generate high-quality discriminative semantic-aware features by effectively
aligning visual and semantic feature spaces. Finally, we introduce a
collaborative learning framework that integrates semantic-aware feature
learning and label recovery, which can not only dynamically enhance the
discriminability of semantic-aware features but also adaptively infer and
recover missing labels, forming a mutually reinforced loop between the two
processes. Extensive experiments on three widely used public datasets (MS-COCO,
VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) demonstrate that CLSL outperforms the state-of-the-art
multi-label image recognition methods with incomplete labels.

Conclusion: PHG-MAE在多模态任务中具有潜力，适用于自动驾驶等类似领域。

Abstract: The computer vision domain has greatly benefited from an abundance of data
across many modalities to improve on various visual tasks. Recently, there has
been a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked
Autoencoders (MAE) \cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a
first step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or
regression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled
data. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked
Autoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural
graphs \cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders
under a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire
modalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of
hyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard
MAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training
loop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles
which, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and
consistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of
the ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer
than 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that
contain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be
followed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor
robotics. In order to streamline the process of integrating external
pre-trained experts for computer vision multi-modal multi-task learning (MTL)
scenarios, we developed a data-pipeline software. Using this tool, we have
created and released a fully-automated extension of the Dronescapes dataset.
All the technical details, code and reproduction steps are publicly released.

Result: 在巴格滑坡和色拉滑坡案例中验证了框架的有效性，成功捕捉到滑坡前兆和后期演化。

Conclusion: 该框架能连续追踪滑坡疤痕，为早期预警和长期稳定性评估提供关键信息。

Abstract: Tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars is
critical for understanding the evolution mechanisms and failure precursors,
enabling effective early-warning. However, most existing studies have focused
on single-phase or pre- and post-failure dual-phase landslide identification.
Although these approaches delineate post-failure landslide boundaries, it is
challenging to track the spatiotemporal evolution of landslide scars. To
address this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for
tracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a
vision foundation model. The key idea behind the proposed framework is to
reconstruct discrete optical remote sensing images into a continuous video
sequence. This transformation enables a vision foundation model, which is
developed for video segmentation, to be used for tracking the evolution of
landslide scars. The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,
auto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous
and accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was
validated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure
Baige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025). Results indicate
that the proposed framework enables continuous tracking of landslide scars,
capturing both failure precursors critical for early warning and post-failure
evolution essential for assessing secondary hazards and long-term stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF和3DGS依赖准确的相机姿态和密集视角覆盖，限制了在稀疏视角下的应用。Gesplat旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 1) 混合高斯表示与双位置形状优化；2) 图引导属性细化模块；3) 基于流的深度正则化。

Result: 在正向和大规模复杂数据集上表现优于其他无姿态方法。

Conclusion: Gesplat在稀疏视角下实现了更稳健的性能和几何一致性。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have advanced
3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis, but remain heavily dependent on
accurate camera poses and dense viewpoint coverage. These requirements limit
their applicability in sparse-view settings, where pose estimation becomes
unreliable and supervision is insufficient. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Gesplat, a 3DGS-based framework that enables robust novel view
synthesis and geometrically consistent reconstruction from unposed sparse
images. Unlike prior works that rely on COLMAP for sparse point cloud
initialization, we leverage the VGGT foundation model to obtain more reliable
initial poses and dense point clouds. Our approach integrates several key
innovations: 1) a hybrid Gaussian representation with dual position-shape
optimization enhanced by inter-view matching consistency; 2) a graph-guided
attribute refinement module to enhance scene details; and 3) flow-based depth
regularization that improves depth estimation accuracy for more effective
supervision. Comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that our approach achieves more robust performance on both forward-facing and
large-scale complex datasets compared to other pose-free methods.

Result: 实验表明FedCoPL优于基线方法。

Conclusion: FedCoPL为UFL在分类问题中的应用提供了新思路，展示了其高效协作与个性化能力。

Abstract: Unsupervised Federated Learning (UFL) aims to collaboratively train a global
model across distributed clients without sharing data or accessing label
information. Previous UFL works have predominantly focused on representation
learning and clustering tasks. Recently, vision language models (e.g., CLIP)
have gained significant attention for their powerful zero-shot prediction
capabilities. Leveraging this advancement, classification problems that were
previously infeasible under the UFL paradigm now present promising new
opportunities, yet remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we extend UFL to
the classification problem with CLIP for the first time and propose a novel
method, \underline{\textbf{Fed}}erated \underline{\textbf{Co}}operative
\underline{\textbf{P}}seudo \underline{\textbf{L}}abeling (\textbf{FedCoPL}).
Specifically, clients estimate and upload their pseudo label distribution, and
the server adjusts and redistributes them to avoid global imbalance among
classes. Moreover, we introduce a partial prompt aggregation protocol for
effective collaboration and personalization. In particular, visual prompts
containing general image features are aggregated at the server, while text
prompts encoding personalized knowledge are retained locally. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our FedCoPL compared to
baseline methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACRE的强化学习方法，通过一致性检查改进GRPO算法，以减少推理链与最终答案之间的不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法虽然提高了答案准确性，但可能导致推理链与答案不一致，因此需要一种方法来确保推理与答案的一致性。

Method: ACRE通过引入一致性检查奖励机制，要求模型在答案选项打乱后仍能保持一致的答案，从而惩罚推理与答案的不匹配。

Result: 在视频推理和数学推理任务中，ACRE分别比GRPO基线提高了2.2%和1.5%。

Conclusion: ACRE有效减少了推理与答案的不一致性，提升了模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can significantly enhance
reasoning abilities by directly optimizing correctness, rather than relying
solely on supervised imitation. This paradigm has been extended to multimodal
LLMs for complex video and image understanding tasks. However, while
outcome-driven RL improves answer accuracy, it can inadvertently decouple the
reasoning chain from the final answer, leading to situations where models
produce inconsistency between the reasoning trace and final answer. In our
experiments on multiple-choice visual question-answering tasks, the standard
GRPO method yields only 79.7\% consistency on MMVU between the reasoning steps
and the chosen answers, indicating frequent mismatches between answers and
reasoning. To this end, we propose Answer-Consistent Reinforcement Learning
(ACRE) that modifies the GRPO algorithm with an auxiliary consistency check.
After the model generates a chain of thought and an initial answer for a given
question, we shuffle the answer options and prompt the model again with the
same reasoning trace to predict a second answer. We design a
consistency-verification reward that grants a high reward only if both the
original and the post-shuffle answers agree and are correct; otherwise, a lower
reward is assigned accordingly. This mechanism penalizes reasoning-answer
misalignment and discourages the model from relying on spurious patterns, such
as option ordering biases. We evaluate ACRE on challenging Video Reasoning
benchmarks and multimodal math reasoning benchmarks, achieving an average 2.2\%
and 1.5\% improvement for Video Reasoning and Math Reasoning tasks over the
GRPO baseline.

Conclusion: 后检测重评分能有效增强紧凑模型在真实场景火灾烟雾检测中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate fire and smoke detection is critical for safety and disaster
response, yet existing vision-based methods face challenges in balancing
efficiency and reliability. Compact deep learning models such as YOLOv5n and
YOLOv8n are widely adopted for deployment on UAVs, CCTV systems, and IoT
devices, but their reduced capacity often results in false positives and missed
detections. Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression
and Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or
retain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these
limitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that
rescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain
relevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates
uncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust
detection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire
dataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision
compared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead. These
results highlight the effectiveness of post-detection rescoring in enhancing
the robustness of compact deep learning models for real-world fire and smoke
detection.

TL;DR: ICFC是一种无需训练的框架，利用多模态大语言模型进行可解释的图像篡改定位，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像篡改技术发展迅速，现有监督方法依赖昂贵标注，而弱监督或无训练方法性能不足且缺乏可解释性。

Method: ICFC通过对象化规则构建和自适应过滤建立知识库，并采用多步渐进推理流程，从粗到细定位篡改区域。

Result: ICFC在多个基准测试中超越无训练方法，甚至优于弱监督和全监督方法。

Conclusion: ICFC为图像篡改定位提供了高效、可解释且无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image tampering pose serious security threats, underscoring the
need for effective image manipulation localization (IML). While supervised IML
achieves strong performance, it depends on costly pixel-level annotations.
Existing weakly supervised or training-free alternatives often underperform and
lack interpretability. We propose the In-Context Forensic Chain (ICFC), a
training-free framework that leverages multi-modal large language models
(MLLMs) for interpretable IML tasks. ICFC integrates an objectified rule
construction with adaptive filtering to build a reliable knowledge base and a
multi-step progressive reasoning pipeline that mirrors expert forensic
workflows from coarse proposals to fine-grained forensics results. This design
enables systematic exploitation of MLLM reasoning for image-level
classification, pixel-level localization, and text-level interpretability.
Across multiple benchmarks, ICFC not only surpasses state-of-the-art
training-free methods but also achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to weakly and fully supervised approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了ImmerIris数据集，用于解决沉浸式环境中离轴虹膜识别的挑战，并提出了一种无需归一化的新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 沉浸式环境中的虹膜识别面临离轴采集带来的独特挑战，如透视变形和质量退化，现有数据集和方法无法满足需求。

Method: 提出ImmerIris数据集，包含499,791张图像，并设计了一种无需归一化的识别方法。

Result: 新方法在沉浸式环境中表现优于传统归一化方法。

Conclusion: 无需归一化的方法为沉浸式虹膜识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: In egocentric applications such as augmented and virtual reality, immersive
iris recognition is emerging as an accurate and seamless way to identify
persons. While classic systems acquire iris images on-axis, i.e., via dedicated
frontal sensors in controlled settings, the immersive setup primarily captures
off-axis irises through tilt-placed headset cameras, with only mild control in
open scenes. This yields unique challenges, including perspective distortion,
intensified quality degradations, and intra-class variations in iris texture.
Datasets capturing these challenges remain scarce. To fill this gap, this paper
introduces ImmerIris, a large-scale dataset collected via VR headsets,
containing 499,791 ocular images from 564 subjects. It is, to the best of
current knowledge, the largest public dataset and among the first dedicated to
off-axis acquisition. Based on ImmerIris, evaluation protocols are constructed
to benchmark recognition methods under different challenging factors. Current
methods, primarily designed for classic on-axis imagery, perform
unsatisfactorily on the immersive setup, mainly due to reliance on fallible
normalization. To this end, this paper further proposes a normalization-free
paradigm that directly learns from ocular images with minimal adjustment.
Despite its simplicity, this approach consistently outperforms
normalization-based counterparts, pointing to a promising direction for robust
immersive recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手势识别系统对帕金森病严重程度的评估准确性不足，需要更有效的非侵入性工具支持临床管理。

Method: 从手指敲击视频提取时空特征，设计混合深度学习框架（CNN、BiLSTM和注意力机制）进行多类分类。

Result: 模型在五类严重程度分类中表现优异，验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合时空表示和注意力机制的模型有望成为支持临床帕金森病监测的非侵入性工具。

Abstract: Effective clinical management and intervention development depend on accurate
evaluation of Parkinsons disease (PD) severity. Many researchers have worked on
developing gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance
accuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson
Disease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced
CNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,
and amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a
hybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention
mechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion
features. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D
MaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature
maps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics. An attention
mechanism focuses on the most informative temporal features, producing a
context vector that is further processed by a second BiLSTM layer. CNN-derived
features and attention-enhanced BiLSTM outputs are concatenated, followed by
dense and dropout layers, before the final softmax classifier outputs the
predicted PD severity level. The model demonstrated strong performance in
distinguishing between the five severity classes, suggesting that integrating
spatial temporal representations with attention mechanisms can improve
automated PD severity detection, making it a promising non-invasive tool to
support clinicians in PD monitoring and progression tracking.

TL;DR: DeepFusionNet架构解决了低光图像增强和超分辨率问题，参数少且性能优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光和模糊图像在实时传输中表现不佳，现有方法参数多且性能不足。

Method: 提出DeepFusionNet架构，用于低光增强和超分辨率任务，参数较少。

Result: 在LOL-v1数据集上，SSIM达92.8%，PSNR为26.30；超分辨率任务中PSNR为25.30，SSIM为80.7%。

Conclusion: DeepFusionNet在低光和超分辨率任务中表现优异，参数效率高。

Abstract: Computer vision and image processing applications suffer from dark and
low-light images, particularly during real-time image transmission. Currently,
low light and dark images are converted to bright and colored forms using
autoencoders; however, these methods often achieve low SSIM and PSNR scores and
require high computational power due to their large number of parameters. To
address these challenges, the DeepFusionNet architecture has been developed.
According to the results obtained with the LOL-v1 dataset, DeepFusionNet
achieved an SSIM of 92.8% and a PSNR score of 26.30, while containing only
approximately 2.5 million parameters. On the other hand, conversion of blurry
and low-resolution images into high-resolution and blur-free images has gained
importance in image processing applications. Unlike GAN-based super-resolution
methods, an autoencoder-based super resolution model has been developed that
contains approximately 100 thousand parameters and uses the DeepFusionNet
architecture. According to the results of the tests, the DeepFusionNet based
super-resolution method achieved a PSNR of 25.30 and a SSIM score of 80.7
percent according to the validation set.

Conclusion: YOLOv11-Litchi适用于复杂果园环境，展示了在精准农业中的广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Litchi is a high-value fruit, yet traditional manual selection methods are
increasingly inadequate for modern production demands. Integrating UAV-based
aerial imagery with deep learning offers a promising solution to enhance
efficiency and reduce costs. This paper introduces YOLOv11-Litchi, a
lightweight and robust detection model specifically designed for UAV-based
litchi detection. Built upon the YOLOv11 framework, the proposed model
addresses key challenges such as small target size, large model parameters
hindering deployment, and frequent target occlusion. To tackle these issues,
three major innovations are incorporated: a multi-scale residual module to
improve contextual feature extraction across scales, a lightweight feature
fusion method to reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining
high accuracy, and a litchi occlusion detection head to mitigate occlusion
effects by emphasizing target regions and suppressing background interference.
Experimental results validate the model's effectiveness. YOLOv11-Litchi
achieves a parameter size of 6.35 MB - 32.5% smaller than the YOLOv11 baseline
- while improving mAP by 2.5% to 90.1% and F1-Score by 1.4% to 85.5%.
Additionally, the model achieves a frame rate of 57.2 FPS, meeting real-time
detection requirements. These findings demonstrate the suitability of
YOLOv11-Litchi for UAV-based litchi detection in complex orchard environments,
showcasing its potential for broader applications in precision agriculture.

TL;DR: Color3D是一个灵活的用户引导框架，用于从单色输入中为静态和动态3D场景着色，保持色彩多样性和可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常牺牲色彩丰富性和可控性以保持多视角一致性，而Color3D旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过个性化颜色器，从关键视图传播颜色到新视角和时间步，确保跨视角和时间的一致性。

Result: 实验表明，Color3D能生成更一致且色彩丰富的渲染结果，并提供精确的用户控制。

Conclusion: Color3D将复杂3D着色问题简化为单图像范式，提升了灵活性和可控性。

Abstract: In this work, we present Color3D, a highly adaptable framework for colorizing
both static and dynamic 3D scenes from monochromatic inputs, delivering
visually diverse and chromatically vibrant reconstructions with flexible
user-guided control. In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on
static scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color
variations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and
controllability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and
steerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In
particular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key
view and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to
novel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a
scene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,
enabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in
novel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the
personalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all
other images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a
dedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed
framework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable
single image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image
colorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability. Extensive
experiments across diverse static and dynamic 3D colorization benchmarks
substantiate that our method can deliver more consistent and chromatically rich
renderings with precise user control. Project Page

in focus primarily on lesion segmentation, with limited work on vessel
localization. In this study, we introduce Stroke Locus Net, an end-to-end deep
learning pipeline for detection, segmentation, and occluded vessel localization
using only MRI scans. The proposed system combines a segmentation branch using
nnUNet for lesion detection with an arterial atlas for vessel mapping and
identification, and a generation branch using pGAN to synthesize MRA images
from MRI. Our implementation demonstrates promising results in localizing
occluded vessels on stroke-affected T1 MRI scans, with potential for faster and
more informed stroke diagnosis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在单一框架中统一角色生成和编辑任务，生成方法在细粒度一致性上表现不佳，而编辑方法则缺乏空间可控性和指令对齐。

Method: ReMix包含两个核心组件：ReMix模块利用MLLMs的多模态推理能力编辑输入图像的语义特征；IP-ControlNet扩展了ControlNet，解耦参考图像的语义和布局线索，并引入ε-等价潜在空间。

Result: ReMix支持个性化生成、图像编辑、风格迁移和多条件合成等多种任务，实验验证了其作为统一框架的有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: ReMix通过结合语义编辑和布局控制，实现了角色一致的高质量图像生成和编辑，为相关任务提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models (e.g., FLUX.1)
have greatly improved visual fidelity in consistent character generation and
editing. However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single
framework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity
consistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial
controllability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose
ReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It
constitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix
Module leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic
features of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT
backbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,
pixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address
this, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues
from reference images and introduces an {\epsilon}-equivariant latent space
that jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise
space. Inspired by convergent evolution and quantum decoherence,i.e., where
environmental noise drives state convergence, this design promotes feature
alignment in the hidden space, enabling consistent object generation while
preserving identity. ReMix supports a wide range of tasks, including
personalized generation, image editing, style transfer, and multi-condition
synthesis. Extensive experiments validate its effectiveness and efficiency as a
unified framework for character-consistent image generation and editing.

TL;DR: SaFiRe框架通过模仿人类两阶段认知过程，解决了RIS中对象干扰和类别隐式表达的问题，并在新基准aRefCOCO上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RIS方法主要处理简单表达，难以应对对象干扰和类别隐式表达等复杂场景。

Method: 提出SaFiRe框架，利用Mamba的扫描-更新特性实现多轮细化，支持全局理解和细节检查。

Result: 在标准和新数据集上，SaFiRe优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: SaFiRe通过两阶段设计有效处理复杂表达，为RIS领域提供了新思路。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an
image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage
pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive
results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun
phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to
a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle
referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging
real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple
entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the
object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a
novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive
process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through
detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's
scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables
efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce
aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous
referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed
datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在两个水下数据集上，SparseUWSeg比现有方法（如D+NN）提升了5%的mIoU。

Conclusion: SparseUWSeg提供了一个简单有效的交互式标注工具，帮助生态研究者高效生成高质量分割掩码。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is essential to automate underwater imagery analysis
with ecology monitoring purposes. Unfortunately, fine grained underwater scene
analysis is still an open problem even for top performing segmentation models.
The high cost of obtaining dense, expert-annotated, segmentation labels hinders
the supervision of models in this domain. While sparse point-labels are easier
to obtain, they introduce challenges regarding which points to annotate and how
to propagate the sparse information. We present SparseUWSeg, a novel framework
that addresses both issues. SparseUWSeg employs an active sampling strategy to
guide annotators, maximizing the value of their point labels. Then, it
propagates these sparse labels with a hybrid approach leverages both the best
of SAM2 and superpixel-based methods. Experiments on two diverse underwater
datasets demonstrate the benefits of SparseUWSeg over state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving up to +5\% mIoU over D+NN. Our main contribution is the
design and release of a simple but effective interactive annotation tool,
integrating our algorithms. It enables ecology researchers to leverage
foundation models and computer vision to efficiently generate high-quality
segmentation masks to process their data.

Result: 在合成和真实医疗数据集上，ViConEx-Med优于现有概念模型，并在概念检测和定位精度上与黑盒模型竞争。

Conclusion: ViConEx-Med为基于视觉概念构建内在可解释模型提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Concept-based models aim to explain model decisions with human-understandable
concepts. However, most existing approaches treat concepts as numerical
attributes, without providing complementary visual explanations that could
localize the predicted concepts. This limits their utility in real-world
applications and particularly in high-stakes scenarios, such as medical
use-cases. This paper proposes ViConEx-Med, a novel transformer-based framework
for visual concept explainability, which introduces multi-concept learnable
tokens to jointly predict and localize visual concepts. By leveraging
specialized attention layers for processing visual and text-based concept
tokens, our method produces concept-level localization maps while maintaining
high predictive accuracy. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world medical
datasets demonstrate that ViConEx-Med outperforms prior concept-based models
and achieves competitive performance with black-box models in terms of both
concept detection and localization precision. Our results suggest a promising
direction for building inherently interpretable models grounded in visual
concepts. Code is publicly available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注物体前表面的3D坐标预测，忽略了后表面和内部的潜在价值。

Method: 预测物体前后表面的3D坐标并密集采样内部坐标，结合HCCE编码技术。

Result: 在BOP核心数据集上优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: 利用物体全表面和内部信息能显著提升姿态估计精度。

Abstract: In pose estimation for seen objects, a prevalent pipeline involves using
neural networks to predict dense 3D coordinates of the object surface on 2D
images, which are then used to establish dense 2D-3D correspondences. However,
current methods primarily focus on more efficient encoding techniques to
improve the precision of predicted 3D coordinates on the object's front
surface, overlooking the potential benefits of incorporating the back surface
and interior of the object. To better utilize the full surface and interior of
the object, this study predicts 3D coordinates of both the object's front and
back surfaces and densely samples 3D coordinates between them. This process
creates ultra-dense 2D-3D correspondences, effectively enhancing pose
estimation accuracy based on the Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm.
Additionally, we propose Hierarchical Continuous Coordinate Encoding (HCCE) to
provide a more accurate and efficient representation of front and back surface
coordinates. Experimental results show that, compared to existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the BOP website, the proposed approach
outperforms across seven classic BOP core datasets. Code is available at

Conclusion: DVTMD和TCMA为无人机视频文本检索提供了新基准，显著提升了检索效果。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become powerful platforms for real-time,
high-resolution data collection, producing massive volumes of aerial videos.
Efficient retrieval of relevant content from these videos is crucial for
applications in urban management, emergency response, security, and disaster
relief. While text-video retrieval has advanced in natural video domains, the
UAV domain remains underexplored due to limitations in existing datasets, such
as coarse and redundant captions. Thus, in this work, we construct the Drone
Video-Text Match Dataset (DVTMD), which contains 2,864 videos and 14,320
fine-grained, semantically diverse captions. The annotations capture multiple
complementary aspects, including human actions, objects, background settings,
environmental conditions, and visual style, thereby enhancing text-video
correspondence and reducing redundancy. Building on this dataset, we propose
the Text-Conditioned Multi-granularity Alignment (TCMA) framework, which
integrates global video-sentence alignment, sentence-guided frame aggregation,
and word-guided patch alignment. To further refine local alignment, we design a
Word and Patch Selection module that filters irrelevant content, as well as a
Text-Adaptive Dynamic Temperature Mechanism that adapts attention sharpness to
text type. Extensive experiments on DVTMD and CapERA establish the first
complete benchmark for drone text-video retrieval. Our TCMA achieves
state-of-the-art performance, including 45.5% R@1 in text-to-video and 42.8%
R@1 in video-to-text retrieval, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset
and method. The code and dataset will be released.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为伪平衡的方法，用于在半监督学习中缓解人脸性别分类模型的偏见，显著提高了公平性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸性别分类模型在训练数据中常存在性别和种族偏见，导致在不同子群体中表现不均。

Method: 通过伪平衡策略，在伪标签选择过程中强制实施人口平衡，仅使用未标记的种族平衡数据集。

Result: 在AAF基准测试中，伪平衡方法将总体准确率提高了6.53%，性别准确率差距减少了44.17%，在东亚子群体中差距从49%缩小到5.01%。

Conclusion: 即使在没有标签监督的情况下，使用人口平衡或适度倾斜的未标记数据集可以有效减少计算机视觉模型的偏见。

Abstract: Face gender classification models often reflect and amplify demographic
biases present in their training data, leading to uneven performance across
gender and racial subgroups. We introduce pseudo-balancing, a simple and
effective strategy for mitigating such biases in semi-supervised learning. Our
method enforces demographic balance during pseudo-label selection, using only
unlabeled images from a race-balanced dataset without requiring access to
ground-truth annotations.
  We evaluate pseudo-balancing under two conditions: (1) fine-tuning a biased
gender classifier using unlabeled images from the FairFace dataset, and (2)
stress-testing the method with intentionally imbalanced training data to
simulate controlled bias scenarios. In both cases, models are evaluated on the
All-Age-Faces (AAF) benchmark, which contains a predominantly East Asian
population. Our results show that pseudo-balancing consistently improves
fairness while preserving or enhancing accuracy. The method achieves 79.81%
overall accuracy - a 6.53% improvement over the baseline - and reduces the
gender accuracy gap by 44.17%. In the East Asian subgroup, where baseline
disparities exceeded 49%, the gap is narrowed to just 5.01%. These findings
suggest that even in the absence of label supervision, access to a
demographically balanced or moderately skewed unlabeled dataset can serve as a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅建模成对对象关系，忽略了n元组合在多模态关系理解中的全局感知重要性。

Result: 在ReferIt3D和ScanRefer基准测试中表现优于现有方法，证明了n元关系感知在3D定位中的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过n元关系学习显著提升了3D对象定位的准确性。

Abstract: Localizing 3D objects using natural language is essential for robotic scene
understanding. The descriptions often involve multiple spatial relationships to
distinguish similar objects, making 3D-language alignment difficult. Current
methods only model relationships for pairwise objects, ignoring the global
perceptual significance of n-ary combinations in multi-modal relational
understanding. To address this, we propose a novel progressive relational
learning framework for 3D object grounding. We extend relational learning from
binary to n-ary to identify visual relations that match the referential
description globally. Given the absence of specific annotations for referred
objects in the training data, we design a grouped supervision loss to
facilitate n-ary relational learning. In the scene graph created with n-ary
relationships, we use a multi-modal network with hybrid attention mechanisms to
further localize the target within the n-ary combinations. Experiments and
ablation studies on the ReferIt3D and ScanRefer benchmarks demonstrate that our
method outperforms the state-of-the-art, and proves the advantages of the n-ary
relational perception in 3D localization.

Motivation: 宫颈癌诊断需要高精度和泛化能力的工具，现有深度学习模型和通用基础模型在专科特征捕捉和任务适应性上不足。

Method: CerS-Path通过自监督学习（1.9亿组织块）和多模态增强（250万图文对）两阶段预训练，整合多种下游诊断功能。

Result: 系统支持8种诊断功能，多中心测试中筛查敏感性达99.38%，泛化能力优异。

Conclusion: CerS-Path在宫颈病理诊断中表现突出，具备专科诊断转化和筛查潜力。

Abstract: Cervical cancer remains a major malignancy, necessitating extensive and
complex histopathological assessments and comprehensive support tools. Although
deep learning shows promise, these models still lack accuracy and
generalizability. General foundation models offer a broader reach but remain
limited in capturing subspecialty-specific features and task adaptability. We
introduce the Cervical Subspecialty Pathology (CerS-Path) diagnostic system,
developed through two synergistic pretraining stages: self-supervised learning
on approximately 190 million tissue patches from 140,000 slides to build a
cervical-specific feature extractor, and multimodal enhancement with 2.5
million image-text pairs, followed by integration with multiple downstream
diagnostic functions. Supporting eight diagnostic functions, including rare
cancer classification and multimodal Q&A, CerS-Path surpasses prior foundation
models in scope and clinical applicability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate a significant advance in cervical pathology, with prospective
testing on 3,173 cases across five centers maintaining 99.38% screening
sensitivity and excellent generalizability, highlighting its potential for
subspecialty diagnostic translation and cervical cancer screening.

Abstract: Ensuring the reliability of autonomous driving perception systems requires
extensive environment-based testing, yet real-world execution is often
impractical. Synthetic datasets have therefore emerged as a promising
alternative, offering advantages such as cost-effectiveness, bias free
labeling, and controllable scenarios. However, the domain gap between synthetic
and real-world datasets remains a critical bottleneck for the generalization of
AI-based autonomous driving models. Quantifying this synthetic-to-real gap is
thus essential for evaluating dataset utility and guiding the design of more
effective training pipelines. In this paper, we establish a systematic
framework for quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap in autonomous driving
systems, and propose Style Embedding Distribution Discrepancy (SEDD) as a novel
evaluation metric. Our framework combines Gram matrix-based style extraction
with metric learning optimized for intra-class compactness and inter-class
separation to extract style embeddings. Furthermore, we establish a benchmark
using publicly available datasets. Experiments are conducted on a variety of
datasets and sim-to-real methods, and the results show that our method is
capable of quantifying the synthetic-to-real gap. This work provides a
standardized quality control tool that enables systematic diagnosis and
targeted enhancement of synthetic datasets, advancing future development of
data-driven autonomous driving systems.

Result: 基于AnomReason微调的模型在语义匹配指标（SemAP/SemF1）上表现优于基线。

Conclusion: AnomReason和AnomAgent为提升AI生成图像的语义可信度提供了基础工具。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of
  AI-generated content (AIGC) has enabled the synthesis of visually convincing
images; however, many such outputs exhibit subtle \textbf{semantic anomalies},
including unrealistic object configurations, violations of physical laws, or
commonsense inconsistencies, which compromise the overall plausibility of the
generated scenes. Detecting these semantic-level anomalies
  is essential for assessing the trustworthiness of AIGC media, especially in
AIGC image analysis, explainable deepfake detection and semantic authenticity
assessment. In this paper,
  we formalize \textbf{semantic anomaly detection and reasoning} for AIGC
images and
  introduce \textbf{AnomReason}, a large-scale benchmark with structured
annotations as quadruples \emph{(Name, Phenomenon, Reasoning, Severity)}.
Annotations are produced by
  a modular multi-agent pipeline (\textbf{AnomAgent}) with lightweight
human-in-the-loop verification, enabling scale while preserving quality.
  At construction time, AnomAgent processed approximately 4.17\,B GPT-4o
tokens, providing scale evidence for the resulting structured annotations. We
further
  show that models fine-tuned on AnomReason achieve consistent gains over
strong vision-language baselines under our proposed semantic matching metric
(\textit{SemAP} and \textit{SemF1}).
  Applications to {explainable deepfake detection} and {semantic reasonableness
assessment of image generators} demonstrate practical utility. In summary,
AnomReason and AnomAgent
  serve as a foundation for measuring and improving the semantic plausibility
of AI-generated images. We will release code, metrics, data, and task-aligned
models to support reproducible research on semantic authenticity and
interpretable AIGC forensics.

TL;DR: 大型生成模型在零样本医学影像任务中表现出色，无需领域微调即可完成器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和运动预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自回归视频建模原理是否可直接应用于医学影像任务，尽管模型未在医学数据上训练。

Method: 在零样本设置下评估大型视觉模型（LVM）在四个任务中的表现：器官分割、去噪、超分辨率和运动预测。

Result: LVM在未接触医学数据的情况下，在所有任务中表现优异，尤其在放疗运动预测中达到最先进的空间准确性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了零样本医学视频建模的潜力，为未来基于视频模型的医学基础模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in large generative models have shown that simple
autoregressive formulations, when scaled appropriately, can exhibit strong
zero-shot generalization across domains. Motivated by this trend, we
investigate whether autoregressive video modeling principles can be directly
applied to medical imaging tasks, despite the model never being trained on
medical data. Specifically, we evaluate a large vision model (LVM) in a
zero-shot setting across four representative tasks: organ segmentation,
denoising, super-resolution, and motion prediction. Remarkably, even without
domain-specific fine-tuning, the LVM can delineate anatomical structures in CT
scans and achieve competitive performance on segmentation, denoising, and
super-resolution. Most notably, in radiotherapy motion prediction, the model
forecasts future 3D CT phases directly from prior phases of a 4D CT scan,
producing anatomically consistent predictions that capture patient-specific
respiratory dynamics with realistic temporal coherence. We evaluate the LVM on
4D CT data from 122 patients, totaling over 1,820 3D CT volumes. Despite no
prior exposure to medical data, the model achieves strong performance across
all tasks and surpasses specialized DVF-based and generative baselines in
motion prediction, achieving state-of-the-art spatial accuracy. These findings
reveal the emergence of zero-shot capabilities in medical video modeling and
highlight the potential of general-purpose video models to serve as unified
learners and reasoners laying the groundwork for future medical foundation
models built on video models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的框架，通过优化核心算法提高效率，减少过拟合和冗余重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在少样本场景中容易过拟合且重建冗余，现有方法如FSGS虽提高质量但增加了基元数量。

Method: 采用新的密度触发机制（基于不透明度梯度）和保守的剪枝策略，结合深度相关损失。

Result: 在3-view LLFF数据集上，模型比FSGS紧凑40%（32k vs. 57k基元）；在Mip-NeRF 360数据集上减少约70%基元。

Conclusion: 该框架在少样本视图合成的质量与效率权衡上达到新最优，显著提升紧凑性且仅轻微牺牲重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) struggles in few-shot scenarios, where its
standard adaptive density control (ADC) can lead to overfitting and bloated
reconstructions. While state-of-the-art methods like FSGS improve quality, they
often do so by significantly increasing the primitive count. This paper
presents a framework that revises the core 3DGS optimization to prioritize
efficiency. We replace the standard positional gradient heuristic with a novel
densification trigger that uses the opacity gradient as a lightweight proxy for
rendering error. We find this aggressive densification is only effective when
paired with a more conservative pruning schedule, which prevents destructive
optimization cycles. Combined with a standard depth-correlation loss for
geometric guidance, our framework demonstrates a fundamental improvement in
efficiency. On the 3-view LLFF dataset, our model is over 40% more compact (32k
vs. 57k primitives) than FSGS, and on the Mip-NeRF 360 dataset, it achieves a
reduction of approximately 70%. This dramatic gain in compactness is achieved
with a modest trade-off in reconstruction metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art on the quality-vs-efficiency Pareto frontier for few-shot view
synthesis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在音频和姿态驱动的人体动画中常遇到头部僵硬和手部模糊的问题，主要由于音频与头部运动相关性弱以及手部结构复杂。

Method: 1. 预训练手部清晰度码本（HCC）以编码高保真手部纹理先验；2. 设计双流音频感知模块（DSAA）分别建模唇同步和头部姿态动态；3. 引入姿态校准技巧（PCT）优化姿态条件。

Result: 实验表明，VividAnimator在手部细节、手势真实性和身份一致性方面表现优异，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: VividAnimator通过创新模块解决了现有问题，显著提升了动画质量。

Abstract: Existing for audio- and pose-driven human animation methods often struggle
with stiff head movements and blurry hands, primarily due to the weak
correlation between audio and head movements and the structural complexity of
hands. To address these issues, we propose VividAnimator, an end-to-end
framework for generating high-quality, half-body human animations driven by
audio and sparse hand pose conditions. Our framework introduces three key
innovations. First, to overcome the instability and high cost of online
codebook training, we pre-train a Hand Clarity Codebook (HCC) that encodes
rich, high-fidelity hand texture priors, significantly mitigating hand
degradation. Second, we design a Dual-Stream Audio-Aware Module (DSAA) to model
lip synchronization and natural head pose dynamics separately while enabling
interaction. Third, we introduce a Pose Calibration Trick (PCT) that refines
and aligns pose conditions by relaxing rigid constraints, ensuring smooth and
natural gesture transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Vivid
Animator achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing videos with superior
hand detail, gesture realism, and identity consistency, validated by both
quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations.

Conclusion: 展示了基础模型BEV地图在自动驾驶感知中的潜力，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Camera-based 3D object detection and tracking are essential for perception in
autonomous driving. Current state-of-the-art approaches often rely exclusively
on either perspective-view (PV) or bird's-eye-view (BEV) features, limiting
their ability to leverage both fine-grained object details and spatially
structured scene representations. In this work, we propose DualViewDistill, a
hybrid detection and tracking framework that incorporates both PV and BEV
camera image features to leverage their complementary strengths. Our approach
introduces BEV maps guided by foundation models, leveraging descriptive DINOv2
features that are distilled into BEV representations through a novel
distillation process. By integrating PV features with BEV maps enriched with
semantic and geometric features from DINOv2, our model leverages this hybrid
representation via deformable aggregation to enhance 3D object detection and
tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 benchmarks
demonstrate that DualViewDistill achieves state-of-the-art performance. The
results showcase the potential of foundation model BEV maps to enable more
reliable perception for autonomous driving. We make the code and pre-trained
models available at https://dualviewdistill.cs.uni-freiburg.de .

Result: 在11个眼底分割数据集上，SAM2LoRA在血管和视盘分割任务中分别达到Dice分数0.86和0.93，AUC值0.98和0.99，性能领先。

Conclusion: SAM2LoRA通过高效参数微调和复合损失函数，显著提升了SAM2模型在眼底图像分割任务中的性能，同时降低了训练成本。

Abstract: We propose SAM2LoRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that adapts
the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for fundus image segmentation. SAM2 employs
a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale
feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however,
fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a
low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer
than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for
cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining
segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal
network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,
SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc
segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores
of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation,
respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art
performance while substantially reducing training overhead.

Result: 生成的场景逼真，难以与真实ScanNet场景区分。

Conclusion: FactoredScenes能有效生成真实世界的3D场景，解决了数据有限和姿态多样性的挑战。

Abstract: Real-world scenes, such as those in ScanNet, are difficult to capture, with
highly limited data available. Generating realistic scenes with varied object
poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose
FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging
the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses
from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes
scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object
poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions
capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large
language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned
library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a
program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves
and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates
realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet
scenes.

Result: 实验验证显示最低重叠需求降低20%。

Conclusion: Ortho-Fuse为AI驱动的农业监测系统提供了更可行的技术路径。

Abstract: AI-driven crop health mapping systems offer substantial advantages over
conventional monitoring approaches through accelerated data acquisition and
cost reduction. However, widespread farmer adoption remains constrained by
technical limitations in orthomosaic generation from sparse aerial imagery
datasets. Traditional photogrammetric reconstruction requires 70-80\%
inter-image overlap to establish sufficient feature correspondences for
accurate geometric registration. AI-driven systems operating under
resource-constrained conditions cannot consistently achieve these overlap
thresholds, resulting in degraded reconstruction quality that undermines user
confidence in autonomous monitoring technologies. In this paper, we present
Ortho-Fuse, an optical flow-based framework that enables the generation of a
reliable orthomosaic with reduced overlap requirements. Our approach employs
intermediate flow estimation to synthesize transitional imagery between
consecutive aerial frames, artificially augmenting feature correspondences for
improved geometric reconstruction. Experimental validation demonstrates a 20\%
reduction in minimum overlap requirements. We further analyze adoption barriers
in precision agriculture to identify pathways for enhanced integration of
AI-driven monitoring systems.

Conclusion: PointMAC通过样本特定优化和梯度平衡，显著提升了点云补全的质量和适应性。

Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robust 3D perception in
safety-critical applications such as robotics and augmented reality. However,
existing models perform static inference and rely heavily on inductive biases
learned during training, limiting their ability to adapt to novel structural
patterns and sensor-induced distortions at test time. To address this
limitation, we propose PointMAC, a meta-learned framework for robust test-time
adaptation in point cloud completion. It enables sample-specific refinement
without requiring additional supervision. Our method optimizes the completion
model under two self-supervised auxiliary objectives that simulate structural
and sensor-level incompleteness. A meta-auxiliary learning strategy based on
Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) ensures that adaptation driven by auxiliary
objectives is consistently aligned with the primary completion task. During
inference, we adapt the shared encoder on-the-fly by optimizing auxiliary
losses, with the decoder kept fixed. To further stabilize adaptation, we
introduce Adaptive $\lambda$-Calibration, a meta-learned mechanism for
balancing gradients between primary and auxiliary objectives. Extensive
experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real-world datasets demonstrate that
PointMAC achieves state-of-the-art results by refining each sample individually
to produce high-quality completions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to apply meta-auxiliary test-time adaptation to point cloud
completion.

Conclusion: Vision4PPG为临床科学家提供了高效且通用的新工具，扩展了视觉模型在PPG处理中的应用。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor in wearable and clinical devices provides
valuable physiological insights in a non-invasive and real-time fashion.
Specialized Foundation Models (FM) or repurposed time-series FMs are used to
benchmark physiological tasks. Our experiments with fine-tuning FMs reveal that
Vision FM (VFM) can also be utilized for this purpose and, in fact,
surprisingly leads to state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on many tasks,
notably blood pressure estimation. We leverage VFMs by simply transforming
one-dimensional PPG signals into image-like two-dimensional representations,
such as the Short-Time Fourier transform (STFT). Using the latest VFMs, such as
DINOv3 and SIGLIP-2, we achieve promising performance on other vital signs and
blood lab measurement tasks as well. Our proposal, Vision4PPG, unlocks a new
class of FMs to achieve SOTA performance with notable generalization to other
2D input representations, including STFT phase and recurrence plots. Our work
improves upon prior investigations of vision models for PPG by conducting a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统裂缝检测依赖昂贵且耗时的像素级标注，限制了大规模基础设施监测的可扩展性。

Method: 提出Crack-Segmenter框架，包含三个模块：SAE（多尺度特征提取）、DAT（保持裂缝连续性）和AGF（自适应特征融合）。

Result: 在十个公开数据集上，Crack-Segmenter在mIoU、Dice等指标上优于13种监督方法。

Conclusion: 无标注裂缝检测不仅可行且更优，为基础设施监测提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pavement crack detection has long depended on costly and time-intensive
pixel-level annotations, which limit its scalability for large-scale
infrastructure monitoring. To overcome this barrier, this paper examines the
feasibility of achieving effective pixel-level crack segmentation entirely
without manual annotations. Building on this objective, a fully self-supervised
framework, Crack-Segmenter, is developed, integrating three complementary
modules: the Scale-Adaptive Embedder (SAE) for robust multi-scale feature
extraction, the Directional Attention Transformer (DAT) for maintaining linear
crack continuity, and the Attention-Guided Fusion (AGF) module for adaptive
feature integration. Through evaluations on ten public datasets,
Crack-Segmenter consistently outperforms 13 state-of-the-art supervised methods
across all major metrics, including mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice
score, XOR, and Hausdorff Distance (HD). These findings demonstrate that
annotation-free crack detection is not only feasible but also superior,
enabling transportation agencies and infrastructure managers to conduct
scalable and cost-effective monitoring. This work advances self-supervised
learning and motivates pavement cracks detection research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文讨论了CNN中的隐藏偏见问题，提出了识别偏见的方法，并探索了CNN是否从无关特征中学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CNN的非直观数据驱动特性，其决策过程可能受到难以检测的背景信息影响，导致偏见。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1) 将图像分割为随机打乱的非重叠小图块；2) 应用多种图像变换（如傅里叶变换、小波变换和中值滤波）以恢复背景噪声信息。

Result: 实验表明，这些方法能有效区分上下文信息和背景噪声，并在无需背景信息的情况下检测背景噪声。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有助于揭示CNN中的隐藏偏见，提升模型的可解释性和可靠性。

Abstract: CNNs are now prevalent as the primary choice for most machine vision problems
due to their superior rate of classification and the availability of
user-friendly libraries. These networks effortlessly identify and select
features in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to
determine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box",
where users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical
results. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background
information that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such
hidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to
distinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore
whether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify
dataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in
some situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it
more difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank
background. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,
not necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were
tested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid
datasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,
non-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,
making classification more challenging. The second method involves the
application of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,
and Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover
background noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate
that this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and
background noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without
the need to use background information.

AVoCaDO GRPO, which leverages tailored reward functions to further enhance
temporal coherence and dialogue accuracy while regularizing caption length and
reducing collapse. Experimental results demonstrate that AVoCaDO significantly
outperforms existing open-source models across four audiovisual video
captioning benchmarks, and also achieves competitive performance on the VDC and
DREAM-1K benchmark under visual-only settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的步态识别方法在视角变化、遮挡和噪声方面表现不佳，而多模态方法虽然鲁棒性更强，但计算成本高。Mesh-Gait旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Mesh-Gait通过重建3D热图作为中间表示，结合2D轮廓和3D几何信息，以高效的方式提取特征。

Result: 实验表明，Mesh-Gait在精度上达到了最先进的水平。

Conclusion: Mesh-Gait通过结合2D和3D信息，显著提升了步态识别的性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: Gait recognition, a fundamental biometric technology, leverages unique
walking patterns for individual identification, typically using 2D
representations such as silhouettes or skeletons. However, these methods often
struggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal
approaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness
but are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time
applications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel
end-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D
representations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of
both modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features
from 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based
gait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an
intermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D
geometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational
efficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually
reconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where
the loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,
and 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial
alignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative
features from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a
computationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture
spatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead
of direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on
motion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mesh-Gait achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. The code will be
released upon acceptance of the paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像特征匹配方法在处理大量特征点时效率较低，且特征空间顺序与极几何独立，可互补提升匹配效果。

Method: 利用初始匹配特征构建特征空间顺序模型，结合极几何过滤不必要的匹配，并提出图像对齐方法消除旋转影响。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在标准数据集、模拟图像和真实图像上均显著提升了匹配效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 结合特征空间顺序和极几何的方法有效改进了图像特征匹配的性能。

Abstract: Image feature matching plays a vital role in many computer vision tasks.
Although many image feature detection and matching techniques have been
proposed over the past few decades, it is still time-consuming to match feature
points in two images, especially for images with a large number of detected
features. Feature spatial order can estimate the probability that a pair of
features is correct. Since it is a completely independent concept from epipolar
geometry, it can be used to complement epipolar geometry in guiding feature
match in a target region so as to improve matching efficiency. In this paper,
we integrate the concept of feature spatial order into a progressive matching
framework. We use some of the initially matched features to build a
computational model of feature spatial order and employs it to calculates the
possible spatial range of subsequent feature matches, thus filtering out
unnecessary feature matches. We also integrate it with epipolar geometry to
further improve matching efficiency and accuracy. Since the spatial order of
feature points is affected by image rotation, we propose a suitable image
alignment method from the fundamental matrix of epipolar geometry to remove the
effect of image rotation. To verify the feasibility of the proposed method, we
conduct a series of experiments, including a standard benchmark dataset,
self-generated simulated images, and real images. The results demonstrate that
our proposed method is significantly more efficient and has more accurate
feature matching than the traditional method.

Result: 在大规模BRIAR数据集上，步态识别和属性估计均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多模态和多任务学习在现实场景中具有潜力，可提升基于步态的人体理解。

Abstract: Gait recognition is an important biometric for human identification at a
distance, particularly under low-resolution or unconstrained environments.
Current works typically focus on either 2D representations (e.g., silhouettes
and skeletons) or 3D representations (e.g., meshes and SMPLs), but relying on a
single modality often fails to capture the full geometric and dynamic
complexity of human walking patterns. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal
and multi-task framework that combines 2D temporal silhouettes with 3D SMPL
features for robust gait analysis. Beyond identification, we introduce a
multitask learning strategy that jointly performs gait recognition and human
attribute estimation, including age, body mass index (BMI), and gender. A
unified transformer is employed to effectively fuse multi-modal gait features
and better learn attribute-related representations, while preserving
discriminative identity cues. Extensive experiments on the large-scale BRIAR
datasets, collected under challenging conditions such as long-range distances
(up to 1 km) and extreme pitch angles (up to 50{\deg}), demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in gait recognition and provides
accurate human attribute estimation. These results highlight the promise of
multi-modal and multitask learning for advancing gait-based human understanding
in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法使用固定尺度扰动，限制了训练姿态的多样性和视野内约束。

Method: 框架包含两个过程：可见性约束扩散过程用于姿态增强，时间步感知反向过程用于渐进姿态细化。

Result: 在两个基准测试（DREAM 和 RoboKeyGen）上表现优异，AUC 达到 66.75，比现有技术提升 32.3%。

Conclusion: MonoSE(3)-Diffusion 通过扩散和细化过程显著提升了姿态估计的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: We propose MonoSE(3)-Diffusion, a monocular SE(3) diffusion framework that
formulates markerless, image-based robot pose estimation as a conditional
denoising diffusion process. The framework consists of two processes: a
visibility-constrained diffusion process for diverse pose augmentation and a
timestep-aware reverse process for progressive pose refinement. The diffusion
process progressively perturbs ground-truth poses to noisy transformations for
training a pose denoising network. Importantly, we integrate visibility
constraints into the process, ensuring the transformations remain within the
camera field of view. Compared to the fixed-scale perturbations used in current
methods, the diffusion process generates in-view and diverse training poses,
thereby improving the network generalization capability. Furthermore, the
reverse process iteratively predicts the poses by the denoising network and
refines pose estimates by sampling from the diffusion posterior of current
timestep, following a scheduled coarse-to-fine procedure. Moreover, the
timestep indicates the transformation scales, which guide the denoising network
to achieve more accurate pose predictions. The reverse process demonstrates
higher robustness than direct prediction, benefiting from its timestep-aware
refinement scheme. Our approach demonstrates improvements across two benchmarks
(DREAM and RoboKeyGen), achieving a notable AUC of 66.75 on the most
challenging dataset, representing a 32.3% gain over the state-of-the-art.

Result: 分类准确率达68.4%，优于现有仅基于视频数据的模型。

Conclusion: 为VR开发者提供实用工具，未来可进一步研究视频时序建模以提升用户体验。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of virtual reality (VR) technology, its adoption
across domains such as healthcare, education, and entertainment has grown
significantly. However, the persistent issue of cybersickness, marked by
symptoms resembling motion sickness, continues to hinder widespread acceptance
of VR. While recent research has explored multimodal deep learning approaches
leveraging data from integrated VR sensors like eye and head tracking, there
remains limited investigation into the use of video-based features for
predicting cybersickness. In this study, we address this gap by utilizing
transfer learning to extract high-level visual features from VR gameplay videos
using the InceptionV3 model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset. These features
are then passed to a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture the
temporal dynamics of the VR experience and predict cybersickness severity over
time. Our approach effectively leverages the time-series nature of video data,
achieving a 68.4% classification accuracy for cybersickness severity. This
surpasses the performance of existing models trained solely on video data,
providing a practical tool for VR developers to evaluate and mitigate
cybersickness in virtual environments. Furthermore, this work lays the
foundation for future research on video-based temporal modeling for enhancing
user comfort in VR applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs在细粒度视觉问答中常因文本查询未明确锚定视觉对象而产生幻觉，现有RAG方法缺乏局部细节和人类化处理。

Method: HuLiRAG采用三阶段推理：开放词汇检测（what）、空间解析（where）和自适应优先级调整（reweight），并结合掩码引导微调。

Result: 实验表明HuLiRAG提高了接地保真度和事实一致性，减少了幻觉。

Conclusion: HuLiRAG通过人类化推理框架，推动了多模态问答的可信推理。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) often fail in fine-grained visual
question answering, producing hallucinations about object identities,
positions, and relations because textual queries are not explicitly anchored to
visual referents. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) alleviates some errors,
but it fails to align with human-like processing at both the retrieval and
augmentation levels. Specifically, it focuses only on global-level image
information but lacks local detail and limits reasoning about fine-grained
interactions. To overcome this limitation, we present Human-Like
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HuLiRAG), a framework that stages multimodal
reasoning as a ``what--where--reweight'' cascade. Queries are first anchored to
candidate referents via open-vocabulary detection (what), then spatially
resolved with SAM-derived masks to recover fine-grained precision (where), and
adaptively prioritized through the trade-off between local and global alignment
(reweight). Mask-guided fine-tuning further injects spatial evidence into the
generation process, transforming grounding from a passive bias into an explicit
constraint on answer formulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this
human-like cascade improves grounding fidelity and factual consistency while
reducing hallucinations, advancing multimodal question answering toward
trustworthy reasoning.

Abstract: 6D pose estimation of textureless objects is valuable for industrial robotic
applications, yet remains challenging due to the frequent loss of depth
information. Current multi-view methods either rely on depth data or
insufficiently exploit multi-view geometric cues, limiting their performance.
In this paper, we propose DKPMV, a pipeline that achieves dense keypoint-level
fusion using only multi-view RGB images as input. We design a three-stage
progressive pose optimization strategy that leverages dense multi-view keypoint
geometry information. To enable effective dense keypoint fusion, we enhance the
keypoint network with attentional aggregation and symmetry-aware training,
improving prediction accuracy and resolving ambiguities on symmetric objects.
Extensive experiments on the ROBI dataset demonstrate that DKPMV outperforms
state-of-the-art multi-view RGB approaches and even surpasses the RGB-D methods
in the majority of cases. The code will be available soon.

Conclusion: CoDeGraph在零样本异常检测中表现出色，且对不同骨干网络具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Zero-shot image anomaly classification (AC) and segmentation (AS) are vital
for industrial quality control, detecting defects without prior training data.
Existing representation-based methods compare patch features with nearest
neighbors in unlabeled test images but struggle with consistent anomalies --
similar defects recurring across multiple images -- resulting in poor AC/AS
performance. We introduce Consistent-Anomaly Detection Graph (CoDeGraph), a
novel algorithm that identifies and filters consistent anomalies from
similarity computations. Our key insight is that normal patches in industrial
images show stable, gradually increasing similarity to other test images, while
consistent-anomaly patches exhibit abrupt similarity spikes after exhausting a
limited set of similar matches, a phenomenon we term ``neighbor-burnout.''
CoDeGraph constructs an image-level graph, with images as nodes and edges
connecting those with shared consistent-anomaly patterns, using community
detection to filter these anomalies. We provide a theoretical foundation using
Extreme Value Theory to explain the effectiveness of our approach. Experiments
on MVTec AD with the ViT-L-14-336 backbone achieve 98.3% AUROC for AC and AS
performance of 66.8% (+4.2%) F1 and 68.1% (+5.4%) AP over state-of-the-art
zero-shot methods. Using the DINOv2 backbone further improves segmentation,
yielding 69.1% (+6.5%) F1 and 71.9% (+9.2%) AP, demonstrating robustness across
architectures.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability
(IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness
of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are
flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in
disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group
decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative
decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert
Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a
unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently
generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method
achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11%
and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal
instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and
trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.

Abstract: Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is an established
procedure for portal hypertension, but provides variable survival outcomes and
frequent overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), indicating the necessity of
accurate preoperative prognostic modeling. Current studies typically build
machine learning models from preoperative CT images or clinical
characteristics, but face three key challenges: (1) labor-intensive
region-of-interest (ROI) annotation, (2) poor reliability and generalizability
of unimodal methods, and (3) incomplete assessment from single-endpoint
prediction. Moreover, the lack of publicly accessible datasets constrains
research in this field. Therefore, we present MultiTIPS, the first public
multi-center dataset for TIPS prognosis, and propose a novel multimodal
prognostic framework based on it. The framework comprises three core modules:
(1) dual-option segmentation, which integrates semi-supervised and foundation
model-based pipelines to achieve robust ROI segmentation with limited
annotations and facilitate subsequent feature extraction; (2) multimodal
interaction, where three techniques, multi-grained radiomics attention (MGRA),
progressive orthogonal disentanglement (POD), and clinically guided prognostic
enhancement (CGPE), are introduced to enable cross-modal feature interaction
and complementary representation integration, thus improving model accuracy and
robustness; and (3) multi-task prediction, where a staged training strategy is
used to perform stable optimization of survival, portal pressure gradient
(PPG), and OHE prediction for comprehensive prognostic assessment. Extensive
experiments on MultiTIPS demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method
over state-of-the-art approaches, along with strong cross-domain generalization
and interpretability, indicating its promise for clinical application. The
dataset and code are available.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown solid ability for multimodal
understanding of both visual and language contexts. However, existing VLMs
often face severe challenges of hallucinations, meaning that VLMs tend to
generate responses that are only fluent in the language but irrelevant to
images in previous contexts. To address this issue, we analyze how language
bias contributes to hallucinations and then introduce Cross-Modal
Guidance(CMG), a training-free decoding method that addresses the
hallucinations by leveraging the difference between the output distributions of
the original model and the one with degraded visual-language attention. In
practice, we adaptively mask the attention weight of the most influential image
tokens in selected transformer layers to corrupt the visual-language perception
as a concrete type of degradation. Such a degradation-induced decoding
emphasizes the perception of visual contexts and therefore significantly
reduces language bias without harming the ability of VLMs. In experiment
sections, we conduct comprehensive studies. All results demonstrate the
superior advantages of CMG with neither additional conditions nor training
costs. We also quantitatively show CMG can improve different VLM's performance
on hallucination-specific benchmarks and generalize effectively.

TL;DR: DAGLFNet是一种基于伪图像的语义分割框架，通过全局-局部特征融合和多分支特征提取提升点云数据的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 点云数据的非结构化和语义细节提取困难，现有方法在特征融合和区分性上表现不足。

Method: 采用全局-局部特征融合编码模块、多分支特征提取网络和深度特征引导注意力机制。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和nuScenes验证集上分别达到69.83%和78.65%的准确率。

Conclusion: DAGLFNet在性能和实时性上取得平衡，适用于LiDAR实时应用。

Abstract: Environmental perception systems play a critical role in high-precision
mapping and autonomous navigation, with LiDAR serving as a core sensor that
provides accurate 3D point cloud data. How to efficiently process unstructured
point clouds while extracting structured semantic information remains a
significant challenge, and in recent years, numerous pseudo-image-based
representation methods have emerged to achieve a balance between efficiency and
performance. However, they often overlook the structural and semantic details
of point clouds, resulting in limited feature fusion and discriminability. In
this work, we propose DAGLFNet, a pseudo-image-based semantic segmentation
framework designed to extract discriminative features. First, the Global-Local
Feature Fusion Encoding module is used to enhance the correlation among local
features within a set and capture global contextual information. Second, the
Multi-Branch Feature Extraction network is employed to capture more
neighborhood information and enhance the discriminability of contour features.
Finally, a Feature Fusion via Deep Feature-guided Attention mechanism is
introduced to improve the precision of cross-channel feature fusion.
Experimental evaluations show that DAGLFNet achieves 69.83\% and 78.65\% on the
validation sets of SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, respectively. The method
balances high performance with real-time capability, demonstrating great
potential for LiDAR-based real-time applications.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MSF-Mamba的模型，通过融合局部时空上下文和运动感知设计，解决了微手势识别中长距离和局部依赖建模的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微手势识别需要同时建模长距离和局部时空依赖，但现有方法（如CNN和Transformer）各有局限。Mamba虽高效但缺乏局部建模能力，且缺乏运动感知设计。

Method: 提出MSF-Mamba，通过中央帧差分（CFD）设计运动感知状态融合模块，增强局部时空建模。还提出多尺度版本MSF-Mamba+，动态加权不同尺度的融合状态。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上，MSF-Mamba的轻量级版本即达到SoTA性能，优于CNN、Transformer和SSM模型，且保持高效。

Conclusion: MSF-Mamba通过运动感知和局部时空建模，有效解决了微手势识别的关键挑战，兼具高性能和效率。

Abstract: Micro-gesture recognition (MGR) targets the identification of subtle and
fine-grained human motions and requires accurate modeling of both long-range
and local spatiotemporal dependencies. While CNNs are effective at capturing
local patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited
receptive fields. Transformer-based models address this limitation through
self-attention mechanisms but suffer from high computational costs. Recently,
Mamba has shown promise as an efficient model, leveraging state space models
(SSMs) to enable linear-time processing However, directly applying the vanilla
Mamba to MGR may not be optimal. This is because Mamba processes inputs as 1D
sequences, with state updates relying solely on the previous state, and thus
lacks the ability to model local spatiotemporal dependencies. In addition,
previous methods lack a design of motion-awareness, which is crucial in MGR. To
overcome these limitations, we propose motion-aware state fusion mamba
(MSF-Mamba), which enhances Mamba with local spatiotemporal modeling by fusing
local contextual neighboring states. Our design introduces a motion-aware state
fusion module based on central frame difference (CFD). Furthermore, a
multiscale version named MSF-Mamba+ has been proposed. Specifically, MSF-Mamba
supports multiscale motion-aware state fusion, as well as an adaptive scale
weighting module that dynamically weighs the fused states across different
scales. These enhancements explicitly address the limitations of vanilla Mamba
by enabling motion-aware local spatiotemporal modeling, allowing MSF-Mamba and
MSF-Mamba to effectively capture subtle motion cues for MGR. Experiments on two
public MGR datasets demonstrate that even the lightweight version, namely,
MSF-Mamba, achieves SoTA performance, outperforming existing CNN-,
Transformer-, and SSM-based models while maintaining high efficiency.

TL;DR: 该研究验证了视觉语言模型（VLMs）具备自我优化能力，无需外部监督即可生成高质量数据并自主学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索无监督训练的VLMs潜力，验证其自我优化能力。

Method: 提出基于三角一致性原则的自我优化框架，包括多任务指令调优、数据生成与过滤、模型更新。

Result: 实验表明，模型在无外部监督下能实现稳定但有限的性能提升。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs的自我优化机制，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) integrate visual knowledge with the analytical
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through supervised visual
instruction tuning, using image-question-answer triplets. However, the
potential of VLMs trained without supervised instruction remains largely
unexplored. This study validates that VLMs possess inherent self-refinement
capabilities, enabling them to generate high-quality supervised data without
external inputs and thereby learn autonomously. Specifically, to stimulate the
self-refinement ability of VLMs, we propose a self-refinement framework based
on a Triangular Consistency principle: within the image-query-answer triangle,
any masked elements should be consistently and accurately reconstructed. The
framework involves three steps: (1) We enable the instruction generation
ability of VLMs by adding multi-task instruction tuning like
image$\rightarrow$question-answer or image-answer$\rightarrow$question. (2) We
generate image-query-answer triplets from unlabeled images and use the
Triangular Consistency principle for filtering. (3) The model is further
updated using the filtered synthetic data. To investigate the underlying
mechanisms behind this self-refinement capability, we conduct a theoretical
analysis from a causal perspective. Using the widely recognized LLaVA-1.5 as
our baseline, our experiments reveal that the model can autonomously achieve
consistent, though deliberately modest, improvements across multiple benchmarks
without any external supervision, such as human annotations or environmental
feedback. We expect that the insights of this study on the self-refinement
ability of VLMs can inspire future research on the learning mechanism of VLMs.

TL;DR: HARoPE是一种改进的RoPE方法，通过可学习的线性变换增强位置编码能力，适用于图像生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RoPE在多维数据（如图像生成）中存在局限性，如空间关系建模不足、颜色线索和对象计数问题。

Method: 提出HARoPE，通过SVD参数化的线性变换动态调整频率分配和语义对齐，保留RoPE的相对位置特性。

Result: 在ImageNet和文本到图像生成任务中，HARoPE表现优于RoPE基线和其他扩展方法。

Conclusion: HARoPE是一种轻量级且有效的改进方案，可提升基于Transformer的图像生成模型的位置感知能力。

Abstract: Transformers rely on explicit positional encoding to model structure in data.
While Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D domains, its application to
image generation reveals significant limitations such as fine-grained spatial
relation modeling, color cues, and object counting. This paper identifies key
limitations of standard multi-dimensional RoPE-rigid frequency allocation,
axis-wise independence, and uniform head treatment-in capturing the complex
structural biases required for fine-grained image generation. We propose
HARoPE, a head-wise adaptive extension that inserts a learnable linear
transformation parameterized via singular value decomposition (SVD) before the
rotary mapping. This lightweight modification enables dynamic frequency
reallocation, semantic alignment of rotary planes, and head-specific positional
receptive fields while rigorously preserving RoPE's relative-position property.
Extensive experiments on class-conditional ImageNet and text-to-image
generation (Flux and MMDiT) demonstrate that HARoPE consistently improves
performance over strong RoPE baselines and other extensions. The method serves
as an effective drop-in replacement, offering a principled and adaptable
solution for enhancing positional awareness in transformer-based image
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Jigsaw3D提出了一种基于多视角扩散的3D风格迁移方法，通过解耦风格与内容，实现快速且视角一致的风格化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖直接注入风格标记或2D扩散模型的分数蒸馏，导致计算开销大且风格与语义内容纠缠。

Method: 利用拼图操作（空间打乱和随机掩码参考图像块）抑制对象语义并提取风格统计信息，通过跨注意力机制将风格融入多视角扩散模型。

Result: 在标准3D风格化基准测试中，Jigsaw3D实现了高风格保真度和多视角一致性，且延迟显著降低。

Conclusion: Jigsaw3D能够高效处理3D风格迁移任务，并支持部分参考风格化、多对象场景风格化和可平铺纹理生成。

Abstract: Controllable 3D style transfer seeks to restyle a 3D asset so that its
textures match a reference image while preserving the integrity and multi-view
consistency. The prevalent methods either rely on direct reference style token
injection or score-distillation from 2D diffusion models, which incurs heavy
per-scene optimization and often entangles style with semantic content. We
introduce Jigsaw3D, a multi-view diffusion based pipeline that decouples style
from content and enables fast, view-consistent stylization. Our key idea is to
leverage the jigsaw operation - spatial shuffling and random masking of
reference patches - to suppress object semantics and isolate stylistic
statistics (color palettes, strokes, textures). We integrate these style cues
into a multi-view diffusion model via reference-to-view cross-attention,
producing view-consistent stylized renderings conditioned on the input mesh.
The renders are then style-baked onto the surface to yield seamless textures.
Across standard 3D stylization benchmarks, Jigsaw3D achieves high style
fidelity and multi-view consistency with substantially lower latency, and
generalizes to masked partial reference stylization, multi-object scene
styling, and tileable texture generation. Project page is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态奖励模型在处理视觉输入时存在上下文预算限制和幻觉问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出VR-Thinker框架，结合视觉推理操作和强化微调流程（冷启动、拒绝采样微调、GRPO）。

Result: 在多个视频偏好基准测试中达到最优性能，如VideoGen Reward（80.5%）。

Conclusion: VR-Thinker验证了结合视觉推理的多模态奖励建模的有效性和潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in multimodal reward models (RMs) have substantially
improved post-training for visual generative models. However, current RMs face
inherent limitations: (1) visual inputs consume large context budgets, forcing
fewer frames and causing loss of fine-grained details; and (2) all visual
information is packed into the initial prompt, exacerbating hallucination and
forgetting during chain-of-thought reasoning. To overcome these issues, we
introduce VideoReward Thinker (VR-Thinker), a thinking-with-image framework
that equips the RM with visual reasoning operations (e.g., select frame) and a
configurable visual memory window. This allows the RM to actively acquire and
update visual evidence within context limits, improving reasoning fidelity and
reliability. We activate visual reasoning via a reinforcement fine-tuning
pipeline: (i) Cold Start with curated visual chain-of-thought data to distill
basic reasoning skills and operation formatting; (ii) select samples whose
per-dimension and overall judgments are all correct, then conduct Rejection
sampling Fine-Tuning on these high-quality traces to further enhance reasoning;
and (iii) apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen
reasoning. Our approach delivers state-of-the-art accuracy among open-source
models on video preference benchmarks, especially for longer videos: a 7B
VR-Thinker achieves 80.5% on VideoGen Reward, 82.3% on GenAI-Bench, and 75.6%
on MJ-Bench-Video. These results validate the effectiveness and promise of
thinking-with-image multimodal reward modeling.

Motivation: 现有LUT方法因表大小限制导致感受野受限，影响性能。

Result: 显著提升LUT方法的性能，平衡速度、准确性和内存效率。

Conclusion: 新方法在固定表大小下扩展感受野，优于现有LUT技术。

Abstract: Recently, several look-up table (LUT) methods were developed to greatly
expedite the inference of CNNs in a classical strategy of trading space for
speed. However, these LUT methods suffer from a common drawback of limited
receptive field of the convolution kernels due to the combinatorial explosion
of table size. This research aims to expand the CNN receptive field with a
fixed table size, thereby enhancing the performance of LUT-driven fast CNN
inference while maintaining the same space complexity. To achieve this goal,
various techniques are proposed. The main contribution is a novel approach of
learning an optimal lattice vector quantizer that adaptively allocates the
quantization resolution across data dimensions based on their significance to
the inference task. In addition, the lattice vector quantizer offers an
inherently more accurate approximation of CNN kernels than scalar quantizer as
used in current practice. Furthermore, we introduce other receptive field
expansion strategies, including irregular dilated convolutions and a U-shaped
cascaded LUT structure, designed to capture multi-level contextual information
without inflating table size. Together, these innovations allow our approach to
effectively balance speed, accuracy, and memory efficiency, demonstrating
significant improvements over existing LUT methods.

Abstract: In this work, we present COSINE, a unified open-world segmentation model that
consolidates open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context segmentation with
multi-modal prompts (e.g., text and image). COSINE exploits foundation models
to extract representations for an input image and corresponding multi-modal
prompts, and a SegDecoder to align these representations, model their
interaction, and obtain masks specified by input prompts across different
granularities. In this way, COSINE overcomes architectural discrepancies,
divergent learning objectives, and distinct representation learning strategies
of previous pipelines for open-vocabulary segmentation and in-context
segmentation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that COSINE has significant
performance improvements in both open-vocabulary and in-context segmentation
tasks. Our exploratory analyses highlight that the synergistic collaboration
between using visual and textual prompts leads to significantly improved
generalization over single-modality approaches.

Conclusion: 通过嵌入模式分析，结合计算机视觉和语言建模，提升了智能交通和监控应用的适应性。

Abstract: This work presents a pattern-aware framework for automatic license plate
recognition (ALPR), designed to operate reliably across diverse plate layouts
and challenging real-world conditions. The proposed system consists of a
modern, high-precision detection network followed by a recognition stage that
integrates a transformer-based vision model with an iterative language
modelling mechanism. This unified recognition stage performs character
identification and post-OCR refinement in a seamless process, learning the
structural patterns and formatting rules specific to license plates without
relying on explicit heuristic corrections or manual layout classification.
Through this design, the system jointly optimizes visual and linguistic cues,
enables iterative refinement to improve OCR accuracy under noise, distortion,
and unconventional fonts, and achieves layout-independent recognition across
multiple international datasets (IR-LPR, UFPR-ALPR, AOLP). Experimental results
demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to recent
segmentation-free approaches, highlighting how embedding pattern analysis
within the recognition stage bridges computer vision and language modelling for
enhanced adaptability in intelligent transportation and surveillance
applications.

Result: 在四个多模态基准测试中，MCE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MCE有效解决了多模态学习中的缺失和不平衡问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal learning has made significant advances across diverse pattern
recognition applications. However, handling missing modalities, especially
under imbalanced missing rates, remains a major challenge. This imbalance
triggers a vicious cycle: modalities with higher missing rates receive fewer
updates, leading to inconsistent learning progress and representational
degradation that further diminishes their contribution. Existing methods
typically focus on global dataset-level balancing, often overlooking critical
sample-level variations in modality utility and the underlying issue of
degraded feature quality. We propose Modality Capability Enhancement (MCE) to
tackle these limitations. MCE includes two synergistic components: i) Learning
Capability Enhancement (LCE), which introduces multi-level factors to
dynamically balance modality-specific learning progress, and ii) Representation
Capability Enhancement (RCE), which improves feature semantics and robustness
through subset prediction and cross-modal completion tasks. Comprehensive
evaluations on four multi-modal benchmarks show that MCE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods under various missing configurations. The

Result: 揭示了季节性冰川速度周期、长期变暖趋势（每十年约0.8 K）以及冰冻圈条件的空间异质性。

Conclusion: GLOFNet为罕见灾害预测的多模态深度学习方法提供了结构化基准数据集。

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are rare but destructive hazards in high
mountain regions, yet predictive research is hindered by fragmented and
unimodal data. Most prior efforts emphasize post-event mapping, whereas
forecasting requires harmonized datasets that combine visual indicators with
physical precursors. We present GLOFNet, a multimodal dataset for GLOF
monitoring and prediction, focused on the Shisper Glacier in the Karakoram. It
integrates three complementary sources: Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery for
spatial monitoring, NASA ITS_LIVE velocity products for glacier kinematics, and
MODIS Land Surface Temperature records spanning over two decades. Preprocessing
included cloud masking, quality filtering, normalization, temporal
interpolation, augmentation, and cyclical encoding, followed by harmonization
across modalities. Exploratory analysis reveals seasonal glacier velocity
cycles, long-term warming of ~0.8 K per decade, and spatial heterogeneity in
cryospheric conditions. The resulting dataset, GLOFNet, is publicly available
to support future research in glacial hazard prediction. By addressing
challenges such as class imbalance, cloud contamination, and coarse resolution,
GLOFNet provides a structured foundation for benchmarking multimodal deep
learning approaches to rare hazard prediction.

Abstract: Aiming at the problems of missed detection, false detection and low detection
efficiency in transmission line foreign object detection under railway
environment, we proposed an improved algorithm MRS-YOLO based on YOLO11.
Firstly, a multi-scale Adaptive Kernel Depth Feature Fusion (MAKDF) module is
proposed and fused with the C3k2 module to form C3k2_MAKDF, which enhances the
model's feature extraction capability for foreign objects of different sizes
and shapes. Secondly, a novel Re-calibration Feature Fusion Pyramid Network
(RCFPN) is designed as a neck structure to enhance the model's ability to
integrate and utilize multi-level features effectively. Then, Spatial and
Channel Reconstruction Detect Head (SC_Detect) based on spatial and channel
preprocessing is designed to enhance the model's overall detection performance.
Finally, the channel pruning technique is used to reduce the redundancy of the
improved model, drastically reduce Parameters and Giga Floating Point
Operations Per Second (GFLOPs), and improve the detection efficiency. The
experimental results show that the mAP50 and mAP50:95 of the MRS-YOLO algorithm
proposed in this paper are improved to 94.8% and 86.4%, respectively, which are
0.7 and 2.3 percentage points higher compared to the baseline, while Parameters

that the improved algorithm can be better applied to the task of foreign object
detection in railroad transmission lines.

Abstract: Weed species classification represents an important step for the development
of automated targeting systems that allow the adoption of precision agriculture
practices. To reduce costs and yield losses caused by their presence. The
identification of weeds is a challenging problem due to their shared
similarities with crop plants and the variability related to the differences in
terms of their types. Along with the variations in relation to changes in field
conditions. Moreover, to fully benefit from deep learning-based methods, large
fully annotated datasets are needed. This requires time intensive and laborious
process for data labeling, which represents a limitation in agricultural
applications. Hence, for the aim of improving the utilization of the unlabeled
data, regarding conditions of scarcity in terms of the labeled data available
during the learning phase and provide robust and high classification
performance. We propose a deep semi-supervised approach, that combines
consistency regularization with similarity learning. Through our developed deep
auto-encoder architecture, experiments realized on the DeepWeeds dataset and
inference in noisy conditions demonstrated the effectiveness and robustness of
our method in comparison to state-of-the-art fully supervised deep learning
models. Furthermore, we carried out ablation studies for an extended analysis
of our proposed joint learning strategy.

Abstract: Tokenizer is a crucial component for both visual understanding and
generation. To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent
research has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing
tokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and
generation, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic
abstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we
propose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting
any visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we
introduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained
visual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong
semantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model
fine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight
patch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel
reconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the
patch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual
conditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts
between understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning
strategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training
efficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7
widely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that
UniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only
surpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,
but also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and
generation, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without
guidance), respectively.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于扩散模型的光流估计框架Diff-ABFlow，结合帧-事件相机的优势，解决高速和低光场景下的光流估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速和低光场景下，传统光流估计因运动模糊和光照不足导致纹理减弱、噪声增加，影响特征匹配。帧相机和事件相机各有优劣，但现有方法未能充分利用两者的互补性。

Method: 提出Diff-ABFlow框架，利用扩散模型学习从噪声光流到清晰光流的映射，结合帧相机的外观饱和度和事件相机的边界完整性。

Result: 通过扩散模型避免了传统方法因视觉特征退化带来的影响，提升了光流估计的准确性。

Conclusion: Diff-ABFlow在高速和低光场景下表现出色，为光流估计提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Optical flow estimation has achieved promising results in conventional scenes
but faces challenges in high-speed and low-light scenes, which suffer from
motion blur and insufficient illumination. These conditions lead to weakened
texture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and
boundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature
matching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance
saturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and
low dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance
saturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to
dense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature
fusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary
completeness. However, the appearance features are still deteriorated, which
severely affects the mostly adopted discriminative models that learn the
mapping from visual features to motion fields and generative models that
generate motion fields based on given visual features. So we introduce
diffusion models that learn the mapping from noising flow to clear flow, which
is not affected by the deteriorated visual features. Therefore, we propose a
novel optical flow estimation framework Diff-ABFlow based on diffusion models
with frame-event appearance-boundary fusion.

Motivation: 探索预训练视觉基础模型在OOD检测中的潜力，并解决其在大语义空间中的性能瓶颈。

Method: 使用DINOv2模型进行OOD检测，提出MoFE模块分割特征空间，以及Dynamic-β Mixup策略优化特征学习。

Result: DINOv2无需微调即可媲美SOTA方法；MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup显著提升大语义空间下的性能。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉基础模型在OOD检测中具有潜力，MoFE和Dynamic-β Mixup有效解决了大语义空间的挑战。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision foundation models have transformed many computer vision
tasks. Despite their strong ability to learn discriminative and generalizable
features crucial for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, their impact on this
task remains underexplored. Motivated by this gap, we systematically
investigate representative vision foundation models for OOD detection. Our
findings reveal that a pre-trained DINOv2 model, even without fine-tuning on
in-domain (ID) data, naturally provides a highly discriminative feature space
for OOD detection, achieving performance comparable to existing
state-of-the-art methods without requiring complex designs. Beyond this, we
explore how fine-tuning foundation models on in-domain (ID) data can enhance
OOD detection. However, we observe that the performance of vision foundation
models remains unsatisfactory in scenarios with a large semantic space. This is
due to the increased complexity of decision boundaries as the number of
categories grows, which complicates the optimization process. To mitigate this,
we propose the Mixture of Feature Experts (MoFE) module, which partitions
features into subspaces, effectively capturing complex data distributions and
refining decision boundaries. Further, we introduce a Dynamic-$\beta$ Mixup
strategy, which samples interpolation weights from a dynamic beta distribution.
This adapts to varying levels of learning difficulty across categories,
improving feature learning for more challenging categories. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, significantly
outperforming baseline methods.

*Jingchao Wang,Wenlong Zhang,Dingjiang Huang,Hong Wang,Yefeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于特征选择的视觉定位基线方法FSVG，简化了复杂的迭代过程，提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在迭代过程中需要存储语言和视觉特征，导致额外开销，FSVG旨在简化实现并提高效率。

Method: 通过将语言和视觉模态直接封装到网络架构中，并引入相似性特征选择机制，减少计算成本。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上验证了FSVG在准确性和效率上的平衡优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FSVG是一种简单有效的视觉定位方法，显著提升了效率和性能。

Abstract: Visual grounding aims to predict the locations of target objects specified by
textual descriptions. For this task with linguistic and visual modalities,
there is a latest research line that focuses on only selecting the
linguistic-relevant visual regions for object localization to reduce the
computational overhead. Albeit achieving impressive performance, it is
iteratively performed on different image scales, and at every iteration,
linguistic features and visual features need to be stored in a cache, incurring
extra overhead. To facilitate the implementation, in this paper, we propose a
feature selection-based simple yet effective baseline for visual grounding,
called FSVG. Specifically, we directly encapsulate the linguistic and visual
modalities into an overall network architecture without complicated iterative
procedures, and utilize the language in parallel as guidance to facilitate the
interaction between linguistic modal and visual modal for extracting effective
visual features. Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost, during the
visual feature learning, we introduce a similarity-based feature selection
mechanism to only exploit language-related visual features for faster
prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets
comprehensively substantiate that the proposed FSVG achieves a better balance
between accuracy and efficiency beyond the current state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ViSurf是一种结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RLVR）优势的单阶段后训练范式，通过注入真实标签和优化奖励策略提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFT和RLVR各有局限性，SFT性能次优，RLVR难以处理超出模型知识库的任务。

Method: 提出ViSurf，整合SFT和RLVR目标，注入真实标签并引入三种奖励控制策略。

Result: ViSurf在多个基准测试中表现优于SFT、RLVR及两阶段方法。

Conclusion: ViSurf通过统一视角和优化设计，有效解决了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: Typical post-training paradigms for Large Vision-and-Language Models (LVLMs)
include Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable
Rewards (RLVR). SFT leverages external guidance to inject new knowledge,
whereas RLVR utilizes internal reinforcement to enhance reasoning capabilities
and overall performance. However, our analysis reveals that SFT often leads to
sub-optimal performance, while RLVR struggles with tasks that exceed the
model's internal knowledge base. To address these limitations, we propose
ViSurf (\textbf{Vi}sual \textbf{Su}pervised-and-\textbf{R}einforcement
\textbf{F}ine-Tuning), a unified post-training paradigm that integrates the
strengths of both SFT and RLVR within a single stage. We analyze the derivation
of the SFT and RLVR objectives to establish the ViSurf objective, providing a
unified perspective on these two paradigms. The core of ViSurf involves
injecting ground-truth labels into the RLVR rollouts, thereby providing
simultaneous external supervision and internal reinforcement. Furthermore, we
introduce three novel reward control strategies to stabilize and optimize the
training process. Extensive experiments across several diverse benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of ViSurf, outperforming both individual SFT,
RLVR, and two-stage SFT \textrightarrow RLVR. In-depth analysis corroborates
these findings, validating the derivation and design principles of ViSurf.

Result: 在三种IQA任务（美学质量、技术质量和图文对齐）上表现优异。

Conclusion: OmniQuality-R通过多维度推理和稳定训练机制，实现了高效的多任务质量评估。

Abstract: Current visual evaluation approaches are typically constrained to a single
task. To address this, we propose OmniQuality-R, a unified reward modeling
framework that transforms multi-task quality reasoning into continuous and
interpretable reward signals for policy optimization. Inspired by subjective
experiments, where participants are given task-specific instructions outlining
distinct assessment principles prior to evaluation, we propose OmniQuality-R, a
structured reward modeling framework that transforms multi-dimensional
reasoning into continuous and interpretable reward signals. To enable this, we
construct a reasoning-enhanced reward modeling dataset by sampling informative
plan-reason trajectories via rejection sampling, forming a reliable
chain-of-thought (CoT) dataset for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Building on
this, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) for post-training,
using a Gaussian-based reward to support continuous score prediction. To
further stabilize the training and improve downstream generalization, we
incorporate standard deviation (STD) filtering and entropy gating mechanisms
during reinforcement learning. These techniques suppress unstable updates and
reduce variance in policy optimization. We evaluate OmniQuality-R on three key
IQA tasks: aesthetic quality assessment, technical quality evaluation, and
text-image alignment.

Result: 在多种图基准测试中，该方法在保持线性注意力可扩展性的同时，实现了竞争性的性能。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了线性注意力模型的局限性，提升了节点表示的可分离性和分类能力。

Abstract: Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to full
self-attention in Graph Transformers, offering linear time complexity. However,
existing linear attention models often suffer from a significant drop in
expressiveness due to low-rank projection structures and overly uniform
attention distributions. We theoretically prove that these properties reduce
the class separability of node representations, limiting the model's
classification ability. To address this, we propose a novel hybrid framework
that enhances both the rank and focus of attention. Specifically, we enhance
linear attention by attaching a gated local graph network branch to the value
matrix, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting attention map.
Furthermore, to alleviate the excessive smoothing effect inherent in linear
attention, we introduce a learnable log-power function into the attention
scores to reduce entropy and sharpen focus. We theoretically show that this
function decreases entropy in the attention distribution, enhancing the
separability of learned embeddings. Extensive experiments on both homophilic
and heterophilic graph benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
competitive performance while preserving the scalability of linear attention.

Abstract: Audio-driven talking-head generation has advanced rapidly with
diffusion-based generative models, yet producing temporally coherent videos
with fine-grained motion control remains challenging. We propose DEMO, a
flow-matching generative framework for audio-driven talking-portrait video
synthesis that delivers disentangled, high-fidelity control of lip motion, head
pose, and eye gaze. The core contribution is a motion auto-encoder that builds
a structured latent space in which motion factors are independently represented
and approximately orthogonalized. On this disentangled motion space, we apply
optimal-transport-based flow matching with a transformer predictor to generate
temporally smooth motion trajectories conditioned on audio. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DEMO outperforms prior methods
in video realism, lip-audio synchronization, and motion fidelity. These results
demonstrate that combining fine-grained motion disentanglement with flow-based
generative modeling provides a powerful new paradigm for controllable
talking-head video synthesis.

Abstract: For high-stakes applications, like autonomous driving, a safe operation is
necessary to prevent harm, accidents, and failures. Traditionally, difficult
scenarios have been categorized into corner cases and addressed individually.
However, this example-based categorization is not scalable and lacks a data
coverage perspective, neglecting the generalization to training data of machine
learning models. In our work, we propose a novel machine learning approach that
takes the underlying data distribution into account. Based on our novel
perspective, we present a framework for effective corner case recognition for
perception on individual samples. In our evaluation, we show that our approach
(i) unifies existing scenario-based corner case taxonomies under a
distributional perspective, (ii) achieves strong performance on corner case
detection tasks across standard benchmarks for which we extend established
out-of-distribution detection benchmarks, and (iii) enables analysis of
combined corner cases via a newly introduced fog-augmented Lost & Found
dataset. These results provide a principled basis for corner case recognition,

Abstract: As one of the fundamental modules in autonomous driving, online
high-definition (HD) maps have attracted significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and real-time capabilities. Since vehicles always cruise in
highly dynamic environments, spatial displacement of onboard sensors inevitably
causes shifts in real-time HD mapping results, and such instability poses
fundamental challenges for downstream tasks. However, existing online map
construction models tend to prioritize improving each frame's mapping accuracy,
while the mapping stability has not yet been systematically studied. To fill
this gap, this paper presents the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
the temporal stability of online HD mapping models. We propose a
multi-dimensional stability evaluation framework with novel metrics for
Presence, Localization, and Shape Stability, integrated into a unified mean
Average Stability (mAS) score. Extensive experiments on 42 models and variants
show that accuracy (mAP) and stability (mAS) represent largely independent
performance dimensions. We further analyze the impact of key model design
choices on both criteria, identifying architectural and training factors that
contribute to high accuracy, high stability, or both. To encourage broader
focus on stability, we will release a public benchmark. Our work highlights the
importance of treating temporal stability as a core evaluation criterion
alongside accuracy, advancing the development of more reliable autonomous
driving systems. The benchmark toolkit, code, and models will be available at

Conclusion: FS-VFM是一个通用的人脸视觉基础模型，能够显著提升下游任务的性能，且FS-Adapter进一步优化了效率。

Abstract: With abundant, unlabeled real faces, how can we learn robust and transferable
facial representations to boost generalization across various face security
tasks? We make the first attempt and propose FS-VFM, a scalable self-supervised
pre-training framework, to learn fundamental representations of real face
images. We introduce three learning objectives, namely 3C, that synergize
masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID), empowering FS-VFM
to encode both local patterns and global semantics of real faces. Specifically,
we formulate various facial masking strategies for MIM and devise a simple yet
effective CRFR-P masking, which explicitly prompts the model to pursue
meaningful intra-region Consistency and challenging inter-region Coherency. We
present a reliable self-distillation mechanism that seamlessly couples MIM with
ID to establish underlying local-to-global Correspondence. After pre-training,
vanilla vision transformers (ViTs) serve as universal Vision Foundation Models
for downstream Face Security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection,
cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forensics. To
efficiently transfer the pre-trained FS-VFM, we further propose FS-Adapter, a
lightweight plug-and-play bottleneck atop the frozen backbone with a novel
real-anchor contrastive objective. Extensive experiments on 11 public
benchmarks demonstrate that our FS-VFM consistently generalizes better than
diverse VFMs, spanning natural and facial domains, fully, weakly, and
self-supervised paradigms, small, base, and large ViT scales, and even
outperforms SOTA task-specific methods, while FS-Adapter offers an excellent
efficiency-performance trade-off. The code and models are available on

Abstract: Recent Text-to-Video (T2V) models have demonstrated powerful capability in
visual simulation of real-world geometry and physical laws, indicating its
potential as implicit world models. Inspired by this, we explore the
feasibility of leveraging the video generation prior for viewpoint planning
from given 4D scenes, since videos internally accompany dynamic scenes with
natural viewpoints. To this end, we propose a two-stage paradigm to adapt
pre-trained T2V models for viewpoint prediction, in a compatible manner. First,
we inject the 4D scene representation into the pre-trained T2V model via an
adaptive learning branch, where the 4D scene is viewpoint-agnostic and the
conditional generated video embeds the viewpoints visually. Then, we formulate
viewpoint extraction as a hybrid-condition guided camera extrinsic denoising
process. Specifically, a camera extrinsic diffusion branch is further
introduced onto the pre-trained T2V model, by taking the generated video and 4D
scene as input. Experimental results show the superiority of our proposed
method over existing competitors, and ablation studies validate the
effectiveness of our key technical designs. To some extent, this work proves
the potential of video generation models toward 4D interaction in real world.

Abstract: Image-Language Foundation Models (ILFM) have demonstrated remarkable success
in image-text understanding/generation tasks, providing transferable multimodal
representations that generalize across diverse downstream image-based tasks.
The advancement of video-text research has spurred growing interest in
extending image-based models to the video domain. This paradigm, known as
image-to-video transfer learning, succeeds in alleviating the substantial data
and computational requirements associated with training video-language
foundation models from scratch for video-text learning. This survey provides
the first comprehensive review of this emerging field, which begins by
summarizing the widely used ILFM and their capabilities. We then systematically
classify existing image-to-video transfer learning strategies into two
categories: frozen features and modified features, depending on whether the
original representations from ILFM are preserved or undergo modifications.
Building upon the task-specific nature of image-to-video transfer, this survey
methodically elaborates these strategies and details their applications across
a spectrum of video-text learning tasks, ranging from fine-grained (e.g.,
spatio-temporal video grounding) to coarse-grained (e.g., video question
answering). We further present a detailed experimental analysis to investigate
the efficacy of different image-to-video transfer learning paradigms on a range
of downstream video understanding tasks. Finally, we identify prevailing
challenges and highlight promising directions for future research. By offering
a comprehensive and structured overview, this survey aims to establish a
structured roadmap for advancing video-text learning based on existing ILFM,
and to inspire future research directions in this rapidly evolving domain.

Abstract: Multi-modal brain tumor segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, and
it requires accurate identification of distinct internal anatomical subregions.
While the recent prompt-based segmentation paradigms enable interactive
experiences for clinicians, existing methods ignore cross-modal correlations
and rely on labor-intensive category-specific prompts, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
MSM-Seg framework for multi-modal brain tumor segmentation. The MSM-Seg
introduces a novel dual-memory segmentation paradigm that synergistically
integrates multi-modal and inter-slice information with the efficient
category-agnostic prompt for brain tumor understanding. To this end, we first
devise a modality-and-slice memory attention (MSMA) to exploit the cross-modal
and inter-slice relationships among the input scans. Then, we propose a
multi-scale category-agnostic prompt encoder (MCP-Encoder) to provide tumor
region guidance for decoding. Moreover, we devise a modality-adaptive fusion
decoder (MF-Decoder) that leverages the complementary decoding information
across different modalities to improve segmentation accuracy. Extensive
experiments on different MRI datasets demonstrate that our MSM-Seg framework
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-modal metastases and glioma tumor
segmentation. The code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/MSM-Seg.

Abstract: Action understanding, encompassing action detection and anticipation, plays a
crucial role in numerous practical applications. However, untrimmed videos are
often characterized by substantial redundant information and noise. Moreover,
in modeling action understanding, the influence of the agent's intention on the
action is often overlooked. Motivated by these issues, we propose a novel
framework called the State-Specific Model (SSM), designed to unify and enhance
both action detection and anticipation tasks. In the proposed framework, the
Critical State-Based Memory Compression module compresses frame sequences into
critical states, reducing information redundancy. The Action Pattern Learning
module constructs a state-transition graph with multi-dimensional edges to
model action dynamics in complex scenarios, on the basis of which potential
future cues can be generated to represent intention. Furthermore, our
Cross-Temporal Interaction module models the mutual influence between
intentions and past as well as current information through cross-temporal
interactions, thereby refining present and future features and ultimately
realizing simultaneous action detection and anticipation. Extensive experiments
on multiple benchmark datasets -- including EPIC-Kitchens-100, THUMOS'14,
TVSeries, and the introduced Parkinson's Disease Mouse Behaviour (PDMB) dataset
-- demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework compared to

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了散焦和运动模糊的联合处理问题，代码和模型将公开。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework that allows high-quality dynamic
Gaussian Splatting from both defocused and motion-blurred monocular videos. Due
to the significant difference between the formation processes of defocus blur
and motion blur, existing methods are tailored for either one of them, lacking
the ability to simultaneously deal with both of them. Although the two can be
jointly modeled as blur kernel-based convolution, the inherent difficulty in
estimating accurate blur kernels greatly limits the progress in this direction.
In this work, we go a step further towards this direction. Particularly, we
propose to estimate per-pixel reliable blur kernels using a blur prediction
network that exploits blur-related scene and camera information and is subject
to a blur-aware sparsity constraint. Besides, we introduce a dynamic Gaussian
densification strategy to mitigate the lack of Gaussians for incomplete
regions, and boost the performance of novel view synthesis by incorporating
unseen view information to constrain scene optimization. Extensive experiments
show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in generating
photorealistic novel view synthesis from defocused and motion-blurred monocular
videos. Our code and trained model will be made publicly available.

Abstract: We present WorldMirror, an all-in-one, feed-forward model for versatile 3D
geometric prediction tasks. Unlike existing methods constrained to image-only
inputs or customized for a specific task, our framework flexibly integrates

while simultaneously generating multiple 3D representations: dense point
clouds, multi-view depth maps, camera parameters, surface normals, and 3D
Gaussians. This elegant and unified architecture leverages available prior
information to resolve structural ambiguities and delivers geometrically
consistent 3D outputs in a single forward pass. WorldMirror achieves

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VR/AR系统需要智能适应用户行为以提升交互体验，但需准确理解人类意图和预测行为，建模认知过程是关键。

Method: 提出分层意图感知框架，结合历史动态和场景上下文，识别交互目标并预测行为，使用动态GCN捕捉关系。

Result: 在真实基准和VR环境中表现优异，所有指标均优于现有方法，支持主动适应用户行为的VR系统。

Conclusion: 该框架通过建模认知机制有效预测行为，为VR/AR系统提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: Virtual and augmented reality systems increasingly demand intelligent
adaptation to user behaviors for enhanced interaction experiences. Achieving
this requires accurately understanding human intentions and predicting future
situated behaviors - such as gaze direction and object interactions - which is
vital for creating responsive VR/AR environments and applications like
personalized assistants. However, accurate behavioral prediction demands
modeling the underlying cognitive processes that drive human-environment
interactions. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical, intention-aware
framework that models human intentions and predicts detailed situated behaviors
by leveraging cognitive mechanisms. Given historical human dynamics and the
observation of scene contexts, our framework first identifies potential
interaction targets and forecasts fine-grained future behaviors. We propose a
dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to effectively capture
human-environment relationships. Extensive experiments on challenging
real-world benchmarks and live VR environment demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, achieving superior performance across all metrics and enabling
practical applications for proactive VR systems that anticipate user behaviors
and adapt virtual environments accordingly.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于深度神经网络的视觉异常检测方法（VAD），用于自动识别水下视频中的异常事件，并引入了首个多标注者基准数据集AURA。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下视频监测是评估海洋生物多样性的有效方法，但海量无事件视频使得人工检查不切实际，因此需要自动化的异常检测技术。

Method: 研究探索了基于深度神经网络的VAD方法，并评估了四种VAD模型在两个海洋场景中的表现，强调了鲁棒帧选择策略的重要性。

Result: 实验表明，当前模型的VAD性能差异显著，且对训练数据量和“正常”场景的视觉内容变异性高度敏感。

Conclusion: 研究强调了软标签和共识标签的价值，为科学探索和可扩展的生物多样性监测提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Underwater video monitoring is a promising strategy for assessing marine
biodiversity, but the vast volume of uneventful footage makes manual inspection
highly impractical. In this work, we explore the use of visual anomaly
detection (VAD) based on deep neural networks to automatically identify
interesting or anomalous events. We introduce AURA, the first multi-annotator
benchmark dataset for underwater VAD, and evaluate four VAD models across two
marine scenes. We demonstrate the importance of robust frame selection
strategies to extract meaningful video segments. Our comparison against
multiple annotators reveals that VAD performance of current models varies
dramatically and is highly sensitive to both the amount of training data and
the variability in visual content that defines "normal" scenes. Our results
highlight the value of soft and consensus labels and offer a practical approach
for supporting scientific exploration and scalable biodiversity monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于局部感受野的面部相似性度量方法，提供可解释的决策过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有后处理方法对模型推理过程的忠实度不确定，需设计内在可解释的模型。

Method: 将全局相似性分解为局部感受野的贡献，通过累加局部相似性得分实现可解释性。

Result: 在112x112面部图像中使用28x28小块时性能接近最优，56x56小块时超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 局部可加性方法在保持性能的同时提供了内在可解释性。

Abstract: Understanding how deep neural networks make decisions is crucial for
analyzing their behavior and diagnosing failure cases. In computer vision, a
common approach to improve interpretability is to assign importance to
individual pixels using post-hoc methods. Although they are widely used to
explain black-box models, their fidelity to the model's actual reasoning is
uncertain due to the lack of reliable evaluation metrics. This limitation
motivates an alternative approach, which is to design models whose decision
processes are inherently interpretable. To this end, we propose a face
similarity metric that breaks down global similarity into contributions from
restricted receptive fields. Our method defines the similarity between two face
images as the sum of patch-level similarity scores, providing a locally
additive explanation without relying on post-hoc analysis. We show that the
proposed approach achieves competitive verification performance even with
patches as small as 28x28 within 112x112 face images, and surpasses
state-of-the-art methods when using 56x56 patches.

Abstract: Identifying drones and birds correctly is essential for keeping the skies
safe and improving security systems. Using the VIP CUP 2025 dataset, which
provides both RGB and infrared (IR) images, this study presents EGD-YOLOv8n, a
new lightweight yet powerful model for object detection. The model improves how
image features are captured and understood, making detection more accurate and
efficient. It uses smart design changes and attention layers to focus on
important details while reducing the amount of computation needed. A special
detection head helps the model adapt to objects of different shapes and sizes.
We trained three versions: one using RGB images, one using IR images, and one
combining both. The combined model achieved the best accuracy and reliability
while running fast enough for real-time use on common GPUs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着CT检查数量的增加，需要自动化工具支持放射科医生的工作。现有的3D卷积神经网络和视觉Transformer方法在长程依赖和预训练需求上存在局限性。

Method: 将3D CT体积表示为结构化图，通过谱图卷积处理轴向切片三元组作为节点，捕捉切片间依赖关系。

Result: 在三个独立机构的数据集上表现出强大的跨数据集泛化能力，性能优于现有视觉编码器。

Conclusion: 该方法在临床部署中具有潜力，并通过转移实验展示了其在放射报告生成和腹部CT数据上的广泛应用性。

Abstract: With the growing volume of CT examinations, there is an increasing demand for
automated tools such as organ segmentation, abnormality detection, and report
generation to support radiologists in managing their clinical workload.
Multi-label classification of 3D Chest CT scans remains a critical yet
challenging problem due to the complex spatial relationships inherent in
volumetric data and the wide variability of abnormalities. Existing methods
based on 3D convolutional neural networks struggle to capture long-range
dependencies, while Vision Transformers often require extensive pre-training on
large-scale, domain-specific datasets to perform competitively. In this work,
we propose a 2.5D alternative by introducing a new graph-based framework that
represents 3D CT volumes as structured graphs, where axial slice triplets serve
as nodes processed through spectral graph convolution, enabling the model to
reason over inter-slice dependencies while maintaining complexity compatible
with clinical deployment. Our method, trained and evaluated on 3 datasets from
independent institutions, achieves strong cross-dataset generalization, and
shows competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art visual encoders. We
further conduct comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the impact of
various aggregation strategies, edge-weighting schemes, and graph connectivity
patterns. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader applicability of our
approach through transfer experiments on automated radiology report generation
and abdominal CT data.\\ This work extends our previous contribution presented
at the MICCAI 2025 EMERGE Workshop.

TL;DR: 提出DISC-GAN框架，通过风格-内容解耦和聚类训练策略，实现高质量水下图像合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像合成受颜色衰减和浑浊等光学现象影响，现有生成模型难以捕捉不同水域的非均匀风格变化。

Method: 使用K-means聚类划分数据集，通过独立编码器分离风格和内容，结合AdaIN和解码器生成图像，并在每个风格簇上独立训练。

Result: 在SSIM、PSNR和FID指标上达到最优性能，SSIM为0.9012，PSNR为32.5118 dB，FID为13.3728。

Conclusion: DISC-GAN通过风格-内容解耦和聚类训练策略，有效提升了水下图像合成的真实性和多样性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Disentangled Style-Content GAN
(DISC-GAN), which integrates style-content disentanglement with a
cluster-specific training strategy towards photorealistic underwater image
synthesis. The quality of synthetic underwater images is challenged by optical
due to phenomena such as color attenuation and turbidity. These phenomena are
represented by distinct stylistic variations across different waterbodies, such
as changes in tint and haze. While generative models are well-suited to capture
complex patterns, they often lack the ability to model the non-uniform
conditions of diverse underwater environments. To address these challenges, we
employ K-means clustering to partition a dataset into style-specific domains.
We use separate encoders to get latent spaces for style and content; we further
integrate these latent representations via Adaptive Instance Normalization
(AdaIN) and decode the result to produce the final synthetic image. The model
is trained independently on each style cluster to preserve domain-specific
characteristics. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art performance,
obtaining a Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.9012, an average Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32.5118 dB, and a Frechet Inception Distance
(FID) of 13.3728.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型隐式3DMM模型imHead，用于建模和编辑3D头部形状，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DMM方法因严格拓扑和线性特性难以表示复杂头部形状，且局部编辑能力有限。

Method: 保留紧凑身份空间，引入区域特定潜在表示以实现局部编辑，并利用4K身份数据集训练。

Result: 模型在多样身份和表情表示上优于现有方法，并提供可解释的局部编辑功能。

Conclusion: imHead在3D头部建模和编辑方面表现出色，为3D面部操作提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Over the last years, 3D morphable models (3DMMs) have emerged as a
state-of-the-art methodology for modeling and generating expressive 3D avatars.
However, given their reliance on a strict topology, along with their linear
nature, they struggle to represent complex full-head shapes. Following the
advent of deep implicit functions, we propose imHead, a novel implicit 3DMM
that not only models expressive 3D head avatars but also facilitates localized
editing of the facial features. Previous methods directly divided the latent
space into local components accompanied by an identity encoding to capture the
global shape variations, leading to expensive latent sizes. In contrast, we
retain a single compact identity space and introduce an intermediate
region-specific latent representation to enable local edits. To train imHead,
we curate a large-scale dataset of 4K distinct identities, making a
step-towards large scale 3D head modeling. Under a series of experiments we
demonstrate the expressive power of the proposed model to represent diverse
identities and expressions outperforming previous approaches. Additionally, the
proposed approach provides an interpretable solution for 3D face manipulation,
allowing the user to make localized edits.

Result: 标注与CTC的金标准一致，且优于自动生成的银标准，能更好地反映图像复杂性。

Conclusion: 该数据集可用于细胞分割测试、训练及动态物体3D形状分析。

Abstract: High-quality, publicly available segmentation annotations of image and video
datasets are critical for advancing the field of image processing. In
particular, annotations of volumetric images of a large number of targets are
time-consuming and challenging. In (Melnikova, A., & Matula, P., 2025), we
presented the first publicly available full 3D time-lapse segmentation
annotations of migrating cells with complex dynamic shapes. Concretely, three
distinct humans annotated two sequences of MDA231 human breast carcinoma cells
(Fluo-C3DL-MDA231) from the Cell Tracking Challenge (CTC).
  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive description of the dataset and
accompanying experiments that were not included in (Melnikova, A., & Matula,
P., 2025) due to limitations in publication space. Namely, we show that the
created annotations are consistent with the previously published tracking
markers provided by the CTC organizers and the segmentation accuracy measured
based on the 2D gold truth of CTC is within the inter-annotator variability
margins. We compared the created 3D annotations with automatically created
silver truth provided by CTC. We have found the proposed annotations better
represent the complexity of the input images. The presented annotations can be
used for testing and training cell segmentation, or analyzing 3D shapes of
highly dynamic objects.

Abstract: Clouds remain a critical challenge in optical satellite imagery, hindering
reliable analysis for environmental monitoring, land cover mapping, and climate
research. To overcome this, we propose MSCloudCAM, a Cross-Attention with
Multi-Scale Context Network tailored for multispectral and multi-sensor cloud
segmentation. Our framework exploits the spectral richness of Sentinel-2
(CloudSEN12) and Landsat-8 (L8Biome) data to classify four semantic categories:
clear sky, thin cloud, thick cloud, and cloud shadow. MSCloudCAM combines a
Swin Transformer backbone for hierarchical feature extraction with multi-scale
context modules ASPP and PSP for enhanced scale-aware learning. A
Cross-Attention block enables effective multisensor and multispectral feature
fusion, while the integration of an Efficient Channel Attention Block (ECAB)
and a Spatial Attention Module adaptively refine feature representations.
Comprehensive experiments on CloudSEN12 and L8Biome demonstrate that MSCloudCAM
delivers state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy, surpassing leading baseline
architectures while maintaining competitive parameter efficiency and FLOPs.
These results underscore the model's effectiveness and practicality, making it
well-suited for large-scale Earth observation tasks and real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 结合XGBoost重训练和主动学习的方法为临床放射学中的公平深度学习部署提供了实用且有效的路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models have shown promise in improving diagnostic accuracy from
chest X-rays, but they also risk perpetuating healthcare disparities when
performance varies across demographic groups. In this work, we present a
comprehensive bias detection and mitigation framework targeting sex, age, and
race-based disparities when performing diagnostic tasks with chest X-rays. We
extend a recent CNN-XGBoost pipeline to support multi-label classification and
evaluate its performance across four medical conditions. We show that replacing
the final layer of CNN with an eXtreme Gradient Boosting classifier improves
the fairness of the subgroup while maintaining or improving the overall
predictive performance. To validate its generalizability, we apply the method
to different backbones, namely DenseNet-121 and ResNet-50, and achieve
similarly strong performance and fairness outcomes, confirming its
model-agnostic design. We further compare this lightweight adapter training
method with traditional full-model training bias mitigation techniques,
including adversarial training, reweighting, data augmentation, and active
learning, and find that our approach offers competitive or superior bias
reduction at a fraction of the computational cost. Finally, we show that
combining eXtreme Gradient Boosting retraining with active learning yields the
largest reduction in bias across all demographic subgroups, both in and out of
distribution on the CheXpert and MIMIC datasets, establishing a practical and
effective path toward equitable deep learning deployment in clinical radiology.

Result: 实验显示方法提速2.3倍且性能略优于基线。

Conclusion: 方法有效平衡了计算效率和性能。

Abstract: Recent transformer-based models for 3D Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) have
achieved strong performance but often suffer from high computational cost and
complexity due to deep transformer architectures and redundant tokens. In this
paper, we introduce two HMR-specific merging strategies: Error-Constrained
Layer Merging (ECLM) and Mask-guided Token Merging (Mask-ToMe). ECLM
selectively merges transformer layers that have minimal impact on the Mean Per
Joint Position Error (MPJPE), while Mask-ToMe focuses on merging background
tokens that contribute little to the final prediction. To further address the
potential performance drop caused by merging, we propose a diffusion-based
decoder that incorporates temporal context and leverages pose priors learned
from large-scale motion capture datasets. Experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves up to 2.3x speed-up while
slightly improving performance over the baseline.

Conclusion: RareBoost3D和CSC损失有效缓解长尾问题，提升跨域分割性能。

Abstract: Real-world point cloud datasets have made significant contributions to the
development of LiDAR-based perception technologies, such as object segmentation
for autonomous driving. However, due to the limited number of instances in some
rare classes, the long-tail problem remains a major challenge in existing
datasets. To address this issue, we introduce a novel, synthetic point cloud
dataset named RareBoost3D, which complements existing real-world datasets by
providing significantly more instances for object classes that are rare in
real-world datasets. To effectively leverage both synthetic and real-world
data, we further propose a cross-domain semantic alignment method named CSC
loss that aligns feature representations of the same class across different
domains. Experimental results demonstrate that this alignment significantly
enhances the performance of LiDAR point cloud segmentation models over
real-world data.

Motivation: 当前VLMs在图像地理定位任务中的能力尚未全面评估，而这一任务在现实生活中有重要需求。

Method: EarthWhere包含两个地理定位尺度：WhereCountry（国家级别）和WhereStreet（街道级别），采用多种评估指标，包括位置准确性和推理链评分。

Result: Gemini-2.5-Pro表现最佳（56.32%准确率），但模型存在区域偏见，且网络搜索和推理在视觉线索有限时效果不佳。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs在地理定位任务中的潜力和挑战，尤其是偏见和细粒度定位的鲁棒性问题。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have advanced rapidly, yet their capacity for
image-grounded geolocation in open-world conditions, a task that is challenging
and of demand in real life, has not been comprehensively evaluated. We present
EarthWhere, a comprehensive benchmark for VLM image geolocation that evaluates
visual recognition, step-by-step reasoning, and evidence use. EarthWhere
comprises 810 globally distributed images across two complementary geolocation
scales: WhereCountry (i.e., 500 multiple-choice question-answering, with
country-level answer and panoramas) and WhereStreet (i.e., 310 fine-grained
street-level identification tasks requiring multi-step reasoning with optional
web search). For evaluation, we adopt the final-prediction metrics: location
accuracies within k km (Acc@k) for coordinates and hierarchical path scores for
textual localization. Beyond this, we propose to explicitly score intermediate
reasoning chains using human-verified key visual clues and a Shapley-reweighted
thinking score that attributes credit to each clue's marginal contribution. We
benchmark 13 state-of-the-art VLMs with web searching tools on our EarthWhere
and report different types of final answer accuracies as well as the calibrated
model thinking scores. Overall, Gemini-2.5-Pro achieves the best average
accuracy at 56.32%, while the strongest open-weight model, GLM-4.5V, reaches
34.71%. We reveal that web search and reasoning do not guarantee improved
performance when visual clues are limited, and models exhibit regional biases,
achieving up to 42.7% higher scores in certain areas than others. These
findings highlight not only the promise but also the persistent challenges of
models to mitigate bias and achieve robust, fine-grained localization. We
open-source our benchmark at https://github.com/UCSC-VLAA/EarthWhere.

Method: 提出ToMCLIP框架，利用持久同调定义拓扑对齐损失，并通过图稀疏化策略近似持久图。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了多语言表示的结构一致性，在CIFAR-100上零样本准确率更高，在xFlickr&CO上多语言检索性能更强。

Conclusion: ToMCLIP为表示学习提供了一种通用的拓扑对齐方法，适用于视觉语言模型及其他领域。

Abstract: Contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong zero-shot
capabilities. However, their cross-modal alignment remains biased toward
English due to limited multilingual multimodal data. Recent multilingual
extensions have alleviated this gap but enforce instance-level alignment while
neglecting the global geometry of the shared embedding space. We address this
problem by introducing ToMCLIP (Topological Alignment for Multilingual CLIP), a
topology-aware framework aligning embedding spaces with topology-preserving
constraints. The proposed method applies persistent homology to define a
topological alignment loss and approximates persistence diagram with
theoretical error bounds using graph sparsification strategy. This work
validates the proposed approach, showing enhanced structural coherence of
multilingual representations, higher zero-shot accuracy on the CIFAR-100, and
stronger multilingual retrieval performance on the xFlickr&CO. Beyond VLMs, the
proposed approach provides a general method for incorporating topological
alignment into representation learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneTextStylizer是一个无需训练的扩散模型框架，用于场景图像中文本的灵活高保真风格迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景文本编辑方法局限于内容替换和简单风格，缺乏自由风格迁移能力。

Method: 设计了特征注入模块和区域控制机制，结合傅里叶变换增强风格丰富性。

Result: 在视觉保真度和文本保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了场景文本的高质量风格转换。

Abstract: With the rapid development of diffusion models, style transfer has made
remarkable progress. However, flexible and localized style editing for scene
text remains an unsolved challenge. Although existing scene text editing
methods have achieved text region editing, they are typically limited to
content replacement and simple styles, which lack the ability of free-style
transfer. In this paper, we introduce SceneTextStylizer, a novel training-free
diffusion-based framework for flexible and high-fidelity style transfer of text
in scene images. Unlike prior approaches that either perform global style
transfer or focus solely on textual content modification, our method enables
prompt-guided style transformation specifically for text regions, while
preserving both text readability and stylistic consistency. To achieve this, we
design a feature injection module that leverages diffusion model inversion and
self-attention to transfer style features effectively. Additionally, a region
control mechanism is introduced by applying a distance-based changing mask at
each denoising step, enabling precise spatial control. To further enhance
visual quality, we incorporate a style enhancement module based on the Fourier
transform to reinforce stylistic richness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in scene text style
transformation, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in both visual
fidelity and text preservation.

challenges, we introduce DreamMakup - a novel training-free Diffusion model
based Makeup Customization method, leveraging the inherent advantages of
diffusion models for superior controllability and precise real-image editing.
DreamMakeup employs early-stopped DDIM inversion to preserve the facial
structure and identity while enabling extensive customization through various
conditioning inputs such as reference images, specific RGB colors, and textual
descriptions. Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing
GAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization,
color-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with
textual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在非英语环境下的细粒度视觉语言对齐能力有限，尤其是对对象属性、空间关系和双语理解的支持不足。

Method: 采用区域-文本匹配、长标题建模和多判别目标，并引入TIC损失以区分语义相似的标题。

Result: 在29个数据集和8个任务上表现优异，中英文均达到SOTA。

Conclusion: FG-CLIP 2通过双语细粒度对齐推动了多模态理解研究，并发布了模型、代码和基准。

Abstract: Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between
visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited
in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP
perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained
details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions,
with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges,
we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance
fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages
rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption
modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce
the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish
semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of
large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual
performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for
Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding
box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show
that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results
in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate
future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.

*Namhoon Kim,Sara Fridovich-Keil*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需校准的实例级不确定性指标，用于检测生成模型在逆问题中的分布偏移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型在逆问题中作为数据驱动先验表现良好，但可能因测试数据超出训练分布而生成虚假特征，现有方法需校准数据集或提供启发式估计。

Method: 利用随机测量变化下重建图像的稳定性作为分布偏移的代理指标，无需训练分布知识或额外训练成本。

Result: 在MNIST数字的断层重建中，OOD数字的重建表现出更高变异性和误差，验证了指标有效性。

Conclusion: 建议将生成先验与轻量级保护机制结合，在分布内时减少测量，分布外时自动警告。

Abstract: Generative models have shown strong potential as data-driven priors for
solving inverse problems such as reconstructing medical images from
undersampled measurements. While these priors improve reconstruction quality
with fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie
outside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods
in this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may
not be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or
(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather
than distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free
uncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no
knowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key
hypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable
under random measurement variations, while reconstructions of
out-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this
stability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift. Our proposed OOD
indicator is efficiently computable for any computational imaging inverse
problem; we demonstrate it on tomographic reconstruction of MNIST digits, where
a learned proximal network trained only on digit "0" is evaluated on all ten
digits. Reconstructions of OOD digits show higher variability and
correspondingly higher reconstruction error, validating this indicator. These
results suggest a deployment strategy that pairs generative priors with
lightweight guardrails, enabling aggressive measurement reduction for
in-distribution cases while automatically warning when priors are applied out
of distribution.

TL;DR: IUT-Plug模块通过图像理解树（IUT）增强现有视觉语言模型，解决逻辑、对象身份和风格在多模态图像-文本生成中的上下文漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如GPT-4和DALL-E）在多模态图像-文本生成中难以保持逻辑、对象身份和风格的一致性，限制了其泛化能力。

Method: 提出IUT-Plug模块，分两阶段工作：动态IUT-Plug提取模块解析视觉场景为层次符号结构；协调叙事流和图像合成机制确保跨模态一致性。

Result: 实验表明，IUT-Plug在多样化多模态问答场景中不仅提高了准确性，还缓解了三种关键形式的上下文漂移。

Conclusion: IUT-Plug通过结构化推理显著提升了视觉语言模型在多模态任务中的性能。

Abstract: Existing vision language models (VLMs), including GPT-4 and DALL-E, often
struggle to preserve logic, object identity, and style in multimodal image-text
generation. This limitation significantly hinders the generalization capability
of VLMs in complex image-text input-output scenarios. To address this issue, we
propose IUT-Plug, a module grounded in an Image Understanding Tree (IUT), which
enhances existing interleaved VLMs through explicit structured reasoning,
thereby mitigating context drift in logic, entity identity, and style. The
proposed framework operates in two stages. (1) A dynamic IUT-Plug extraction
module parses visual scenes into hierarchical symbolic structures. (2) A
coordinated narrative-flow and image synthesis mechanism ensures cross-modal
consistency. To evaluate our approach, we construct a novel benchmark based on
3,000 real human-generated question-answer pairs over fine-tuned large models,
introducing a dynamic evaluation protocol for quantifying context drift in
interleaved VLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that IUT-Plug not only
improves accuracy on established benchmarks but also effectively alleviates the
three critical forms of context drift across diverse multimodal question
answering (QA) scenarios.

TL;DR: Chart-RVR框架通过GRPO和可验证奖励提升LVLMs在图表推理中的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LVLMs在OOD数据和生成CoT时表现不佳，限制了可解释性。

Method: 结合GRPO与三种自动验证奖励（图表分类、表格重建、流程一致性）微调LVLMs。

Result: 在6个基准测试中超越同类模型，缩小OOD性能差距并提升推理忠实度。

Conclusion: Chart-RVR展示了可验证奖励与GRPO在训练可靠、可解释图表推理模型中的潜力。

Abstract: The capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have reached
state-of-the-art on many visual reasoning tasks, including chart reasoning, yet
they still falter on out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and degrade further when
asked to produce their chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, limiting
explainability. We present Chart-RVR, a general framework that fine-tunes LVLMs
to be more robust and explainable for chart reasoning by coupling Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with automatically verifiable rewards. Our
framework comprises of three rewards that maximize: (i) correct chart-type
classification, (ii) faithful chart table reconstruction, and (iii) process
conformity. Applied to 3-billion-parameter LVLMs, Chart-RVR consistently
outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on both in-distribution and
out-of-distribution datasets, closing the OOD performance gap while improving
rationale fidelity. The resulting models, the Chart-RVR-3B series, achieve
state-of-the-art results on six chart-reasoning benchmarks spanning in-domain
and OOD settings, surpassing all existing models of comparable size. Beyond
accuracy, Chart-RVR yields more interpretable CoT rationales, strengthening
trust and reliability - showcasing the power of verifiable rewards with GRPO
for training reliable, interpretable chart-reasoning models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态视频理解任务中，强模态容易主导学习，抑制弱模态的贡献，导致模型过拟合。

Method: MM在多模态特征层面应用Mixup策略生成虚拟特征-标签对；B-MM在此基础上动态调整各模态的混合比例。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，方法能有效提升模型的泛化能力和多模态鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MM和B-MM通过平衡模态贡献，显著改善了多模态模型的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal video understanding plays a crucial role in tasks such as action
recognition and emotion classification by combining information from different
modalities. However, multimodal models are prone to overfitting strong
modalities, which can dominate learning and suppress the contributions of
weaker ones. To address this challenge, we first propose Multimodal Mixup (MM),
which applies the Mixup strategy at the aggregated multimodal feature level to
mitigate overfitting by generating virtual feature-label pairs. While MM
effectively improves generalization, it treats all modalities uniformly and
does not account for modality imbalance during training. Building on MM, we
further introduce Balanced Multimodal Mixup (B-MM), which dynamically adjusts
the mixing ratios for each modality based on their relative contributions to
the learning objective. Extensive experiments on several datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of our methods in improving generalization and multimodal
robustness.

Conclusion: 总结了Agentic MLLMs的应用，并展望了未来研究方向。

Abstract: With the recent emergence of revolutionary autonomous agentic systems,
research community is witnessing a significant shift from traditional static,
passive, and domain-specific AI agents toward more dynamic, proactive, and
generalizable agentic AI. Motivated by the growing interest in agentic AI and
its potential trajectory toward AGI, we present a comprehensive survey on
Agentic Multimodal Large Language Models (Agentic MLLMs). In this survey, we
explore the emerging paradigm of agentic MLLMs, delineating their conceptual
foundations and distinguishing characteristics from conventional MLLM-based
agents. We establish a conceptual framework that organizes agentic MLLMs along
three fundamental dimensions: (i) Agentic internal intelligence functions as
the system's commander, enabling accurate long-horizon planning through
reasoning, reflection, and memory; (ii) Agentic external tool invocation,
whereby models proactively use various external tools to extend their
problem-solving capabilities beyond their intrinsic knowledge; and (iii)
Agentic environment interaction further situates models within virtual or
physical environments, allowing them to take actions, adapt strategies, and
sustain goal-directed behavior in dynamic real-world scenarios. To further
accelerate research in this area for the community, we compile open-source
training frameworks, training and evaluation datasets for developing agentic
MLLMs. Finally, we review the downstream applications of agentic MLLMs and
outline future research directions for this rapidly evolving field. To
continuously track developments in this rapidly evolving field, we will also
actively update a public repository at

Abstract: 3D Gaussian inpainting, a critical technique for numerous applications in
virtual reality and multimedia, has made significant progress with pretrained
diffusion models. However, ensuring multi-view consistency, an essential
requirement for high-quality inpainting, remains a key challenge. In this work,
we present PAInpainter, a novel approach designed to advance 3D Gaussian
inpainting by leveraging perspective-aware content propagation and consistency
verification across multi-view inpainted images. Our method iteratively refines
inpainting and optimizes the 3D Gaussian representation with multiple views
adaptively sampled from a perspective graph. By propagating inpainted images as
prior information and verifying consistency across neighboring views,
PAInpainter substantially enhances global consistency and texture fidelity in
restored 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
PAInpainter over existing methods. Our approach achieves superior 3D inpainting
quality, with PSNR scores of 26.03 dB and 29.51 dB on the SPIn-NeRF and
NeRFiller datasets, respectively, highlighting its effectiveness and

Motivation: 现代扩散模型在多实例图像生成中难以实现精确的布局控制和多主体身份一致性，ContextGen旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出ContextGen框架，包含Contextual Layout Anchoring（CLA）机制和Identity Consistency Attention（ICA）机制，并引入IMIG-100K数据集。

Result: 实验表明，ContextGen在控制精度、身份一致性和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ContextGen为多实例图像生成提供了新的解决方案，并在性能上达到新高度。

Abstract: Multi-instance image generation (MIG) remains a significant challenge for
modern diffusion models due to key limitations in achieving precise control
over object layout and preserving the identity of multiple distinct subjects.
To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion
Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both
layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical
contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates
the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the
objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA),
an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to
ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. Recognizing the lack of
large-scale, hierarchically-structured datasets for this task, we introduce
IMIG-100K, the first dataset with detailed layout and identity annotations.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art,
outperforming existing methods in control precision, identity fidelity, and
overall visual quality.

Motivation: 解决基础模型在复杂低对比度背景下难以区分肿瘤与正常组织的问题。

Result: 在多数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂条件下的鲁棒性和细节识别。

Conclusion: FASS显著提升低对比度图像分割效果，适用于更复杂的医学场景。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of tumors and adjacent normal tissues in medical images
is essential for surgical planning and tumor staging. Although foundation
models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to
focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some
malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual
differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware
Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware
module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume
space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas.
Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform,
extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition
and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to
preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments
on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all
metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in
robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our
framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving
the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，需要改进其理解多对象、属性和关系的能力。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，COCO-Tree将组合泛化性能提升了5-10%。

Conclusion: COCO-Tree有效提升了VLMs的组合推理能力，并提供了可解释的推理过程。

Abstract: Compositional reasoning remains a persistent weakness of modern vision
language models (VLMs): they often falter when a task hinges on understanding
how multiple objects, attributes, and relations interact within an image.
Multiple research works have attempted to improve compositionality performance
by creative tricks such as improving prompt structure, chain of thought
reasoning, etc. A more recent line of work attempts to impart additional
reasoning in VLMs using well-trained Large Language Models (LLMs), which are
far superior in linguistic understanding than VLMs to compensate for the
limited linguistic prowess of VLMs. However, these approaches are either
resource-intensive or do not provide an interpretable reasoning process. In
this paper, we present 'COCO-Tree' - a novel approach that augments VLM outputs
with carefully designed neurosymbolic concept trees learned from LLMs to
improve VLM's linguistic reasoning. COCO-Tree's beam search-inspired reasoning
process boosts compositionality performance and provides a rationale behind VLM
predictions. Empirical results on four compositionality benchmarks, Winoground,
EqBench, ColorSwap, and SugarCrepe, in seven different open-source VLMs with
varying sizes, demonstrate that COCO-Tree significantly improves compositional
generalization by 5-10% over baselines.

Motivation: 现有方法难以平衡全局和局部动态建模，且全局依赖的二次复杂度限制了高分辨率序列的应用。

Method: 提出Global Spatiotemporal Mamba和Local Refinement Mamba，分别高效提取全局表示和增强局部细节。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于现有VHPE方法，同时实现更好的计算权衡。

Conclusion: 扩展Mamba框架成功解决了全局与局部建模的平衡问题，提升了VHPE性能。

Abstract: Modeling high-resolution spatiotemporal representations, including both
global dynamic contexts (e.g., holistic human motion tendencies) and local
motion details (e.g., high-frequency changes of keypoints), is essential for
video-based human pose estimation (VHPE). Current state-of-the-art methods
typically unify spatiotemporal learning within a single type of modeling
structure (convolution or attention-based blocks), which inherently have
difficulties in balancing global and local dynamic modeling and may bias the
network to one of them, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, existing
VHPE models suffer from quadratic complexity when capturing global
dependencies, limiting their applicability especially for high-resolution
sequences. Recently, the state space models (known as Mamba) have demonstrated
significant potential in modeling long-range contexts with linear complexity;
however, they are restricted to 1D sequential data. In this paper, we present a
novel framework that extends Mamba from two aspects to separately learn global
and local high-resolution spatiotemporal representations for VHPE.
Specifically, we first propose a Global Spatiotemporal Mamba, which performs 6D
selective space-time scan and spatial- and temporal-modulated scan merging to
efficiently extract global representations from high-resolution sequences. We
further introduce a windowed space-time scan-based Local Refinement Mamba to
enhance the high-frequency details of localized keypoint motions. Extensive
experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed model
outperforms state-of-the-art VHPE approaches while achieving better
computational trade-offs.

Result: GeoVLMath在3B和7B规模上表现优异，优于其他开源和专有模型。

Conclusion: 通过文本描述和强化学习，显著提升了模型在几何问题中的辅助线推理能力。

Abstract: Auxiliary lines are essential for solving complex geometric problems but
remain challenging for large vision-language models (LVLMs). Rather than
editing diagrams to draw auxiliary lines, which current image editing models
struggle to render with geometric precision, we generate textual descriptions
of auxiliary-line constructions to better align with the representational
strengths of LVLMs. To bridge the gap between textual descriptions and spatial
structure, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that enhances
diagram-text alignment. At the core of our approach is a cross-modal reward
that evaluates how well the generated auxiliary-line description for an
original diagram matches a ground-truth auxiliary-line diagram. Built on this
reward, we present GeoVLMath, an open-source LVLM tailored to auxiliary-line
reasoning in solid geometry. This fine-grained signal drives a GRPO-based RL
stage, yielding precise diagram-text alignment. To support training, we develop
a scalable data creation pipeline and construct AuxSolidMath, a dataset of
3,018 real-exam geometry problems with paired diagrams and aligned textual
fields. At the 3B and 7B scales, GeoVLMath achieves competitive and often
superior performance compared with strong open-source and proprietary LVLMs on

Conclusion: GIR-Bench为多模态模型的系统评估提供了新工具，揭示了当前模型的局限性，并推动了未来研究。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models integrate the reasoning capacity of large language
models with both image understanding and generation, showing great promise for
advanced multimodal intelligence. However, the community still lacks a rigorous
reasoning-centric benchmark to systematically evaluate the alignment between
understanding and generation, and their generalization potential in complex
visual tasks. To this end, we introduce \textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive
benchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary
perspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency
(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same
knowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate
whether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that
requires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate
faithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I). Thirdly, we evaluate whether models
can handle multi-step reasoning in editing (GIR-Bench-Edit). For each subset,
we carefully design different task-specific evaluation pipelines tailored for
each task. This enables fine-grained and interpretable evaluation while
mitigating biases from the prevalent MLLM-as-a-Judge paradigm. Extensive
ablations over various unified models and generation-only systems have shown
that: Although unified models are more capable of reasoning-driven visual
tasks, they still exhibit a persistent gap between understanding and
generation. The data and code for GIR-Bench are available at

Abstract: While significant research has focused on developing embodied reasoning
capabilities using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) or integrating advanced VLMs
into Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for end-to-end robot control, few
studies directly address the critical gap between upstream VLM-based reasoning
and downstream VLA policy learning. In this work, we take an initial step
toward bridging embodied reasoning with VLA policy learning by introducing
Vlaser - a Vision-Language-Action Model with synergistic embodied reasoning
capability, which is a foundational vision-language model designed to integrate
high-level reasoning with low-level control for embodied agents. Built upon the
high-quality Vlaser-6M dataset, Vlaser achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of embodied reasoning benchmarks - including spatial reasoning,
embodied grounding, embodied QA, and task planning. Furthermore, we
systematically examine how different VLM initializations affect supervised VLA
fine-tuning, offering novel insights into mitigating the domain shift between
internet-scale pre-training data and embodied-specific policy learning data.
Based on these insights, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the
WidowX benchmark and competitive performance on the Google Robot benchmark.

Motivation: 基础模型在零样本异常分割任务中表现出强大的泛化能力，但如何正确引导这些模型解决下游任务仍是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了两阶段框架：1) Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG)模块，利用CLIP和SAM生成正负点提示；2) Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS)模块，通过混合提示和轻量级解码器优化分割结果。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了方法的有效性，特别是在Visa数据集上，F1-max和AP指标分别比现有方法提升了10.3%和7.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本异常分割任务中达到了最先进的性能，展示了CLIP和SAM协同工作的潜力。

Abstract: Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models
has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks.
However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks
remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for
zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This
framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of
CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's
inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt
Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to
generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on
segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further
optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated
noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module
employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving
precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent
experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly
noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the
state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP
metrics, respectively.

Motivation: 喉癌影像研究缺乏标准化数据集，限制了可重复的深度学习模型开发。

Method: 通过弱监督参数搜索框架提取1毫米等距兴趣区域，并评估了多种3D深度学习架构的性能。

Result: 3D CNN和ResNet18分别在早期与晚期喉癌分类和T4与非T4分类任务中表现最佳。

Conclusion: LaryngealCT为喉癌AI研究提供了可重复的基础，支持临床决策。

Abstract: Laryngeal cancer imaging research lacks standardised datasets to enable
reproducible deep learning (DL) model development. We present LaryngealCT, a
curated benchmark of 1,029 computed tomography (CT) scans aggregated from six
collections from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Uniform 1 mm isotropic
volumes of interest encompassing the larynx were extracted using a weakly
supervised parameter search framework validated by clinical experts. 3D DL
architectures (3D CNN, ResNet18,50,101, DenseNet121) were benchmarked on (i)
early (Tis,T1,T2) vs. advanced (T3,T4) and (ii) T4 vs. non-T4 classification
tasks. 3D CNN (AUC-0.881, F1-macro-0.821) and ResNet18 (AUC-0.892,
F1-macro-0.646) respectively outperformed the other models in the two tasks.
Model explainability assessed using 3D GradCAMs with thyroid cartilage overlays
revealed greater peri-cartilage attention in non-T4 cases and focal activations
in T4 predictions. Through open-source data, pretrained models, and integrated
explainability tools, LaryngealCT offers a reproducible foundation for
AI-driven research to support clinical decisions in laryngeal oncology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本引导扩散模型在真实人脸编辑任务中难以保持ID和结构一致性。

Method: 将人脸表示分解为ID和属性特征，作为联合条件指导反转和反向扩散过程。

Result: 支持仅使用文本提示的复杂多属性人脸编辑任务，无需区域特定输入，且速度与DDIM反转相当。

Conclusion: 实验证明了该方法的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-guided diffusion models have shown promise for
general image editing via inversion techniques, but often struggle to maintain
ID and structural consistency in real face editing tasks. To address this
limitation, we propose a zero-shot face editing method based on ID-Attribute
Decoupled Inversion. Specifically, we decompose the face representation into ID
and attribute features, using them as joint conditions to guide both the
inversion and the reverse diffusion processes. This allows independent control
over ID and attributes, ensuring strong ID preservation and structural
consistency while enabling precise facial attribute manipulation. Our method
supports a wide range of complex multi-attribute face editing tasks using only
text prompts, without requiring region-specific input, and operates at a speed
comparable to DDIM inversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate its
practicality and effectiveness.

Conclusion: 为未来语言感知的视频分割技术发展指明了方向。

Abstract: This report presents an overview of the 7th Large-scale Video Object
Segmentation (LSVOS) Challenge held in conjunction with ICCV 2025. Besides the
two traditional tracks of LSVOS that jointly target robustness in realistic
video scenarios: Classic VOS (VOS), and Referring VOS (RVOS), the 2025 edition
features a newly introduced track, Complex VOS (MOSEv2). Building upon prior
insights, MOSEv2 substantially increases difficulty, introducing more
challenging but realistic scenarios including denser small objects, frequent
disappear/reappear events, severe occlusions, adverse weather and lighting,
etc., pushing long-term consistency and generalization beyond curated
benchmarks. The challenge retains standard ${J}$, $F$, and ${J\&F}$ metrics for
VOS and RVOS, while MOSEv2 adopts ${J\&\dot{F}}$ as the primary ranking metric
to better evaluate objects across scales and disappearance cases. We summarize
datasets and protocols, highlight top-performing solutions, and distill
emerging trends, such as the growing role of LLM/MLLM components and
memory-aware propagation, aiming to chart future directions for resilient,
language-aware video segmentation in the wild.

Motivation: 解决现有SFOD方法对DETR架构适配不足的问题，提升目标域检测的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 包含四个模块：OSSR（基于目标性得分的样本重加权）、CMMB（对比学习与记忆库）、UQFD（不确定性加权的查询特征蒸馏）和DTUI（动态教师更新间隔的自训练）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，验证了其对DETR模型的适配性和有效性。

Conclusion: FRANCK为DETR-based SFOD提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了目标域检测性能。

Abstract: Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) enables knowledge transfer from a source
domain to an unsupervised target domain for object detection without access to
source data. Most existing SFOD approaches are either confined to conventional
object detection (OD) models like Faster R-CNN or designed as general solutions
without tailored adaptations for novel OD architectures, especially Detection
Transformer (DETR). In this paper, we introduce Feature Reweighting ANd
Contrastive Learning NetworK (FRANCK), a novel SFOD framework specifically
designed to perform query-centric feature enhancement for DETRs. FRANCK
comprises four key components: (1) an Objectness Score-based Sample Reweighting
(OSSR) module that computes attention-based objectness scores on multi-scale
encoder feature maps, reweighting the detection loss to emphasize
less-recognized regions; (2) a Contrastive Learning with Matching-based Memory
Bank (CMMB) module that integrates multi-level features into memory banks,
enhancing class-wise contrastive learning; (3) an Uncertainty-weighted
Query-fused Feature Distillation (UQFD) module that improves feature
distillation through prediction quality reweighting and query feature fusion;
and (4) an improved self-training pipeline with a Dynamic Teacher Updating
Interval (DTUI) that optimizes pseudo-label quality. By leveraging these
components, FRANCK effectively adapts a source-pre-trained DETR model to a
target domain with enhanced robustness and generalization. Extensive
experiments on several widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its effectiveness and
compatibility with DETR-based SFOD models.

Result: 在真实数据集上优于现有方法，对复杂CAD图纸表现出更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了文本注释和原语关系建模问题，提升了符号识别性能。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of Computer-Aided Design(CAD) drawings in
engineering, architecture, and industrial design, the ability to accurately
interpret and analyze these drawings has become increasingly critical. Among
various subtasks, panoptic symbol spotting plays a vital role in enabling
downstream applications such as CAD automation and design retrieval. Existing
methods primarily focus on geometric primitives within the CAD drawings to
address this task, but they face following major problems: they usually
overlook the rich textual annotations present in CAD drawings and they lack
explicit modeling of relationships among primitives, resulting in
incomprehensive understanding of the holistic drawings. To fill this gap, we
propose a panoptic symbol spotting framework that incorporates textual
annotations. The framework constructs unified representations by jointly
modeling geometric and textual primitives. Then, using visual features extract
by pretrained CNN as the initial representations, a Transformer-based backbone
is employed, enhanced with a type-aware attention mechanism to explicitly model
the different types of spatial dependencies between various primitives.
Extensive experiments on the real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms existing approaches on symbol spotting tasks involving
textual annotations, and exhibits superior robustness when applied to complex
CAD drawings.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖当前场景上下文，低估了场景动态和时序演化的影响，限制了复杂驾驶场景中的决策能力。

Method: SeerDrive通过预测未来鸟瞰图（BEV）表示来预判场景动态，并利用此信息生成未来感知的轨迹，结合未来感知规划和迭代优化。

Result: 在NAVSIM和nuScenes基准测试中，SeerDrive显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SeerDrive通过闭环建模场景动态和轨迹规划，提升了自动驾驶的适应性和决策能力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving methods aim to directly map raw sensor inputs
to future driving actions such as planned trajectories, bypassing traditional
modular pipelines. While these approaches have shown promise, they often
operate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene
context, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their
temporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make
informed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new
perspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely
intertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the
vehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.
Motivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel
end-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory
planning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye
view (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,
then leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.
Two key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects
predicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene
modeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and
trajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments
on the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 在图像描述和视觉问答任务中显著提升鲁棒性，且对未知攻击具有强迁移性。

Conclusion: 监督扩散去噪为多模态防御提供了有效途径，增强了MLLM在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal
reasoning by integrating visual and textual modalities. However, their
multimodal nature also exposes them to adversarial threats, where attackers can
perturb either modality or both jointly to induce harmful, misleading, or
policy violating outputs. Existing defense strategies, such as adversarial
training and input purification, face notable limitations: adversarial training
typically improves robustness only against known attacks while incurring high
computational costs, whereas conventional purification approaches often suffer
from degraded image quality and insufficient generalization to complex
multimodal tasks.
  In this work, we focus on defending the visual modality, which frequently
serves as the primary entry point for adversarial manipulation. We propose a
supervised diffusion based denoising framework that leverages paired
adversarial clean image datasets to fine-tune diffusion models with
directional, task specific guidance. Unlike prior unsupervised purification
methods such as DiffPure, our approach achieves higher quality reconstructions
while significantly improving defense robustness in multimodal tasks.
Furthermore, we incorporate prompt optimization as a complementary defense
mechanism, enhancing resistance against diverse and unseen attack strategies.
  Extensive experiments on image captioning and visual question answering
demonstrate that our method not only substantially improves robustness but also
exhibits strong transferability to unknown adversarial attacks. These results
highlight the effectiveness of supervised diffusion based denoising for
multimodal defense, paving the way for more reliable and secure deployment of
MLLMs in real world applications.

Conclusion: 总结了当前挑战并展望了未来研究方向，旨在推动CZSL领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) is a critical task in computer vision
that enables models to recognize unseen combinations of known attributes and
objects during inference, addressing the combinatorial challenge of requiring
training data for every possible composition. This is particularly challenging
because the visual appearance of primitives is highly contextual; for example,
``small'' cats appear visually distinct from ``older'' ones, and ``wet'' cars
differ significantly from ``wet'' cats. Effectively modeling this contextuality
and the inherent compositionality is crucial for robust compositional zero-shot
recognition. This paper presents, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive
survey specifically focused on Compositional Zero-Shot Learning. We
systematically review the state-of-the-art CZSL methods, introducing a taxonomy
grounded in disentanglement, with four families of approaches: no explicit
disentanglement, textual disentanglement, visual disentanglement, and
cross-modal disentanglement. We provide a detailed comparative analysis of
these methods, highlighting their core advantages and limitations in different
problem settings, such as closed-world and open-world CZSL. Finally, we
identify the most significant open challenges and outline promising future
research directions. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource to
guide and inspire further advancements in this fascinating and important field.

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够生成合理且语义一致的3D场景运动。

Conclusion: MoMap不仅支持3D运动生成，还为2D视频合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of learning semantically and functionally
meaningful 3D motion priors from real-world videos, in order to enable
prediction of future 3D scene motion from a single input image. We propose a
novel pixel-aligned Motion Map (MoMap) representation for 3D scene motion,
which can be generated from existing generative image models to facilitate
efficient and effective motion prediction. To learn meaningful distributions
over motion, we create a large-scale database of MoMaps from over 50,000 real
videos and train a diffusion model on these representations. Our motion
generation not only synthesizes trajectories in 3D but also suggests a new
pipeline for 2D video synthesis: first generate a MoMap, then warp an image
accordingly and complete the warped point-based renderings. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach generates plausible and semantically
consistent 3D scene motion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用纵向多模态数据（如EHR和CXR）建模疾病进展时，存在CXR序列冗余和EHR数据时间不对齐的挑战。

Method: 通过区域感知解耦分离静态和动态特征，并采用多时间尺度对齐方法同步CXR和EHR数据。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上，DiPro有效提取了临床动态特征，并在疾病进展识别和ICU预测任务中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DiPro框架为多模态数据建模疾病进展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and
sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression,
yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in
consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over
clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse,
irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\texttt{DiPro}$, a
novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware
disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static
(anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs,
prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these
static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise
interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent
progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate
that $\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and
achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification
and general ICU prediction tasks.

TL;DR: SynTrans框架通过多模态知识转移提升小样本学习性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>

Motivation: 小样本学习中数据稀缺问题，现有方法因数据简单引入噪声和偏见。

Method: 利用CLIP作为教师模型，通过无监督代理任务和协同知识挖掘模块实现知识转移。

Conclusion: SynTrans框架有效解决了小样本学习中的知识转移问题。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses the challenge of classifying novel classes
with limited training samples. While some methods leverage semantic knowledge
from smaller-scale models to mitigate data scarcity, these approaches often
introduce noise and bias due to the data's inherent simplicity. In this paper,
we propose a novel framework, Synergistic Knowledge Transfer (SynTrans), which
effectively transfers diverse and complementary knowledge from large multimodal
models to empower the off-the-shelf few-shot learner. Specifically, SynTrans
employs CLIP as a robust teacher and uses a few-shot vision encoder as a weak
student, distilling semantic-aligned visual knowledge via an unsupervised proxy
task. Subsequently, a training-free synergistic knowledge mining module
facilitates collaboration among large multimodal models to extract high-quality
semantic knowledge. Building upon this, a visual-semantic bridging module
enables bi-directional knowledge transfer between visual and semantic spaces,
transforming explicit visual and implicit semantic knowledge into
category-specific classifier weights. Finally, SynTrans introduces a visual
weight generator and a semantic weight reconstructor to adaptively construct
optimal multimodal FSL classifiers. Experimental results on four FSL datasets
demonstrate that SynTrans, even when paired with a simple few-shot vision
encoder, significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了扩散模型是否能通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定的对象数量，发现仅靠扩大规模无效，并提出了一种通过注入计数感知布局信息的方法显著提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究扩散模型是否能够通过扩大数据集和模型规模来准确生成文本提示中指定的对象数量，以解决当前文本到图像生成模型在计数任务上的不足。

Method: 构建了两个合成数据集（GrayCount250和NaturalCount6）进行实验，发现扩散模型依赖噪声初始化而非文本提示中的计数信息，并提出了一种通过注入计数感知布局信息的方法。

Result: 实验表明，仅扩大模型和数据集规模无法提高计数准确性，而提出的方法在GrayCount250上将准确率从20.0%提升到85.3%，在NaturalCount6上从74.8%提升到86.3%。

Conclusion: 扩散模型在计数任务上依赖噪声初始化，仅靠扩大规模无效，但通过注入计数感知布局信息可以显著提高准确性。

Abstract: Numerosity remains a challenge for state-of-the-art text-to-image generation
models like FLUX and GPT-4o, which often fail to accurately follow counting
instructions in text prompts. In this paper, we aim to study a fundamental yet
often overlooked question: Can diffusion models inherently generate the correct
number of objects specified by a textual prompt simply by scaling up the
dataset and model size? To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we
construct a clean synthetic numerosity benchmark comprising two complementary
datasets: GrayCount250 for controlled scaling studies, and NaturalCount6
featuring complex naturalistic scenes. Second, we empirically show that the
scaling hypothesis does not hold: larger models and datasets alone fail to
improve counting accuracy on our benchmark. Our analysis identifies a key
reason: diffusion models tend to rely heavily on the noise initialization
rather than the explicit numerosity specified in the prompt. We observe that
noise priors exhibit biases toward specific object counts. In addition, we
propose an effective strategy for controlling numerosity by injecting
count-aware layout information into the noise prior. Our method achieves
significant gains, improving accuracy on GrayCount250 from 20.0\% to 85.3\% and
on NaturalCount6 from 74.8\% to 86.3\%, demonstrating effective generalization
across settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: video-SALMONN S是一种流式音频-视觉LLM，首次能在固定内存预算下处理3小时视频（1 FPS，360p分辨率），通过测试时训练内存模块和选择性记忆读取实现高效长视频理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解LLM难以扩展，离线方法需调整帧率，流式方法因合并或丢弃令牌而丢失信息。

Method: 引入测试时训练（TTT）内存模块和提示依赖的记忆读取器，采用Hessian-free共轭梯度优化。

Result: 在长视频基准测试中表现优异，8B参数模型在Video-MME长片段上达到74.2%和67.8%的准确率。

Conclusion: video-SALMONN S在固定内存下高效处理长视频，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Continuous, high-frame-rate, high-resolution processing of long video streams
is critical for future AI agents, yet current video-understanding LLMs struggle
to scale. Offline, fixed-frame-number methods require the stream length to
adapt frame rates; streaming methods constrain memory by merging or discarding
tokens, losing information. We propose video-SALMONN S, a streaming
audio-visual LLM that, to our knowledge, is the first to process 3-hour videos
at 1 FPS and 360p resolution under a fixed memory budget. Our model introduces
(i) a test-time-training (TTT) memory module that continually updates token
representations to capture long-range dependencies by replacing token merging,
and (ii) a prompt-dependent memory reader that selectively retrieves
context-relevant content from fixed-size memory. The TTT module is optimised
with a Hessian-free conjugate-gradient procedure (TTT_HF) for efficient
adaptation. On long-video benchmarks (Video-MME, LVBench, VideoEvalPro),
video-SALMONN S sustains high-quality understanding on multi-hour videos with
10k frames and 1M tokens. Our 8B-parameter model achieves 74.2% overall and
67.8% on the Video-MME long split, outperforming both offline and streaming
baselines.

Conclusion: 非破坏性方法为生殖医学提供实时精子选择，提升临床诊断和治疗。

Abstract: Sperm DNA fragmentation (SDF) is a critical parameter in male fertility
assessment that conventional semen analysis fails to evaluate. This study
presents the validation of a novel artificial intelligence (AI) tool designed
to detect SDF through digital analysis of phase contrast microscopy images,
using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL)
assay as the gold standard reference. Utilising the established link between
sperm morphology and DNA integrity, the present work proposes a morphology
assisted ensemble AI model that combines image processing techniques with
state-of-the-art transformer based machine learning models (GC-ViT) for the
prediction of DNA fragmentation in sperm from phase contrast images. The
ensemble model is benchmarked against a pure transformer `vision' model as well
as a `morphology-only` model. Promising results show the proposed framework is
able to achieve sensitivity of 60\% and specificity of 75\%. This
non-destructive methodology represents a significant advancement in
reproductive medicine by enabling real-time sperm selection based on DNA
integrity for clinical diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多视角流形证据融合方法（MMEFnet），用于融合PolSAR的协方差矩阵和多特征，提升分类的可靠性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统融合方法忽略了不同视角的几何结构差异和不确定性，导致预测不可靠。

Method: 利用HPD流形和Grassmann流形分别建模协方差矩阵和多特征，通过核度量学习网络学习流形表示，并基于Dempster-Shafer理论融合证据。

Result: 在三个真实PolSAR数据集上，MMEFnet在准确性、鲁棒性和可解释性上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMEFnet为PolSAR分类提供了一种可靠且可解释的融合框架。

Abstract: Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) covariance matrices and their
extracted multi-features - such as scattering angle, entropy, texture, and
boundary descriptors - provide complementary and physically interpretable
information for image classification. Traditional fusion strategies typically
concatenate these features or employ deep learning networks to combine them.
However, the covariance matrices and multi-features, as two complementary
views, lie on different manifolds with distinct geometric structures. Existing
fusion methods also overlook the varying importance of different views and
ignore uncertainty, often leading to unreliable predictions. To address these
issues, we propose a Multiview Manifold Evidential Fusion (MMEFnet) method to
effectively fuse these two views. It gives a new framework to integrate PolSAR
manifold learning and evidence fusion into a unified architecture.
Specifically, covariance matrices are represented on the Hermitian Positive
Definite (HPD) manifold, while multi-features are modeled on the Grassmann
manifold. Two different kernel metric learning networks are constructed to
learn their manifold representations. Subsequently, a trusted multiview
evidence fusion, replacing the conventional softmax classifier, estimates
belief mass and quantifies the uncertainty of each view from the learned deep
features. Finally, a Dempster-Shafer theory-based fusion strategy combines
evidence, enabling a more reliable and interpretable classification. Extensive
experiments on three real-world PolSAR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
method consistently outperforms existing approaches in accuracy, robustness,
and interpretability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoPRS提出了一种基于多模态思维链（MCoT）的位置感知模型，通过可微分和可解释的热图将语言推理与分割任务连接起来，提升了可解释性和分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理分割任务中直接将语言模型的隐藏特征连接到掩码解码器或仅表示文本位置，限制了可解释性和语义细节。

Method: CoPRS通过可学习的位置先验（热图）和轻量级解码器，将推理过程明确表达为密集且可微分的热图，从而连接推理与分割。

Result: 在RefCOCO系列和ReasonSeg数据集上，CoPRS在可比协议下达到或超过现有最佳性能。

Conclusion: 热图质量直接影响掩码质量，证明了推理与分割之间的强关联，展示了该范式在提升推理驱动分割精度方面的优势。

Abstract: Existing works on reasoning segmentation either connect hidden features from
a language model directly to a mask decoder or represent positions in text,
which limits interpretability and semantic detail. To solve this, we present
CoPRS, a Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT)-based positional perception model
that bridges language reasoning to segmentation through a differentiable and
interpretable positional prior instantiated as a heatmap. By making the
reasoning process clear via MCoT and expressing it as a dense, differentiable
heatmap, this interface enhances interpretability and diagnostic analysis and
yields more concentrated evidence on the target. A learnable concentration
token aggregates features of the image and reasoning text to generate this
positional prior, which is decoded to precise masks through a lightweight
decoder, providing a direct connection between reasoning and segmentation.
Across the RefCOCO series and ReasonSeg, CoPRS matches or surpasses the best
reported metrics on each standard split under comparable protocols, with
performance at or above prior state of the art across both validation and test
partitions. Extensive experiments reveal that the quality of the heatmap
strongly influences the resulting mask quality, supporting a consistent
association between the reasoning output and downstream mask generation.
Collectively, these findings support the utility of this paradigm in bridging
reasoning and segmentation and show advantages in concentration driven by
reasoning and predicting masks more precisely. Code, checkpoints and logs are
released at https://github.com/ZhenyuLU-Heliodore/CoPRS.git.

TL;DR: 论文提出PICO框架，通过抑制风格干扰来改进跨模态对齐任务，实验结果显示其性能优于现有方法5.2%-14.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法假设嵌入仅包含语义信息，忽略了风格信息的影响，导致信息偏差或丢失。

Method: 提出PICO框架，通过量化特征列的语义概率作为权重，并设计原型迭代构造方法确保语义概率的可靠性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型骨干上，PICO优于现有方法5.2%-14.1%。

Conclusion: PICO通过抑制风格干扰，有效提升了跨模态对齐任务的性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal alignment is an important multi-modal task, aiming to bridge the
semantic gap between different modalities. The most reliable fundamention for
achieving this objective lies in the semantic consistency between matched
pairs. Conventional methods implicitly assume embeddings contain solely
semantic information, ignoring the impact of non-semantic information during
alignment, which inevitably leads to information bias or even loss. These
non-semantic information primarily manifest as stylistic variations in the
data, which we formally define as style information. An intuitive approach is
to separate style from semantics, aligning only the semantic information.
However, most existing methods distinguish them based on feature columns, which
cannot represent the complex coupling relationship between semantic and style
information. In this paper, we propose PICO, a novel framework for suppressing
style interference during embedding interaction. Specifically, we quantify the
probability of each feature column representing semantic information, and
regard it as the weight during the embedding interaction. To ensure the
reliability of the semantic probability, we propose a prototype iterative
construction method. The key operation of this method is a performance
feedback-based weighting function, and we have theoretically proven that the
function can assign higher weight to prototypes that bring higher performance
improvements. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and model backbones
demonstrate the superiority of PICO, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by
5.2\%-14.1\%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决千亿级病理基础模型在开发和部署中的高计算成本问题。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，仅需1K目标癌症病理切片训练大规模模型。

Result: 蒸馏模型在多项基准测试中超越同规模模型，甚至部分超越千亿级模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为癌症特异性应用提供了一种数据和参数高效的高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Recent studies in pathology foundation models have shown that scaling
training data, diversifying cancer types, and increasing model size
consistently improve their performance. However, giga-scale foundation models,
which are trained on hundreds of thousands of slides covering tens of cancer
types and contain billions of parameters, pose significant challenges for
practical use due to their tremendous computational costs in both development
and deployment. In this work, we present a novel strategy, named the G2L
framework, to increase the performance of large-scale foundation models, which
consist of only $15\%$ of the parameters of giga-scale models, to a comparable
performance level of giga-scale models in cancer-specific tasks. Our approach
applies knowledge distillation, transferring the capabilities of a giga-scale
model to a large-scale model, using just 1K pathology slides of a target cancer
(e.g., breast, prostate, etc.). The resulting distilled model not only
outperformed state-of-the-art models of the same size (i.e., large-scale)
across several benchmarks but also, interestingly, surpassed the giga-scale
teacher and huge-scale models in some benchmarks. In addition, the distilled
model exhibited a higher robustness index, indicating improved resilience to
image variations originating from multiple institutions. These findings suggest
that the proposed distillation approach for a large-scale model is a data- and
parameter-efficient way to achieve giga-scale-level performance for
cancer-specific applications without prohibitive computational burden.

TL;DR: BLEnD-Vis是一个多模态、多文化的基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在日常文化知识中的鲁棒性，揭示了当前模型在文化理解和多模态整合上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估主要关注静态记忆或孤立视觉基础，缺乏对VLM文化理解能力的全面测试，因此需要开发一个更全面的基准。

Method: 基于BLEnD数据集，构建313个文化相关的问题模板，涵盖16个地区，生成三种多选格式（文本、反转文本和VQA风格），包含4,916张图片和21,000多个问题实例。

Result: 当前VLM在文化知识上表现脆弱，语言改写导致性能下降，视觉线索虽有助于表现，但跨模态一致性低，尤其在低资源地区。

Conclusion: BLEnD-Vis为系统分析文化鲁棒性和多模态基础提供了关键测试平台，指导开发更具文化能力的VLM。

Abstract: As vision-language models (VLMs) are deployed globally, their ability to
understand culturally situated knowledge becomes essential. Yet, existing
evaluations largely assess static recall or isolated visual grounding, leaving
unanswered whether VLMs possess robust and transferable cultural understanding.
We introduce BLEnD-Vis, a multimodal, multicultural benchmark designed to
evaluate the robustness of everyday cultural knowledge in VLMs across
linguistic rephrasings and visual modalities. Building on the BLEnD dataset,
BLEnD-Vis constructs 313 culturally grounded question templates spanning 16
regions and generates three aligned multiple-choice formats: (i) a text-only
baseline querying from Region $\to$ Entity, (ii) an inverted text-only variant
(Entity $\to$ Region), and (iii) a VQA-style version of (ii) with generated
images. The resulting benchmark comprises 4,916 images and over 21,000
multiple-choice question (MCQ) instances, validated through human annotation.
BLEnD-Vis reveals significant fragility in current VLM cultural knowledge;
models exhibit performance drops under linguistic rephrasing and, whilst visual
cues often aid performance, low cross-modal consistency highlights challenges
in robustly integrating textual and visual understanding, particularly for
lower-resource regions. BLEnD-Vis thus provides a crucial testbed for
systematically analysing cultural robustness and multimodal grounding, exposing
limitations and guiding the development of more culturally competent VLMs.

Abstract: This paper explores the application of T5 models for Saudi Sign Language
(SSL) translation using a novel dataset. The SSL dataset includes three
challenging testing protocols, enabling comprehensive evaluation across
different scenarios. Additionally, it captures unique SSL characteristics, such
as face coverings, which pose challenges for sign recognition and translation.
In our experiments, we investigate the impact of pre-training on American Sign
Language (ASL) data by comparing T5 models pre-trained on the YouTubeASL
dataset with models trained directly on the SSL dataset. Experimental results
demonstrate that pre-training on YouTubeASL significantly improves models'
performance (roughly $3\times$ in BLEU-4), indicating cross-linguistic
transferability in sign language models. Our findings highlight the benefits of
leveraging large-scale ASL data to improve SSL translation and provide insights
into the development of more effective sign language translation systems. Our
code is publicly available at our GitHub repository.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏对联想推理强度的灵活调节，限制了模型在事实性和创造性任务中的适应性。

Method: 提出FlexAC框架，通过中间层表示修改和任务特定联想向量，动态调节联想推理强度。

Result: 在Creation-MMBench上创造力提升5.8倍，CHAIR上幻觉率降低29%。

Conclusion: FlexAC有效实现了对MLLMs联想推理的灵活控制，平衡了创造性与忠实性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) face an inherent trade-off between
faithfulness and creativity, as different tasks require varying degrees of
associative reasoning. However, existing methods lack the flexibility to
modulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual
and creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with
mechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by
investigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs
and find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's
associative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers
effectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations
can be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.
Building on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),
a lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior
in MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate
representations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects
high-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,
whose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with
output stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of
associative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors
derived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to
follow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.
Notably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on
Creation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing
existing baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible
control over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at

Result: 在APPROVE数据集上优于基线模型，并在Youtube-8M和COIN等基准测试中表现良好。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别视频中的教育内容，为教育者提供实用工具。

Abstract: The recent growth in the consumption of online media by children during early
childhood necessitates data-driven tools enabling educators to filter out
appropriate educational content for young learners. This paper presents an
approach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two
widely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we
choose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For
example, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes
include `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel
classification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational
content and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'
vs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised
contrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated
with multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss
function is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and
the samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and
the samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual
and audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a
multimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and
audio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos. For evaluation,
we present a dataset, APPROVE, employing educational videos from YouTube
labeled with fine-grained education classes by education researchers. APPROVE
consists of 193 hours of expert-annotated videos with 19 classes. The proposed
approach outperforms strong baselines on APPROVE and other benchmarks such as
Youtube-8M, and COIN. The dataset is available at

Result: 在1,429名说话者中达到61.14%的识别准确率，证明动态特征具有身份标识性。

Conclusion: 面部动态包含个体特征，形状分离的稳定性影响识别效果。

Abstract: This work investigates whether individuals can be identified solely through
the pure dynamical components of their facial expressions, independent of
static facial appearance. We leverage the FLAME 3D morphable model to achieve
explicit disentanglement between facial shape and expression dynamics,
extracting frame-by-frame parameters from conversational videos while retaining
only expression and jaw coefficients. On the CANDOR dataset of 1,429 speakers
in naturalistic conversations, our Conformer model with supervised contrastive
learning achieves 61.14\%accuracy on 1,429-way classification -- 458 times
above chance -- demonstrating that facial dynamics carry strong identity
signatures. We introduce a drift-to-noise ratio (DNR) that quantifies the
reliability of shape expression separation by measuring across-session shape
changes relative to within-session variability. DNR strongly negatively
correlates with recognition performance, confirming that unstable shape
estimation compromises dynamic identification. Our findings reveal
person-specific signatures in conversational facial dynamics, with implications
for social perception and clinical assessment.

Method: 使用自定义的四层卷积块架构，训练于5,856张胸片，预处理包括图像调整、灰度转换和数据增强。

Result: 在测试集上准确率0.942，召回率0.99，模型仅1.48MB。

Conclusion: LightPneumoNet高效且准确，适合低硬件成本部署。

Abstract: Effective pneumonia diagnosis is often challenged by the difficulty of
deploying large, computationally expensive deep learning models in
resource-limited settings. This study introduces LightPneumoNet, an efficient,
lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) built from scratch to provide an
accessible and accurate diagnostic solution for pneumonia detection from chest
X-rays. Our model was trained on a public dataset of 5,856 chest X-ray images.
Preprocessing included image resizing to 224x224, grayscale conversion, and
pixel normalization, with data augmentation (rotation, zoom, shear) to prevent
overfitting. The custom architecture features four blocks of stacked
convolutional layers and contains only 388,082 trainable parameters, resulting
in a minimal 1.48 MB memory footprint. On the independent test set, our model
delivered exceptional performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 0.942,
precision of 0.92, and an F1-Score of 0.96. Critically, it obtained a
sensitivity (recall) of 0.99, demonstrating a near-perfect ability to identify
true pneumonia cases and minimize clinically significant false negatives.
Notably, LightPneumoNet achieves this high recall on the same dataset where
existing approaches typically require significantly heavier architectures or
fail to reach comparable sensitivity levels. The model's efficiency enables
deployment on low-cost hardware, making advanced computer-aided diagnosis
accessible in underserved clinics and serving as a reliable second-opinion tool

of 36 gesture classes with 1,500 samples per class, designed to capture the
structural and visual features of the language. To evaluate recognition
performance, we fine-tuned MobileNetV2 and ResNet50 architectures on the
dataset, achieving classification accuracies of 90.45% and 88.78%,
respectively. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of convolutional
neural networks in sign recognition tasks, particularly within low-resource
settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first
systematic effort to construct a benchmark dataset and assess deep learning
approaches for NSL recognition, highlighting the potential of transfer learning
and fine-tuning for advancing research in underexplored sign languages.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂临床场景中因结构表示不足和上下文建模不充分而泛化能力差。

Method: 提出DTEA模型，包含STR模块（动态超图重组多尺度语义特征）和EPG模块（过滤高熵通道以增强空间注意力）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上表现出更高的分割精度和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: DTEA模型通过改进跳跃连接框架，显著提升了医学图像分割的性能和临床适用性。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation, skip connections are used to merge global
context and reduce the semantic gap between encoder and decoder. Current
methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient
contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We
propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the
Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG)
modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic
hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing
structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after
perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically
important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three
benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy
and better generalization across various clinical settings. The code is

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态自动标尺检测与提取框架，结合LLM代理，显著提高了SEM图像分析的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SEM图像标尺检测主要依赖手动操作，耗时且易出错，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用四阶段框架：自动数据集生成、标尺检测、混合OCR信息提取、LLM代理验证。

Result: 目标检测精度100%，召回率95.8%；OCR系统F1分数75%，优于主流独立引擎。

Conclusion: 该自动化方法为显微分析提供了高效工具，推动了科学成像领域的发展。

Abstract: Microscopic characterizations, such as Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM),
are widely used in scientific research for visualizing and analyzing
microstructures. Determining the scale bars is an important first step of
accurate SEM analysis; however, currently, it mainly relies on manual
operations, which is both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address this
issue, we propose a multi-modal and automated scale bar detection and
extraction framework that provides concurrent object detection, text detection
and text recognition with a Large Language Model (LLM) agent. The proposed
framework operates in four phases; i) Automatic Dataset Generation (Auto-DG)
model to synthesize a diverse dataset of SEM images ensuring robust training
and high generalizability of the model, ii) scale bar object detection, iii)
information extraction using a hybrid Optical Character Recognition (OCR)
system with DenseNet and Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) based
algorithms, iv) an LLM agent to analyze and verify accuracy of the results. The
proposed model demonstrates a strong performance in object detection and
accurate localization with a precision of 100%, recall of 95.8%, and a mean
Average Precision (mAP) of 99.2% at IoU=0.5 and 69.1% at IoU=0.5:0.95. The
hybrid OCR system achieved 89% precision, 65% recall, and a 75% F1 score on the
Auto-DG dataset, significantly outperforming several mainstream standalone
engines, highlighting its reliability for scientific image analysis. The LLM is
introduced as a reasoning engine as well as an intelligent assistant that
suggests follow-up steps and verifies the results. This automated method
powered by an LLM agent significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of
scale bar detection and extraction in SEM images, providing a valuable tool for
microscopic analysis and advancing the field of scientific imaging.

Motivation: 现有分类器编辑方法要么局限于错误修正，要么需要大量重训练成本，缺乏灵活性，尤其在图像分类中研究较少。

Method: 引入Class Vectors，捕捉类特定表示调整，支持潜在空间或权重空间的分类器编辑。

Result: Class Vectors能有效捕捉语义变化，支持高效、灵活的类算术编辑，并在多种应用中验证其有效性。

Conclusion: Class Vectors为图像分类器编辑提供了一种高效、灵活的新方法，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Image classifiers play a critical role in detecting diseases in medical
imaging and identifying anomalies in manufacturing processes. However, their
predefined behaviors after extensive training make post hoc model editing
difficult, especially when it comes to forgetting specific classes or adapting
to distribution shifts. Existing classifier editing methods either focus
narrowly on correcting errors or incur extensive retraining costs, creating a
bottleneck for flexible editing. Moreover, such editing has seen limited
investigation in image classification. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce Class Vectors, which capture class-specific representation
adjustments during fine-tuning. Whereas task vectors encode task-level changes
in weight space, Class Vectors disentangle each class's adaptation in the
latent space. We show that Class Vectors capture each class's semantic shift
and that classifier editing can be achieved either by steering latent features
along these vectors or by mapping them into weight space to update the decision
boundaries. We also demonstrate that the inherent linearity and orthogonality
of Class Vectors support efficient, flexible, and high-level concept editing
via simple class arithmetic. Finally, we validate their utility in applications
such as unlearning, environmental adaptation, adversarial defense, and
adversarial trigger optimization.

ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion
Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU,

TL;DR: HaDola框架通过数据选择和自动标注减少对人工标注的依赖，提升视觉语言模型的性能和校准性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类不确定性（HU）对监督微调（SFT）的影响，并提出有效利用HU的方法。

Method: 提出HaDola框架，包含四个阶段：区分、自标注、错误触发和训练，以迭代优化数据选择。

Result: 在VQAv2和VizWiz数据集上，HaDola以更少数据匹配或超越现有基线。

Conclusion: 显式建模HU比单纯扩大数据集更有效，HaDola为利用HU提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance in Visual
Question Answering but still rely heavily on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
massive labeled datasets, which is costly due to human annotations. Crucially,
real-world datasets often exhibit human uncertainty (HU) -- variation in human
confidence across annotations -- but standard SFT simply optimizes toward the
most frequent label, disregarding HU distributions. This leaves two open
questions: How does HU affect SFT, and how can HU be effectively leveraged in
training? In this work, we first conduct a systematic evaluation of VLMs across
varying HU levels. We have two key findings: (i) surprisingly, high-HU samples
contribute little or even degrade model performance, and (ii) naively training
on the full dataset yields under-calibrated models that fail to capture HU
distributions. Motivated by these findings, we introduce HaDola, a human
uncertainty-aware data selection and automatic labeling framework. HaDola
operates in four stages -- discriminate, self-annotate, error trigger, and
training -- to iteratively identify harmful samples, prioritize informative
ones, and bootstrap from a small seed set (5\% of data). Our approach
substantially reduces reliance on costly HU annotations and makes VLMs more
accurate and better calibrated. Extensive experiments on VQAv2 and VizWiz
datasets demonstrate that HaDola consistently matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines with less training data. Our work highlights the
importance of explicitly modeling HU in SFT, suggesting that better utilization
of HU is more effective than merely scaling up dataset size.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ΔEnergy的新型OOD评分方法，通过重新对齐视觉语言模态显著提升OOD检测性能，并同时改善协变量偏移下的OOD泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，视觉语言模型（VLMs）会遇到分布内（ID）和分布外（OOD）数据，其中OOD数据包括协变量偏移和语义偏移。提升VLMs对协变量偏移的泛化能力并有效检测开放集语义偏移的OOD类别至关重要。

Method: 提出ΔEnergy作为OOD评分方法，通过降低最大余弦相似度来重新对齐视觉语言模态，并设计EBM（ΔEnergy的下界最大化）来提升OOD泛化能力。

Result: 在OOD检测和泛化基准测试中，ΔEnergy显著优于现有方法，AUROC提升10%至25%。

Conclusion: 论文提出的统一微调框架显著提升了VLMs在OOD检测和泛化中的鲁棒性，为实际应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Recent approaches for vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable
success in achieving fast downstream adaptation. When applied to real-world
downstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data
and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both
covariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and
semantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the
importance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD
data, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In
this paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set
data when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly
reducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel
OOD score, named {\Delta}Energy. {\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the
vanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD
detection. Furthermore, {\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD
generalization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound
maximization for {\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to
not only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,
which serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this
finding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving
VLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection. Extensive
experiments on challenging OOD detection and generalization benchmarks
demonstrate the superiority of our method, outperforming recent approaches by
10% to 25% in AUROC.

Motivation: 传统监督学习需要大量标注成本，而零样本VLM虽然免标注但精度较低。本文旨在量化比较两者的成本效益，为架构选择提供依据。

Method: 通过系统评估1,000张COCO图像和200张多样化产品图像，结合总拥有成本建模，建立定量断点阈值。

Result: 监督YOLO在标准类别上精度91.2%，零样本Gemini为68.5%，但后者在未训练类别上表现更好且成本更低。

Conclusion: 最优架构选择取决于部署规模、类别稳定性、预算和精度需求，而非单纯技术指标。

Abstract: Object detection systems have traditionally relied on supervised learning
with manually annotated bounding boxes, achieving high accuracy at the cost of
substantial annotation investment. The emergence of Vision-Language Models
(VLMs) offers an alternative paradigm enabling zero-shot detection through
natural language queries, eliminating annotation requirements but operating
with reduced accuracy. This paper presents the first comprehensive
cost-effectiveness analysis comparing supervised detection (YOLO) with
zero-shot VLM inference (Gemini Flash 2.5). Through systematic evaluation on
1,000 stratified COCO images and 200 diverse product images spanning consumer
electronics and rare categories, combined with detailed Total Cost of Ownership
modeling, we establish quantitative break-even thresholds governing
architecture selection. Our findings reveal that supervised YOLO achieves 91.2%
accuracy versus 68.5% for zero-shot Gemini on standard categories, representing
a 22.7 percentage point advantage that costs $10,800 in annotation for
100-category systems. However, this advantage justifies investment only beyond
55 million inferences, equivalent to 151,000 images daily for one year.
Zero-shot Gemini demonstrates 52.3% accuracy on diverse product categories
(ranging from highly web-prevalent consumer electronics at 75-85% to rare
specialized equipment at 25-40%) where supervised YOLO achieves 0% due to
architectural constraints preventing detection of untrained classes. Cost per
Correct Detection analysis reveals substantially lower per-detection costs for
Gemini ($0.00050 vs $0.143) at 100,000 inferences despite accuracy deficits. We
develop decision frameworks demonstrating that optimal architecture selection
depends critically on deployment volume, category stability, budget
constraints, and accuracy requirements rather than purely technical performance
metrics.

Conclusion: Sketch2Symm通过语义和几何增强，显著提升了基于草图的3D重建性能。

Abstract: Sketch-based 3D reconstruction remains a challenging task due to the abstract
and sparse nature of sketch inputs, which often lack sufficient semantic and
geometric information. To address this, we propose Sketch2Symm, a two-stage
generation method that produces geometrically consistent 3D shapes from
sketches. Our approach introduces semantic bridging via sketch-to-image
translation to enrich sparse sketch representations, and incorporates symmetry
constraints as geometric priors to leverage the structural regularity commonly
found in everyday objects. Experiments on mainstream sketch datasets
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to existing
sketch-based reconstruction methods in terms of Chamfer Distance, Earth Mover's
Distance, and F-Score, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed semantic
bridging and symmetry-aware design.

Abstract: Flood mapping and water depth estimation from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
imagery are crucial for calibrating and validating hydraulic models. This study
uses SAR imagery to evaluate various preprocessing (especially speckle noise
reduction), flood mapping, and water depth estimation methods. The impact of
the choice of method at different steps and its hyperparameters is studied by
considering an ensemble of preprocessed images, flood maps, and water depth
fields. The evaluation is conducted for two flood events on the Garonne River
(France) in 2019 and 2021, using hydrodynamic simulations and in-situ
observations as reference data. Results show that the choice of speckle filter
alters flood extent estimations with variations of several square kilometers.
Furthermore, the selection and tuning of flood mapping methods also affect
performance. While supervised methods outperformed unsupervised ones, tuned
unsupervised approaches (such as local thresholding or change detection) can
achieve comparable results. The compounded uncertainty from preprocessing and
flood mapping steps also introduces high variability in the water depth field
estimates. This study highlights the importance of considering the entire
processing pipeline, encompassing preprocessing, flood mapping, and water depth
estimation methods and their associated hyperparameters. Rather than relying on
a single configuration, adopting an ensemble approach and accounting for
methodological uncertainty should be privileged. For flood mapping, the method
choice has the most influence. For water depth estimation, the most influential
processing step was the flood map input resulting from the flood mapping step
and the hyperparameters of the methods.

Conclusion: InternSVG通过统一建模和多模态大语言模型的有效利用，显著提升了SVG任务的性能。

Abstract: General SVG modeling remains challenging due to fragmented datasets, limited
transferability of methods across tasks, and the difficulty of handling
structural complexity. In response, we leverage the strong transfer and
generalization capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
achieve unified modeling for SVG understanding, editing, and generation. We
present the InternSVG family, an integrated data-benchmark-model suite. At its
core is SAgoge, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal dataset for SVG
tasks, encompassing both static graphics and dynamic animations. It covers
icons, long-sequence illustrations, scientific diagrams, and dynamic
animations, supporting tasks of varied difficulty levels and providing deeper
hierarchies with richer attributes compared to previous datasets. Based on this
resource, we introduce SArena, a companion benchmark with comprehensive task
definitions and standardized evaluation that aligns with the domains and
difficulty spectrum covered by SAgoge. Building on these foundations, we
propose InternSVG, a unified MLLM for SVG understanding, editing, and
generation with SVG-specific special tokens, subword-based embedding
initialization, and a two-stage training strategy that progresses from short
static SVGs to long-sequence illustrations and complex animations. This unified
formulation induces positive transfer and improves overall performance.
Experiments on SArena and prior benchmark confirm that InternSVG achieves
substantial gains and consistently outperforms leading open and proprietary
counterparts.

Result: MMAP在多个评估指标（MAE、MSE、PCC）上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MMAP通过同时优化局部和全局信息，显著提升了从H&E图像预测基因表达的准确性。

Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) enables the measurement of gene expression while
preserving spatial information, offering critical insights into tissue
architecture and disease pathology. Recent developments have explored the use
of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict
transcriptome-wide gene expression profiles through deep neural networks. This
task is commonly framed as a regression problem, where each input corresponds
to a localized image patch extracted from the WSI. However, predicting spatial
gene expression from histological images remains a challenging problem due to
the significant modality gap between visual features and molecular signals.
Recent studies have attempted to incorporate both local and global information
into predictive models. Nevertheless, existing methods still suffer from two
key limitations: (1) insufficient granularity in local feature extraction, and
(2) inadequate coverage of global spatial context. In this work, we propose a
novel framework, MMAP (Multi-MAgnification and Prototype-enhanced
architecture), that addresses both challenges simultaneously. To enhance local
feature granularity, MMAP leverages multi-magnification patch representations
that capture fine-grained histological details. To improve global contextual
understanding, it learns a set of latent prototype embeddings that serve as
compact representations of slide-level information. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that MMAP consistently outperforms all existing
state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Pearson Correlation
Coefficient (PCC).

Result: 在视网膜OCT和交通场景实验中，生成的合成数据显著提升了分割性能，无需额外监督。

Conclusion: 不确定性引导的方法优于风格迁移，能够处理任意域偏移，无需严格学习图像风格。

Abstract: Generative Models are a valuable tool for the controlled creation of
high-quality image data. Controlled diffusion models like the ControlNet have
allowed the creation of labeled distributions. Such synthetic datasets can
augment the original training distribution when discriminative models, like
semantic segmentation, are trained. However, this augmentation effect is
limited since ControlNets tend to reproduce the original training distribution.
  This work introduces a method to utilize data from unlabeled domains to train
ControlNets by introducing the concept of uncertainty into the control
mechanism. The uncertainty indicates that a given image was not part of the
training distribution of a downstream task, e.g., segmentation. Thus, two types
of control are engaged in the final network: an uncertainty control from an
unlabeled dataset and a semantic control from the labeled dataset. The
resulting ControlNet allows us to create annotated data with high uncertainty
from the target domain, i.e., synthetic data from the unlabeled distribution
with labels. In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically
high-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth
segmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent
development in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower
quality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation
networks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images
from the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads
to significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further
supervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when
compared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any
strict learning of an image style. This is also demonstrated in a traffic scene
experiment.

Conclusion: RALI通过消除对推理过程的依赖，显著提升了效率，为IQA模型的部署提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-based image quality assessment (IQA) models trained through
reinforcement learning (RL) exhibit exceptional generalization, yet the
underlying mechanisms and critical factors driving this capability remain
underexplored in current research. Moreover, despite their superior
performance, these models incur inference energy usage and latency orders of
magnitude higher than their earlier counterparts, restricting their deployment
in specific scenarios. Through extensive experiments, this paper verifies and
elaborates that through RL training, MLLMs leverage their reasoning capability
to convert redundant visual representations into compact, cross-domain aligned
text representations. This conversion is precisely the source of the
generalization exhibited by these reasoning-based IQA models. Building on this
fundamental insight, we propose a novel algorithm, RALI, which employs
contrastive learning to directly align images with these generalizable text
representations learned by RL. This approach eliminates the reliance on
reasoning processes and even obviates the need to load an LLM. For the quality
scoring task, this framework achieves generalization performance comparable to
reasoning-based models while requiring less than 5% of their model parameters
and inference time.

Abstract: Modeling reflections from 2D images is essential for photorealistic rendering
and novel view synthesis. Recent approaches enhance Gaussian primitives with
reflection-related material attributes to enable physically based rendering
(PBR) with Gaussian Splatting. However, the material inference often lacks
sufficient constraints, especially under limited environment modeling,
resulting in illumination aliasing and reduced generalization. In this work, we
revisit the problem from a multi-view perspective and show that multi-view
consistent material inference with more physically-based environment modeling
is key to learning accurate reflections with Gaussian Splatting. To this end,
we enforce 2D Gaussians to produce multi-view consistent material maps during
deferred shading. We also track photometric variations across views to identify
highly reflective regions, which serve as strong priors for reflection strength
terms. To handle indirect illumination caused by inter-object occlusions, we
further introduce an environment modeling strategy through ray tracing with
2DGS, enabling photorealistic rendering of indirect radiance. Experiments on
widely used benchmarks show that our method faithfully recovers both
illumination and geometry, achieving state-of-the-art rendering quality in
novel views synthesis.

TL;DR: DocReward是一种评估文档结构和风格的奖励模型，显著优于GPT-4o和GPT-5，并能有效指导生成更符合人类偏好的文档。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代理工作流主要关注文本质量，忽略了视觉结构和风格对文档可读性和吸引力的重要性，缺乏合适的奖励模型来引导高质量文档生成。

Method: 构建多领域数据集DocPair，包含117K对文档，使用Bradley-Terry损失训练DocReward模型，评估文档的专业性。

Result: DocReward在测试数据集上比GPT-4o和GPT-5分别高出30.6和19.4个百分点，在文档生成任务中胜率达到60.8%。

Conclusion: DocReward能有效评估和引导文档生成，提升文档的结构和风格质量，优于现有基线模型。

Abstract: Recent advances in agentic workflows have enabled the automation of tasks
such as professional document generation. However, they primarily focus on
textual quality, neglecting visual structure and style, which are crucial for
readability and engagement. This gap arises mainly from the absence of suitable
reward models to guide agentic workflows toward producing documents with
stronger structural and stylistic quality. To address this, we propose
DocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their
structure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired
documents, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-
and low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure
and style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,
and in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the
Bradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict
the annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a
test dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human
evaluators. Notably, DocReward outperforms GPT-4o and GPT-5 in accuracy by 30.6
and 19.4 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over
baselines. In an extrinsic evaluation of document generation, DocReward
achieves a significantly higher win rate of 60.8%, compared to GPT-5's 37.7%
win rate, demonstrating its utility in guiding generation agents toward
producing human-preferred documents.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于SAM 2的长期记忆框架LM-EEC，用于解决自我-外部视角（EEC）任务中的特征融合和长期记忆问题，并在EgoExo4D基准测试中取得了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自我-外部视角（EEC）任务在智能助手中至关重要，但面临视角变化、遮挡和小物体等挑战。现有方法效果不佳，而SAM 2在直接应用时也因特征融合和长期记忆问题表现不佳。

Method: 提出了基于SAM 2的LM-EEC框架，包括双记忆架构和自适应特征路由模块（Memory-View MoE），以及双记忆库系统。

Result: 在EgoExo4D基准测试中，LM-EEC显著优于现有方法和SAM 2基线，展示了其强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: LM-EEC通过创新的双记忆架构和自适应特征路由模块，有效解决了EEC任务中的挑战，成为新的最先进方法。

Abstract: Establishing object-level correspondence between egocentric and exocentric
views is essential for intelligent assistants to deliver precise and intuitive
visual guidance. However, this task faces numerous challenges, including
extreme viewpoint variations, occlusions, and the presence of small objects.
Existing approaches usually borrow solutions from video object segmentation
models, but still suffer from the aforementioned challenges. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has shown strong generalization capabilities
and excellent performance in video object segmentation. Yet, when simply
applied to the ego-exo correspondence (EEC) task, SAM 2 encounters severe
difficulties due to ineffective ego-exo feature fusion and limited long-term
memory capacity, especially for long videos. Addressing these problems, we
propose a novel EEC framework based on SAM 2 with long-term memories by
presenting a dual-memory architecture and an adaptive feature routing module
inspired by Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). Compared to SAM 2, our approach features
(i) a Memory-View MoE module which consists of a dual-branch routing mechanism
to adaptively assign contribution weights to each expert feature along both
channel and spatial dimensions, and (ii) a dual-memory bank system with a
simple yet effective compression strategy to retain critical long-term
information while eliminating redundancy. In the extensive experiments on the
challenging EgoExo4D benchmark, our method, dubbed LM-EEC, achieves new
state-of-the-art results and significantly outperforms existing methods and the
SAM 2 baseline, showcasing its strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合高分辨率卫星图像和AIS数据的新框架，用于内河水域的海事感知，显著提升了船舶检测和分类的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AIS系统在内河水域监测中的局限性，通过非合作卫星图像与AIS数据融合，提升海事感知能力。

Method: 使用YOLO v11模型检测船舶，结合卫星图像和AIS数据，开发了包含4550个实例的数据集。

Result: 船舶分类F1分数达95.8%，方向性准确率93.8%，空间可转移性高达98%。

Conclusion: 该方法可行，支持实时监测和异常检测，未来将扩展数据集并探索多模态深度学习。

Abstract: Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by
cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that
fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the
Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of
AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and
implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to
identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA.
The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and
characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational
status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550
instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River
imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification
(tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1
score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1
score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification
reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded
93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically
disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These
results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite
sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet
inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for
inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets,
incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further
enhance operational scalability.

Method: 提出了VGDCFusion网络，包含SPDCE（模态特定退化感知与联合建模）和JPDCF（跨模态退化感知与特征融合），结合视觉语言模型进行引导。

Result: 实验表明，VGDCFusion在多种退化图像场景下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VGDCFusion通过紧密耦合退化建模与融合过程，有效提升了退化图像融合的性能。

Abstract: Existing Infrared and Visible Image Fusion (IVIF) methods typically assume
high-quality inputs. However, when handing degraded images, these methods
heavily rely on manually switching between different pre-processing techniques.
This decoupling of degradation handling and image fusion leads to significant
performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel VLM-Guided
Degradation-Coupled Fusion network (VGDCFusion), which tightly couples
degradation modeling with the fusion process and leverages vision-language
models (VLMs) for degradation-aware perception and guided suppression.
Specifically, the proposed Specific-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Extractor
(SPDCE) enables modality-specific degradation awareness and establishes a joint
modeling of degradation suppression and intra-modal feature extraction. In
parallel, the Joint-Prompt Degradation-Coupled Fusion (JPDCF) facilitates
cross-modal degradation perception and couples residual degradation filtering
with complementary cross-modal feature fusion. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our VGDCFusion significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art fusion approaches under various degraded image scenarios. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Lmmh058/VGDCFusion.

Result: 在标准基准测试中，该方法在表面重建和新视角合成方面均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过多视角几何约束和特征嵌入，显著提升了3D高斯分布的几何表示能力。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has recently emerged as an efficient solution for
high-quality and real-time novel view synthesis. However, its capability for
accurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and
unstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering
loss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.
In this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric
representation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we
incorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface
boundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we
introduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions
and encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further
mitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based
constraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local
surface estimation. Additionally, we leverage deep image feature embeddings to
enforce cross-view consistency, enhancing the robustness of the learned
geometry under varying viewpoints and illumination. Extensive experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both surface reconstruction and novel view synthesis. The source

Conclusion: 该方法显著提高了法线积分的效率和可扩展性，适用于大分辨率法线图。

Abstract: Surface normal integration is a fundamental problem in computer vision,
dealing with the objective of reconstructing a surface from its corresponding
normal map. Existing approaches require an iterative global optimization to
jointly estimate the depth of each pixel, which scales poorly to larger normal
maps. In this paper, we address this problem by recasting normal integration as
the estimation of relative scales of continuous components. By constraining
pixels belonging to the same component to jointly vary their scale, we
drastically reduce the number of optimization variables. Our framework includes
a heuristic to accurately estimate continuous components from the start, a
strategy to rebalance optimization terms, and a technique to iteratively merge
components to further reduce the size of the problem. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art results on the standard normal integration benchmark in as
little as a few seconds and achieves one-order-of-magnitude speedup over
pixel-level approaches on large-resolution normal maps.

Motivation: 现有3D数据集和评估基准对动态场景和情境的孤立处理导致理解不完整，需更全面的数据集和方法。

Result: 数据集包含121K问答对、36K变化描述和17K重排指令，SCReasoner在任务中表现高效。

Conclusion: Situat3DChange为动态场景理解提供了有效训练数据，但MLLMs仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Physical environments and circumstances are fundamentally dynamic, yet
current 3D datasets and evaluation benchmarks tend to concentrate on either
dynamic scenarios or dynamic situations in isolation, resulting in incomplete
comprehension. To overcome these constraints, we introduce Situat3DChange, an
extensive dataset supporting three situation-aware change understanding tasks
following the perception-action model: 121K question-answer pairs, 36K change
descriptions for perception tasks, and 17K rearrangement instructions for the
action task. To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages
11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental
models and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These
observations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as
categorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to
support understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of
comparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we
propose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point
cloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens
required for the language decoder. Comprehensive evaluation on Situat3DChange
tasks highlights both the progress and limitations of MLLMs in dynamic scene
and situation understanding. Additional experiments on data scaling and
cross-domain transfer demonstrate the task-agnostic effectiveness of using
Situat3DChange as a training dataset for MLLMs.

Abstract: Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.

Abstract: Walking assistance in extreme or complex environments remains a significant

lack of a holistic scene understanding. Motivated by the real-world needs of
the BLV community, we build mmWalk, a simulated multi-modal dataset that
integrates multi-view sensor and accessibility-oriented features for outdoor
safe navigation. Our dataset comprises 120 manually controlled,
scenario-categorized walking trajectories with 62k synchronized frames. It
contains over 559k panoramic images across RGB, depth, and semantic modalities.
Furthermore, to emphasize real-world relevance, each trajectory involves
outdoor corner cases and accessibility-specific landmarks for BLV users.
Additionally, we generate mmWalkVQA, a VQA benchmark with over 69k visual
question-answer triplets across 9 categories tailored for safe and informed
walking assistance. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
using zero- and few-shot settings and found they struggle with our risk
assessment and navigational tasks. We validate our mmWalk-finetuned model on
real-world datasets and show the effectiveness of our dataset for advancing

Conclusion: MAs在局部细节合成中起关键作用，DG策略能有效增强DiTs的细节生成能力。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone
for visual generation. Recent observations reveal \emph{Massive Activations}
(MAs) in their internal feature maps, yet their function remains poorly
understood. In this work, we systematically investigate these activations to
elucidate their role in visual generation. We found that these massive
activations occur across all spatial tokens, and their distribution is
modulated by the input timestep embeddings. Importantly, our investigations
further demonstrate that these massive activations play a key role in local
detail synthesis, while having minimal impact on the overall semantic content
of output. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{D}etail
\textbf{G}uidance (\textbf{DG}), a MAs-driven, training-free self-guidance
strategy to explicitly enhance local detail fidelity for DiTs. Specifically, DG
constructs a degraded ``detail-deficient'' model by disrupting MAs and
leverages it to guide the original network toward higher-quality detail
synthesis. Our DG can seamlessly integrate with Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG),
enabling further refinements of fine-grained details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our DG consistently improves fine-grained detail quality
across various pre-trained DiTs (\eg, SD3, SD3.5, and Flux).

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在传统2D图像理解上表现优异，但在全方位图像（ODI）理解方面尚未充分探索。

Method: 构建了包含2000张ODI和4000个QA对的ODI-Bench基准，并提出训练无关的Omni-CoT方法，通过思维链推理提升模型表现。

Result: 实验表明现有模型在ODI理解上仍有困难，Omni-CoT显著提升了模型性能。

Conclusion: ODI-Bench和Omni-CoT为全方位图像理解提供了重要工具，未来可进一步优化模型表现。

Abstract: Omnidirectional images (ODIs) provide full 360x180 view which are widely
adopted in VR, AR and embodied intelligence applications. While multi-modal
large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on
conventional 2D image and video understanding benchmarks, their ability to
comprehend the immersive environments captured by ODIs remains largely
unexplored. To address this gap, we first present ODI-Bench, a novel
comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for omnidirectional image
understanding. ODI-Bench contains 2,000 high-quality omnidirectional images and
over 4,000 manually annotated question-answering (QA) pairs across 10
fine-grained tasks, covering both general-level and spatial-level ODI
understanding. Extensive experiments are conducted to benchmark 20
representative MLLMs, including proprietary and open-source models, under both
close-ended and open-ended settings. Experimental results reveal that current
MLLMs still struggle to capture the immersive context provided by ODIs. To this
end, we further introduce Omni-CoT, a training-free method which significantly
enhances MLLMs' comprehension ability in the omnidirectional environment
through chain-of-thought reasoning across both textual information and visual
cues. Both the benchmark and the code will be released upon the publication.

Abstract: Chest X-ray classification is vital yet resource-intensive, typically
demanding extensive annotated data for accurate diagnosis. Foundation models
mitigate this reliance, but how many labeled samples are required remains
unclear. We systematically evaluate the use of power-law fits to predict the
training size necessary for specific ROC-AUC thresholds. Testing multiple
pathologies and foundation models, we find XrayCLIP and XraySigLIP achieve
strong performance with significantly fewer labeled examples than a ResNet-50
baseline. Importantly, learning curve slopes from just 50 labeled cases
accurately forecast final performance plateaus. Our results enable
practitioners to minimize annotation costs by labeling only the essential

Abstract: Interactive 3D point cloud segmentation enables efficient annotation of
complex 3D scenes through user-guided prompts. However, current approaches are
typically restricted in scope to a single domain (indoor or outdoor), and to a
single form of user interaction (either spatial clicks or textual prompts).
Moreover, training on multiple datasets often leads to negative transfer,
resulting in domain-specific tools that lack generalizability. To address these
limitations, we present \textbf{SNAP} (\textbf{S}egment a\textbf{N}ything in
\textbf{A}ny \textbf{P}oint cloud), a unified model for interactive 3D
segmentation that supports both point-based and text-based prompts across
diverse domains. Our approach achieves cross-domain generalizability by
training on 7 datasets spanning indoor, outdoor, and aerial environments, while
employing domain-adaptive normalization to prevent negative transfer. For
text-prompted segmentation, we automatically generate mask proposals without
human intervention and match them against CLIP embeddings of textual queries,
enabling both panoptic and open-vocabulary segmentation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SNAP consistently delivers high-quality segmentation results.
We achieve state-of-the-art performance on 8 out of 9 zero-shot benchmarks for
spatial-prompted segmentation and demonstrate competitive results on all 5
text-prompted benchmarks. These results show that a unified model can match or
exceed specialized domain-specific approaches, providing a practical tool for
scalable 3D annotation. Project page is at, https://neu-vi.github.io/SNAP/

*Denis Zavadski,Damjan Kalšan,Tim Küchler,Haebom Lee,Stefan Roth,Carsten Rother*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新框架，利用扩散模型和伪标签将低质量合成数据转化为高质量真实域训练集，显著提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决合成数据与真实数据之间的域适应问题，避免高成本的3D建模。

Method: 使用现成的扩散模型，通过伪标签适应目标域，生成高保真图像，并过滤次优生成。

Result: 在五个合成数据集和两个真实数据集上，分割性能提升高达8.0% mIoU。

Conclusion: 快速构建的合成数据集通过生成模型可达到与高成本数据集相当的效果，为城市场景理解提供高效数据创建方案。

Abstract: Synthetic datasets are widely used for training urban scene recognition
models, but even highly realistic renderings show a noticeable gap to real
imagery. This gap is particularly pronounced when adapting to a specific target
domain, such as Cityscapes, where differences in architecture, vegetation,
object appearance, and camera characteristics limit downstream performance.
Closing this gap with more detailed 3D modelling would require expensive asset
and scene design, defeating the purpose of low-cost labelled data. To address
this, we present a new framework that adapts an off-the-shelf diffusion model
to a target domain using only imperfect pseudo-labels. Once trained, it
generates high-fidelity, target-aligned images from semantic maps of any
synthetic dataset, including low-effort sources created in hours rather than
months. The method filters suboptimal generations, rectifies image-label
misalignments, and standardises semantics across datasets, transforming weak
synthetic data into competitive real-domain training sets. Experiments on five
synthetic datasets and two real target datasets show segmentation gains of up
to +8.0%pt. mIoU over state-of-the-art translation methods, making rapidly
constructed synthetic datasets as effective as high-effort, time-intensive
synthetic datasets requiring extensive manual design. This work highlights a
valuable collaborative paradigm where fast semantic prototyping, combined with
generative models, enables scalable, high-quality training data creation for
urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: 研究为超光谱作物分类提供了系统评估，并指明了未来模型开发方向。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth observation, but their potential for
hyperspectral crop mapping remains underexplored. This study benchmarks three
foundation models for cereal crop mapping using hyperspectral imagery:
HyperSigma, DOFA, and Vision Transformers pre-trained on the SpectralEarth
dataset (a large multitemporal hyperspectral archive). Models were fine-tuned
on manually labeled data from a training region and evaluated on an independent
test region. Performance was measured with overall accuracy (OA), average
accuracy (AA), and F1-score. HyperSigma achieved an OA of 34.5% (+/- 1.8%),
DOFA reached 62.6% (+/- 3.5%), and the SpectralEarth model achieved an OA of
93.5% (+/- 0.8%). A compact SpectralEarth variant trained from scratch achieved
91%, highlighting the importance of model architecture for strong
generalization across geographic regions and sensor platforms. These results
provide a systematic evaluation of foundation models for operational
hyperspectral crop mapping and outline directions for future model development.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MS-Mix是一种自适应、情感敏感的多模态情感分析增强框架，通过情感感知样本选择和动态混合比例优化，解决了传统Mixup在多模态任务中的语义不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析（MSA）受限于标注数据稀缺，传统Mixup方法在多模态场景下容易导致标签模糊和语义不一致。

Method: 提出MS-Mix框架，包含情感感知样本选择（SASS）、情感强度引导（SIG）模块和情感对齐损失（SAL）。

Result: 在三个基准数据集和六种先进骨干网络上，MS-Mix均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MS-Mix为多模态情感分析提供了更鲁棒的增强方法，并建立了新的性能标准。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) aims to identify and interpret human
emotions by integrating information from heterogeneous data sources such as
text, video, and audio. While deep learning models have advanced in network
architecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated
data. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal
tasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random
mixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the
lack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose
MS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that
automatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key
components of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)
strategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples
with contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module
using multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios
dynamically based on their respective emotional intensities. (3) a Sentiment
Alignment Loss (SAL) that aligns the prediction distributions across
modalities, and incorporates the Kullback-Leibler-based loss as an additional
regularization term to train the emotion intensity predictor and the backbone
network jointly. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets with six
state-of-the-art backbones confirm that MS-Mix consistently outperforms
existing methods, establishing a new standard for robust multimodal sentiment
augmentation. The source code is available at:

TL;DR: ACE-G方法通过分离坐标回归器和地图表示，提升了视觉重定位的泛化能力，显著增强了鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统场景坐标回归（SCR）方法在训练视图上过拟合，导致对查询图像的泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出将坐标回归器和地图表示分离为通用变换器和场景特定地图代码，并在大量场景上预训练变换器。

Result: 在多个挑战性数据集上，ACE-G显著提高了鲁棒性，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 分离设计和预训练策略有效解决了SCR的泛化问题，为视觉重定位提供了新思路。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) has established itself as a promising
learning-based approach to visual relocalization. After mere minutes of
scene-specific training, SCR models estimate camera poses of query images with
high accuracy. Still, SCR methods fall short of the generalization capabilities
of more classical feature-matching approaches. When imaging conditions of query
images, such as lighting or viewpoint, are too different from the training
views, SCR models fail. Failing to generalize is an inherent limitation of
previous SCR frameworks, since their training objective is to encode the
training views in the weights of the coordinate regressor itself. The regressor
essentially overfits to the training views, by design. We propose to separate
the coordinate regressor and the map representation into a generic transformer
and a scene-specific map code. This separation allows us to pre-train the
transformer on tens of thousands of scenes. More importantly, it allows us to
train the transformer to generalize from mapping images to unseen query images
during pre-training. We demonstrate on multiple challenging relocalization
datasets that our method, ACE-G, leads to significantly increased robustness
while keeping the computational footprint attractive.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分反映真实实验室工作的细粒度和长期性，尤其是湿实验室环境，因此需要新的评估工具。

Method: 通过从同行评审视频中提取数据，构建了包含三个层次任务（细粒度感知、程序理解、科学推理）的ExpVid基准测试。

Result: 评估了19个领先的MLLMs，发现它们在粗粒度识别上表现良好，但在细粒度细节、状态跟踪和科学推理上表现不佳。

Conclusion: ExpVid为开发可信赖的科学实验伙伴MLLMs提供了诊断工具和路线图。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold promise for accelerating
scientific discovery by interpreting complex experimental procedures. However,
their true capabilities are poorly understood, as existing benchmarks neglect
the fine-grained and long-horizon nature of authentic laboratory work,
especially in wet-lab settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce ExpVid, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate MLLMs on scientific
experiment videos. Curated from peer-reviewed video publications, ExpVid
features a new three-level task hierarchy that mirrors the scientific process:
(1) Fine-grained Perception of tools, materials, and actions; (2) Procedural
Understanding of step order and completeness; and (3) Scientific Reasoning that
connects the full experiment to its published conclusions. Our vision-centric
annotation pipeline, combining automated generation with multi-disciplinary
expert validation, ensures that tasks require visual grounding. We evaluate 19
leading MLLMs on ExpVid and find that while they excel at coarse-grained
recognition, they struggle with disambiguating fine details, tracking state
changes over time, and linking experimental procedures to scientific outcomes.
Our results reveal a notable performance gap between proprietary and
open-source models, particularly in high-order reasoning. ExpVid not only
provides a diagnostic tool but also charts a roadmap for developing MLLMs
capable of becoming trustworthy partners in scientific experimentation.

Motivation: 现有方法要么性能强但无法部署在边缘设备，要么计算高效但性能不足，LLF-LUT++旨在平衡性能与效率。

Method: 采用图像自适应3D LUT和两种权重融合策略进行全局增强，结合空间频率变换器权重预测器和局部拉普拉斯滤波器优化细节。

Result: 在HDR+数据集上PSNR提升2.64 dB，4K图像处理仅需13 ms，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LLF-LUT++在性能和效率上均表现优异，适用于实际应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Photo enhancement plays a crucial role in augmenting the visual aesthetics of
a photograph. In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on
enhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on
edge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate
performance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a
pyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators
through closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This
approach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving
excellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that
capitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while
incorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global
image enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency
transformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct
weights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local
Laplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency
components. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and
transformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on
the HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images
processed in just 13 ms on a single GPU. Extensive experimental results on two
benchmark datasets further show that the proposed approach performs favorably
compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/fengzhang427/LLF-LUT.

Abstract: Combining large language models with evolutionary computation algorithms
represents a promising research direction leveraging the remarkable generative
and in-context learning capabilities of LLMs with the strengths of evolutionary
algorithms. In this work, we present EvoCAD, a method for generating
computer-aided design (CAD) objects through their symbolic representations
using vision language models and evolutionary optimization. Our method samples
multiple CAD objects, which are then optimized using an evolutionary approach
with vision language and reasoning language models. We assess our method using
GPT-4V and GPT-4o, evaluating it on the CADPrompt benchmark dataset and
comparing it to prior methods. Additionally, we introduce two new metrics based
on topological properties defined by the Euler characteristic, which capture a
form of semantic similarity between 3D objects. Our results demonstrate that
EvoCAD outperforms previous approaches on multiple metrics, particularly in
generating topologically correct objects, which can be efficiently evaluated
using our two novel metrics that complement existing spatial metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态方法在特征对齐上存在挑战，而局部特征提取可能过于简化复杂3D检测任务。NV3D旨在通过法向量特征解决这些问题。

Method: NV3D利用KNN和PCA计算体素法向量，提出密度和FOV感知采样策略，并采用元素级注意力融合机制。

Result: 在KITTI验证集上，NV3D在汽车和骑车人检测中分别比基线高2.61%和4.23% mAP，采样后仍保持性能。

Conclusion: NV3D通过法向量特征和高效采样策略，显著提升了3D物体检测性能，同时减少了计算量。

Abstract: Recent studies in 3D object detection for autonomous vehicles aim to enrich
features through the utilization of multi-modal setups or the extraction of
local patterns within LiDAR point clouds. However, multi-modal methods face
significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can
be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we
propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel
neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors
(KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables
NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target
entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector
extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector
density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination
of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied
element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and
value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention
mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated
superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial
shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18%
mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61%
and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in
car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of
voxels being filtered out.

Abstract: Instruction-guided video editing has emerged as a rapidly advancing research
direction, offering new opportunities for intuitive content transformation
while also posing significant challenges for systematic evaluation. Existing
video editing benchmarks fail to support the evaluation of instruction-guided
video editing adequately and further suffer from limited source diversity,
narrow task coverage and incomplete evaluation metrics. To address the above
limitations, we introduce IVEBench, a modern benchmark suite specifically
designed for instruction-guided video editing assessment. IVEBench comprises a
diverse database of 600 high-quality source videos, spanning seven semantic
dimensions, and covering video lengths ranging from 32 to 1,024 frames. It
further includes 8 categories of editing tasks with 35 subcategories, whose
prompts are generated and refined through large language models and expert
review. Crucially, IVEBench establishes a three-dimensional evaluation protocol
encompassing video quality, instruction compliance and video fidelity,
integrating both traditional metrics and multimodal large language model-based
assessments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of IVEBench in
benchmarking state-of-the-art instruction-guided video editing methods, showing
its ability to provide comprehensive and human-aligned evaluation outcomes.

Abstract: Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a
single image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D
scene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,
occlusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,
we introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene
Interaction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent
SMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within
a shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse
monocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,
fuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and
synthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted
optimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly
enforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D
reprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible
regions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only
9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.
It naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse
interactions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing
mean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,
and improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic
foot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of
heavily occluded furniture. By converting a single image into a physically
plausible 3D human-scene pair, PhySIC advances scalable 3D scene understanding.

Abstract: Generating realistic and controllable 3D human avatars is a long-standing
challenge, particularly when covering broad attribute ranges such as ethnicity,
age, clothing styles, and detailed body shapes. Capturing and annotating
large-scale human datasets for training generative models is prohibitively
expensive and limited in scale and diversity. The central question we address
in this paper is: Can existing foundation models be distilled to generate
theoretically unbounded, richly annotated 3D human data? We introduce
InfiniHuman, a framework that synergistically distills these models to produce
richly annotated human data at minimal cost and with theoretically unlimited
scalability. We propose InfiniHumanData, a fully automatic pipeline that
leverages vision-language and image generation models to create a large-scale
multi-modal dataset. User study shows our automatically generated identities
are undistinguishable from scan renderings. InfiniHumanData contains 111K
identities spanning unprecedented diversity. Each identity is annotated with
multi-granularity text descriptions, multi-view RGB images, detailed clothing
images, and SMPL body-shape parameters. Building on this dataset, we propose
InfiniHumanGen, a diffusion-based generative pipeline conditioned on text, body
shape, and clothing assets. InfiniHumanGen enables fast, realistic, and
precisely controllable avatar generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate
significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods in visual quality,
generation speed, and controllability. Our approach enables high-quality avatar
generation with fine-grained control at effectively unbounded scale through a
practical and affordable solution. We will publicly release the automatic data
generation pipeline, the comprehensive InfiniHumanData dataset, and the

Conclusion: FACE通过理论保证和实验验证，提供了更忠实的概念解释。

Abstract: Interpreting deep neural networks through concept-based explanations offers a
bridge between low-level features and high-level human-understandable
semantics. However, existing automatic concept discovery methods often fail to
align these extracted concepts with the model's true decision-making process,
thereby compromising explanation faithfulness. In this work, we propose FACE
(Faithful Automatic Concept Extraction), a novel framework that augments
Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
regularization term to ensure alignment between the model's original and
concept-based predictions. Unlike prior methods that operate solely on encoder
activations, FACE incorporates classifier supervision during concept learning,
enforcing predictive consistency and enabling faithful explanations. We provide
theoretical guarantees showing that minimizing the KL divergence bounds the
deviation in predictive distributions, thereby promoting faithful local
linearity in the learned concept space. Systematic evaluations on ImageNet,
COCO, and CelebA datasets demonstrate that FACE outperforms existing methods
across faithfulness and sparsity metrics.

Result: 在四个基准测试中表现优异，实现实时推理（28 FPS），并在未见过的真实物体上展示强大的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为机器人和具身AI中的开放集6D理解设立了新标准。

Abstract: Estimating an object's 6D pose, size, and shape from visual input is a
fundamental problem in computer vision, with critical applications in robotic
grasping and manipulation. Existing methods either rely on object-specific
priors such as CAD models or templates, or suffer from limited generalization
across categories due to pose-shape entanglement and multi-stage pipelines. In
this work, we propose a unified, category-agnostic framework that
simultaneously predicts 6D pose, size, and dense shape from a single RGB-D
image, without requiring templates, CAD models, or category labels at test
time. Our model fuses dense 2D features from vision foundation models with
partial 3D point clouds using a Transformer encoder enhanced by a
Mixture-of-Experts, and employs parallel decoders for pose-size estimation and
shape reconstruction, achieving real-time inference at 28 FPS. Trained solely
on synthetic data from 149 categories in the SOPE dataset, our framework is
evaluated on four diverse benchmarks SOPE, ROPE, ObjaversePose, and HANDAL,
spanning over 300 categories. It achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on seen
categories while demonstrating remarkably strong zero-shot generalization to
unseen real-world objects, establishing a new standard for open-set 6D
understanding in robotics and embodied AI.

Motivation: 传统DiT依赖的VAE编码器存在架构过时、潜在空间信息容量低和表征质量差等问题，限制了生成效果。

Conclusion: RAE应成为DiT训练的新标准，因其在生成质量和效率上的明显优势。

Abstract: Latent generative modeling, where a pretrained autoencoder maps pixels into a
latent space for the diffusion process, has become the standard strategy for
Diffusion Transformers (DiT); however, the autoencoder component has barely
evolved. Most DiTs continue to rely on the original VAE encoder, which
introduces several limitations: outdated backbones that compromise
architectural simplicity, low-dimensional latent spaces that restrict
information capacity, and weak representations that result from purely
reconstruction-based training and ultimately limit generative quality. In this
work, we explore replacing the VAE with pretrained representation encoders
(e.g., DINO, SigLIP, MAE) paired with trained decoders, forming what we term
Representation Autoencoders (RAEs). These models provide both high-quality
reconstructions and semantically rich latent spaces, while allowing for a
scalable transformer-based architecture. Since these latent spaces are
typically high-dimensional, a key challenge is enabling diffusion transformers
to operate effectively within them. We analyze the sources of this difficulty,
propose theoretically motivated solutions, and validate them empirically. Our
approach achieves faster convergence without auxiliary representation alignment
losses. Using a DiT variant equipped with a lightweight, wide DDT head, we
achieve strong image generation results on ImageNet: 1.51 FID at 256x256 (no
guidance) and 1.13 at both 256x256 and 512x512 (with guidance). RAE offers
clear advantages and should be the new default for diffusion transformer
training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合拓扑学习和贝叶斯采样的新型贝叶斯拓扑CNN，解决了传统CNN数据需求大、预测过度自信和不确定性量化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN需要大量数据训练，预测过度自信且缺乏不确定性量化能力。

Method: 结合拓扑学习和贝叶斯采样，通过先验分布和后验学习加速训练并减少校准误差，引入一致性条件优化先验分布。

Result: 在基准数据集上优于传统CNN、贝叶斯神经网络和拓扑CNN，尤其在数据有限或损坏时表现更优，不确定性量化能力更强。

Conclusion: 新型混合方法在图像分类中展现出更高效和鲁棒的潜力。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been established as the main
workhorse in image data processing; nonetheless, they require large amounts of
data to train, often produce overconfident predictions, and frequently lack the
ability to quantify the uncertainty of their predictions. To address these
concerns, we propose a new Bayesian topological CNN that promotes a novel
interplay between topology-aware learning and Bayesian sampling. Specifically,
it utilizes information from important manifolds to accelerate training while
reducing calibration error by placing prior distributions on network parameters
and properly learning appropriate posteriors. One important contribution of our
work is the inclusion of a consistency condition in the learning cost, which
can effectively modify the prior distributions to improve the performance of
our novel network architecture. We evaluate the model on benchmark image
classification datasets and demonstrate its superiority over conventional CNNs,
Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), and topological CNNs. In particular, we supply
evidence that our method provides an advantage in situations where training
data is limited or corrupted. Furthermore, we show that the new model allows
for better uncertainty quantification than standard BNNs since it can more
readily identify examples of out-of-distribution data on which it has not been
trained. Our results highlight the potential of our novel hybrid approach for
more efficient and robust image classification.

TL;DR: DiT360是一个基于DiT的框架，通过混合训练视角和全景数据生成全景图像，解决了几何保真度和真实感的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏大规模高质量的真实全景数据是生成质量不佳的主要原因，不同于以往专注于模型设计的方法。

Method: DiT360包含跨域转换和域内增强模块，应用于图像和标记级别，结合交叉域知识和混合监督。

Result: 在文本到全景、修复和外扩任务中，DiT360在11个定量指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: DiT360通过数据驱动方法提升了全景图像生成的边界一致性和图像保真度。

Abstract: In this work, we propose DiT360, a DiT-based framework that performs hybrid
training on perspective and panoramic data for panoramic image generation. For
the issues of maintaining geometric fidelity and photorealism in generation
quality, we attribute the main reason to the lack of large-scale, high-quality,
real-world panoramic data, where such a data-centric view differs from prior
methods that focus on model design. Basically, DiT360 has several key modules
for inter-domain transformation and intra-domain augmentation, applied at both
the pre-VAE image level and the post-VAE token level. At the image level, we
incorporate cross-domain knowledge through perspective image guidance and
panoramic refinement, which enhance perceptual quality while regularizing
diversity and photorealism. At the token level, hybrid supervision is applied
across multiple modules, which include circular padding for boundary
continuity, yaw loss for rotational robustness, and cube loss for distortion
awareness. Extensive experiments on text-to-panorama, inpainting, and
outpainting tasks demonstrate that our method achieves better boundary
consistency and image fidelity across eleven quantitative metrics. Our code is

TL;DR: 利用预训练视频扩散模型进行零样本点跟踪，通过视觉标记点随时间移动，性能优于现有零样本方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 追踪器和视频生成器解决相似问题，前者分析运动，后者合成运动。利用这种联系，探索预训练视频扩散模型在零样本点跟踪中的应用。

Method: 在查询点放置独特颜色标记，从中等噪声水平重新生成视频其余部分，传播标记以追踪轨迹。使用未编辑的初始帧作为负提示，确保标记可见。

Result: 实验表明，这种“涌现”轨迹优于现有零样本方法，且在遮挡情况下表现稳定，性能接近专用自监督模型。

Conclusion: 预训练视频扩散模型可用于零样本点跟踪，性能优越且无需专门训练。

Abstract: Trackers and video generators solve closely related problems: the former
analyze motion, while the latter synthesize it. We show that this connection
enables pretrained video diffusion models to perform zero-shot point tracking
by simply prompting them to visually mark points as they move over time. We
place a distinctively colored marker at the query point, then regenerate the
rest of the video from an intermediate noise level. This propagates the marker
across frames, tracing the point's trajectory. To ensure that the marker
remains visible in this counterfactual generation, despite such markers being
unlikely in natural videos, we use the unedited initial frame as a negative
prompt. Through experiments with multiple image-conditioned video diffusion
models, we find that these "emergent" tracks outperform those of prior
zero-shot methods and persist through occlusions, often obtaining performance
that is competitive with specialized self-supervised models.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了Ev4DGS的有效性，并优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: Ev4DGS展示了仅用事件流进行非刚性物体新视角渲染的可行性，并提供了开源模型和数据集。

Abstract: Event cameras offer various advantages for novel view rendering compared to
synchronously operating RGB cameras, and efficient event-based techniques
supporting rigid scenes have been recently demonstrated in the literature. In
the case of non-rigid objects, however, existing approaches additionally
require sparse RGB inputs, which can be a substantial practical limitation; it
remains unknown if similar models could be learned from event streams only.
This paper sheds light on this challenging open question and introduces Ev4DGS,
i.e., the first approach for novel view rendering of non-rigidly deforming
objects in the explicit observation space (i.e., as RGB or greyscale images)
from monocular event streams. Our method regresses a deformable 3D Gaussian
Splatting representation through 1) a loss relating the outputs of the
estimated model with the 2D event observation space, and 2) a coarse 3D
deformation model trained from binary masks generated from events. We perform
experimental comparisons on existing synthetic and newly recorded real datasets
with non-rigid objects. The results demonstrate the validity of Ev4DGS and its
superior performance compared to multiple naive baselines that can be applied
in our setting. We will release our models and the datasets used in the
evaluation for research purposes; see the project webpage:

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models
(VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they
still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance,
such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems.
Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while
multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack
the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we
propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking
with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text
reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into
images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we
first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark
for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples.
Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art
image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures
into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model
for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model
achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully
validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our
work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides
the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and
strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our
datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at
https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.

Motivation: 多任务学习在推荐系统中面临负迁移和任务冲突的挑战，需要更有效的个性化解决方案。

Method: 提出DRGrad框架，包含路由器、更新器和个性化门网络，动态调整任务间的梯度分配。

Result: 在150亿样本的推荐数据集上，DRGrad在AUC指标上优于现有方法，并能处理噪声和任务相关性差异。

Conclusion: DRGrad有效管理多任务冲突，无需增加模型复杂度，适用于不同相关性和个性化程度的任务。

Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) has emerged as a successful strategy in
industrial-scale recommender systems, offering significant advantages such as
capturing diverse users' interests and accurately detecting different behaviors
like ``click" or ``dwell time". However, negative transfer and the seesaw
phenomenon pose challenges to MTL models due to the complex and often
contradictory task correlations in real-world recommendations. To address the
problem while making better use of personalized information, we propose a
personalized Direct Routing Gradient framework (DRGrad), which consists of
three key components: router, updater and personalized gate network. DRGrad
judges the stakes between tasks in the training process, which can leverage all
valid gradients for the respective task to reduce conflicts. We evaluate the
efficiency of DRGrad on complex MTL using a real-world recommendation dataset
with 15 billion samples. The results show that DRGrad's superior performance
over competing state-of-the-art MTL models, especially in terms of AUC (Area
Under the Curve) metrics, indicating that it effectively manages task conflicts
in multi-task learning environments without increasing model complexity, while
also addressing the deficiencies in noise processing. Moreover, experiments on
the public Census-income dataset and Synthetic dataset, have demonstrated the
capability of DRGrad in judging and routing the stakes between tasks with
varying degrees of correlation and personalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速城市化导致交通拥堵和环境压力加剧，传统静态交通管理系统无法满足动态需求，亟需智能化的解决方案。

Method: 采用时空特征融合、频繁序列模式挖掘（FEM）和混合LSTM-Transformer模型，整合多源数据提升预测能力。

Result: 在CityFlowV2数据集上达到98.46%的预测准确率，FEM分析揭示了55%置信度的拥堵模式，系统生成了46个持续拥堵警报。

Conclusion: 结合视频流分析和多源数据的框架能有效提升实时交通管理能力，为智能交通系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization has intensified traffic congestion, environmental strain,
and inefficiencies in transportation systems, creating an urgent need for
intelligent and adaptive traffic management solutions. Conventional systems
relying on static signals and manual monitoring are inadequate for the dynamic
nature of modern traffic. This research aims to develop a unified framework
that integrates CCTV surveillance videos with multi-source data descriptors to
enhance real-time urban traffic prediction. The proposed methodology
incorporates spatio-temporal feature fusion, Frequent Episode Mining for
sequential traffic pattern discovery, and a hybrid LSTM-Transformer model for
robust traffic state forecasting. The framework was evaluated on the CityFlowV2
dataset comprising 313,931 annotated bounding boxes across 46 cameras. It
achieved a high prediction accuracy of 98.46 percent, with a macro precision of
0.9800, macro recall of 0.9839, and macro F1-score of 0.9819. FEM analysis
revealed significant sequential patterns such as moderate-congested transitions
with confidence levels exceeding 55 percent. The 46 sustained congestion alerts
are system-generated, which shows practical value for proactive congestion
management. This emphasizes the need for the incorporation of video stream
analytics with data from multiple sources for the design of real-time,
responsive, adaptable multi-level intelligent transportation systems, which
makes urban mobility smarter and safer.

Result: 通过GPU并行化处理，大幅减少计算时间，且扩散步骤可调以平衡速度与质量。

Conclusion: 深度学习方法在早期研究中具有优势，适合快速探索而非绝对精度要求高的场景。

Abstract: Accurate simulation of wave propagation in complex acoustic materials is
crucial for applications in sound design, noise control, and material
engineering. Traditional numerical solvers, such as finite element methods, are
computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large-scale or
real-time scenarios. In this work, we introduce a dataset of 31,000 acoustic
materials, named HA30K, designed and simulated solving the Helmholtz equations.
For each material, we provide the geometric configuration and the corresponding
pressure field solution, enabling data-driven approaches to learn Helmholtz
equation solutions. As a baseline, we explore a deep learning approach based on
Stable Diffusion with ControlNet, a state-of-the-art model for image
generation. Unlike classical solvers, our approach leverages GPU
parallelization to process multiple simulations simultaneously, drastically
reducing computation time. By representing solutions as images, we bypass the
need for complex simulation software and explicit equation-solving.
Additionally, the number of diffusion steps can be adjusted at inference time,
balancing speed and quality. We aim to demonstrate that deep learning-based
methods are particularly useful in early-stage research, where rapid
exploration is more critical than absolute accuracy.

Motivation: 解决基础模型新版本发布时重复微调的问题，任务向量在不同预训练模型间迁移时参数空间不对齐。

Method: 利用目标模型的梯度符号结构，通过计算少量梯度并掩码源任务向量，实现局部对齐。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中表现显著优于朴素任务向量相加和少样本微调。

Conclusion: GradFix通过梯度符号结构有效迁移知识，理论保证一阶下降，实验验证其优越性。

Abstract: When a new release of a foundation model is published, practitioners
typically need to repeat full fine-tuning, even if the same task has already
been solved in the previous version. A promising alternative is to reuse the
parameter changes (i.e., task vectors) that capture how a model adapts to a
specific task. However, they often fail to transfer across different
pre-trained models due to their misaligned parameter space. In this work, we
show that the key to successful transfer lies in the sign structure of the
gradients of the new model. Based on this insight, we propose GradFix, a novel
method that approximates the ideal gradient sign structure and leverages it to
transfer knowledge using only a handful of labeled samples. Notably, this
requires no additional fine-tuning: the adaptation is achieved by computing a
few gradients at the target model and masking the source task vector
accordingly. This yields an update that is locally aligned with the target loss
landscape, effectively rebasing the task vector onto the new pre-training. We
provide a theoretical guarantee that our method ensures first-order descent.
Empirically, we demonstrate significant performance gains on vision and
language benchmarks, consistently outperforming naive task vector addition and
few-shot fine-tuning.

Motivation: 传统方法使用聚类和CNN处理NOvA实验中的粒子识别任务，但数据以稀疏2D图像形式呈现，需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了一种点集神经网络，通过混合两个视图（XZ和YZ）的信息来处理稀疏矩阵。

Result: 模型内存需求降低90%以上，AUC得分达到96.8%，优于独立处理视图的85.4%。

Conclusion: 点集神经网络在NOvA实验中表现出色，为稀疏数据的高效处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: NOvA is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment that detects neutrino
particles from the NuMI beam at Fermilab. Before data from this experiment can
be used in analyses, raw hits in the detector must be matched to their source
particles, and the type of each particle must be identified. This task has
commonly been done using a mix of traditional clustering approaches and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Due to the construction of the detector,
the data is presented as two sparse 2D images: an XZ and a YZ view of the
detector, rather than a 3D representation. We propose a point set neural
network that operates on the sparse matrices with an operation that mixes
information from both views. Our model uses less than 10% of the memory
required using previous methods while achieving a 96.8% AUC score, a higher
score than obtained when both views are processed independently (85.4%).

Conclusion: 各向异性噪声为DPMs提供了一种简单而有效的归纳偏置调整方法。

Abstract: Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DPMs) have achieved strong generative
performance, yet their inductive biases remain largely implicit. In this work,
we aim to build inductive biases into the training and sampling of diffusion
models to better accommodate the target distribution of the data to model. We
introduce an anisotropic noise operator that shapes these biases by replacing
the isotropic forward covariance with a structured, frequency-diagonal
covariance. This operator unifies band-pass masks and power-law weightings,
allowing us to emphasize or suppress designated frequency bands, while keeping
the forward process Gaussian. We refer to this as spectrally anisotropic
Gaussian diffusion (SAGD). In this work, we derive the score relation for
anisotropic covariances and show that, under full support, the learned score
converges to the true data score as $t\!\to\!0$, while anisotropy reshapes the
probability-flow path from noise to data. Empirically, we show the induced
anisotropy outperforms standard diffusion across several vision datasets, and
enables selective omission: learning while ignoring known corruptions confined
to specific bands. Together, these results demonstrate that carefully designed
anisotropic forward noise provides a simple, yet principled, handle to tailor
inductive bias in DPMs.

Motivation: 传统EIS数据建模使用等效电路模型（ECM），通过非线性最小二乘拟合优化参数，但现有损失函数在收敛速度、计算效率和拟合质量方面存在不足。

Method: 基于EIS的Bode表示，提出了log-B和log-BW两种新损失函数，并在生成的大规模EIS数据集上评估其性能，包括R2分数、卡方值、计算效率和MAPE等指标。

Result: X2损失函数在拟合质量上表现最佳，而log-B在计算效率上更优（快1.4倍），且对大多数电路组件的MAPE更低。

Conclusion: X2损失函数适合以拟合质量为主要目标的场景，而log-B因其高效性和较低的MAPE，成为大规模数据驱动应用（如机器学习模型训练）的强有力替代方案。

Abstract: Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) data is typically modeled using
an equivalent circuit model (ECM), with parameters obtained by minimizing a
loss function via nonlinear least squares fitting. This paper introduces two
new loss functions, log-B and log-BW, derived from the Bode representation of
EIS. Using a large dataset of generated EIS data, the performance of proposed
loss functions was evaluated alongside existing ones in terms of R2 scores,
chi-squared, computational efficiency, and the mean absolute percentage error
(MAPE) between the predicted component values and the original values.
Statistical comparisons revealed that the choice of loss function impacts
convergence, computational efficiency, quality of fit, and MAPE. Our analysis
showed that X2 loss function (squared sum of residuals with proportional
weighting) achieved the highest performance across multiple quality of fit
metrics, making it the preferred choice when the quality of fit is the primary
goal. On the other hand, log-B offered a slightly lower quality of fit while
being approximately 1.4 times faster and producing lower MAPE for most circuit
components, making log-B as a strong alternative. This is a critical factor for
large-scale least squares fitting in data-driven applications, such as training
machine learning models on extensive datasets or iterations.

Conclusion: SODA通过语义凝聚知识蒸馏方案，有效提升了跨模态哈希的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, deep supervised cross-modal hashing methods have achieve compelling
success by learning semantic information in a self-supervised way. However,
they still suffer from the key limitation that the multi-label semantic
extraction process fail to explicitly interact with raw multimodal data, making
the learned representation-level semantic information not compatible with the
heterogeneous multimodal data and hindering the performance of bridging
modality gap. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel
semantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,
dubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a
new textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,
depicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a
cross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal
semantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a
well-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space
can be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of
cross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic
similarities between image and text modality. Extensive experiments on two
benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over the
state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM推理系统独立处理引擎和查询，导致资源效率低下。LMCache旨在通过共享KV缓存解决这一问题。

Method: LMCache提取并存储现代LLM引擎生成的KV缓存，支持缓存卸载和预填充-解码分离，优化数据移动和提供灵活的控制API。

Result: 结合vLLM，LMCache在多样化工作负载中实现了高达15倍的吞吐量提升。

Conclusion: LMCache的高性能和广泛采用为未来KV缓存解决方案提供了宝贵经验。

Abstract: Today's LLM inference systems treat individual engines and queries
independently for simplicity, but this causes significant resource
inefficiencies. While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by
reusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by
disaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be
realized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM
inference engines and queries.
  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV
caching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM
engines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.
LMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming
LLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV
cache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both
cache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode
disaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and
wide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache
data movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement
operations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,
decoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class
control API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for
flexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.
Evaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x
improvement in throughput across diverse workloads. With a growing community,
LMCache has seen dramatic growth in adoption by enterprise inference systems,
which provides valuable lessons for future KV caching solutions. The source

Abstract: Climate change is intensifying wildfire risks globally, making reliable
forecasting critical for adaptation strategies. While machine learning shows
promise for wildfire prediction from Earth observation data, current approaches
lack uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision making. We
present the first systematic analysis of spatial uncertainty in wildfire spread
forecasting using multimodal Earth observation inputs. We demonstrate that
predictive uncertainty exhibits coherent spatial structure concentrated near
fire perimeters. Our novel distance metric reveals high-uncertainty regions
form consistent 20-60 meter buffer zones around predicted firelines - directly
applicable for emergency planning. Feature attribution identifies vegetation
health and fire activity as primary uncertainty drivers. This work enables more
robust wildfire management systems supporting communities adapting to
increasing fire risk under climate change.

Motivation: 药物相互作用是导致不良事件的主要原因，了解药物不相互作用同样重要，以支持更安全的处方和更好的患者结果。

Method: 结合Mol2Vec和SMILES-BERT分子嵌入，以及基于规则的临床评分（RBScore），并使用三阶段元启发式策略（RSmpl-ACO-PSO）优化轻量级神经网络分类器。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现出高预测准确性（ROC-AUC 0.911，PR-AUC 0.867），并在2型糖尿病队列中泛化良好。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建可靠、可解释且计算高效的模型提供了实用途径，支持更安全的药物疗法和临床决策。

Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a leading cause of preventable adverse
events, often complicating treatment and increasing healthcare costs. At the
same time, knowing which drugs do not interact is equally important, as such
knowledge supports safer prescriptions and better patient outcomes. In this
study, we propose an interpretable and efficient framework that blends modern
machine learning with domain knowledge to improve DDI prediction. Our approach
combines two complementary molecular embeddings - Mol2Vec, which captures
fragment-level structural patterns, and SMILES-BERT, which learns contextual
chemical features - together with a leakage-free, rule-based clinical score
(RBScore) that injects pharmacological knowledge without relying on interaction
labels. A lightweight neural classifier is then optimized using a novel
three-stage metaheuristic strategy (RSmpl-ACO-PSO), which balances global
exploration and local refinement for stable performance. Experiments on
real-world datasets demonstrate that the model achieves high predictive
accuracy (ROC-AUC 0.911, PR-AUC 0.867 on DrugBank) and generalizes well to a
clinically relevant Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus cohort. Beyond raw performance,
studies show how embedding fusion, RBScore, and the optimizer each contribute
to precision and robustness. Together, these results highlight a practical
pathway for building reliable, interpretable, and computationally efficient
models that can support safer drug therapies and clinical decision-making.

Result: 在121个数据集中验证了方法的有效性，NF+VAE架构优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为需要精细地理数据的应用提供了新可能，如灾害响应、流行病传播等。

Abstract: It is increasingly important to generate synthetic populations with explicit
coordinates rather than coarse geographic areas, yet no established methods
exist to achieve this. One reason is that latitude and longitude differ from
other continuous variables, exhibiting large empty spaces and highly uneven
densities. To address this, we propose a population synthesis algorithm that
first maps spatial coordinates into a more regular latent space using
Normalizing Flows (NF), and then combines them with other features in a
Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to generate synthetic populations. This approach
also learns the joint distribution between spatial and non-spatial features,
exploiting spatial autocorrelations. We demonstrate the method by generating
synthetic homes with the same statistical properties of real homes in 121
datasets, corresponding to diverse geographies. We further propose an
evaluation framework that measures both spatial accuracy and practical utility,
while ensuring privacy preservation. Our results show that the NF+VAE
architecture outperforms popular benchmarks, including copula-based methods and
uniform allocation within geographic areas. The ability to generate geolocated
synthetic populations at fine spatial resolution opens the door to applications
requiring detailed geography, from household responses to floods, to epidemic
spread, evacuation planning, and transport modeling.

Conclusion: 开发反应材料的AI加速模拟工具时，需考虑领域特异性以提高鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modeling shock-to-detonation phenomena in energetic materials (EMs) requires
capturing complex physical processes such as strong shocks, rapid changes in
microstructural morphology, and nonlinear dynamics of chemical reaction fronts.
These processes participate in energy localization at hotspots, which initiate
chemical energy release leading to detonation. This study addresses the
formation of hotspots in crystalline EMs subjected to weak-to-moderate shock
loading, which, despite its critical relevance to the safe storage and handling
of EMs, remains underexplored compared to the well-studied strong shock
conditions. To overcome the computational challenges associated with direct
numerical simulations, we advance the Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional
Neural Network (PARCv2), which has been shown to be capable of predicting
strong shock responses in EMs. We improved the architecture of PARCv2 to
rapidly predict shear localizations and plastic heating, which play important
roles in the weak-to-moderate shock regime. PARCv2 is benchmarked against two
widely used physics-informed models, namely, Fourier neural operator and neural
ordinary differential equation; we demonstrate its superior performance in
capturing the spatiotemporal dynamics of shear band formation. While all models
exhibit certain failure modes, our findings underscore the importance of
domain-specific considerations in developing robust AI-accelerated simulation
tools for reactive materials.

Conclusion: C-DPS提供了一种无需调参或似然近似的稳定且准确的逆问题解决方案。

Abstract: Inverse problems, where the goal is to recover an unknown signal from noisy
or incomplete measurements, are central to applications in medical imaging,
remote sensing, and computational biology. Diffusion models have recently
emerged as powerful priors for solving such problems. However, existing methods
either rely on projection-based techniques that enforce measurement consistency
through heuristic updates, or they approximate the likelihood $p(\boldsymbol{y}
\mid \boldsymbol{x})$, often resulting in artifacts and instability under
complex or high-noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a
novel framework called \emph{coupled data and measurement space diffusion
posterior sampling} (C-DPS), which eliminates the need for constraint tuning or
likelihood approximation. C-DPS introduces a forward stochastic process in the
measurement space $\{\boldsymbol{y}_t\}$, evolving in parallel with the
data-space diffusion $\{\boldsymbol{x}_t\}$, which enables the derivation of a
closed-form posterior $p(\boldsymbol{x}_{t-1} \mid \boldsymbol{x}_t,
\boldsymbol{y}_{t-1})$. This coupling allows for accurate and recursive
sampling based on a well-defined posterior distribution. Empirical results
demonstrate that C-DPS consistently outperforms existing baselines, both
qualitatively and quantitatively, across multiple inverse problem benchmarks.

Abstract: We propose a simple yet effective use of LLM-powered AI tools to improve
causal estimation. In double machine learning, the accuracy of causal estimates
of the effect of a treatment on an outcome in the presence of a
high-dimensional confounder depends on the performance of estimators of
conditional expectation functions. We show that predictions made by generative
models trained on historical data can be used to improve the performance of
these estimators relative to approaches that solely rely on adjusting for
embeddings extracted from these models. We argue that the historical knowledge
and reasoning capacities associated with these generative models can help
overcome curse-of-dimensionality problems in causal inference problems. We
consider a case study using a small dataset of online jewelry auctions, and
demonstrate that inclusion of LLM-generated guesses as predictors can improve
efficiency in estimation.

Abstract: Deep learning has become a pivotal technology in fields such as computer
vision, scientific computing, and dynamical systems, significantly advancing
these disciplines. However, neural Networks persistently face challenges
related to theoretical understanding, interpretability, and generalization. To
address these issues, researchers are increasingly adopting a differential
equations perspective to propose a unified theoretical framework and systematic
design methodologies for neural networks. In this paper, we provide an
extensive review of deep neural network architectures and dynamic modeling
methods inspired by differential equations. We specifically examine deep neural
network models and deterministic dynamical network constructs based on ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), as well as regularization techniques and
stochastic dynamical network models informed by stochastic differential
equations (SDEs). We present numerical comparisons of these models to
illustrate their characteristics and performance. Finally, we explore promising
research directions in integrating differential equations with deep learning to
offer new insights for developing intelligent computational methods that boast
enhanced interpretability and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: 研究改进了神经网络训练实践，并揭示了关键学习期与热启动之间的联系。

Abstract: This study delves into the plasticity of neural networks, offering empirical
support for the notion that critical learning periods and warm-starting
performance loss can be avoided through simple adjustments to learning
hyperparameters. The critical learning phenomenon emerges when training is
initiated with deficit data. Subsequently, after numerous deficit epochs, the
network's plasticity wanes, impeding its capacity to achieve parity in accuracy
with models trained from scratch, even when extensive clean data training
follows deficit epochs. Building upon seminal research introducing critical
learning periods, we replicate key findings and broaden the experimental scope
of the main experiment from the original work. In addition, we consider a
warm-starting approach and show that it can be seen as a form of deficit
pretraining. In particular, we demonstrate that these problems can be averted
by employing a cyclic learning rate schedule. Our findings not only impact
neural network training practices but also establish a vital link between
critical learning periods and ongoing research on warm-starting neural network
training.

Conclusion: 自适应隐私预算和裁剪是联邦学习中平衡隐私与性能的有效方法。

Abstract: Federated learning is distributed model training across several clients
without disclosing raw data. Despite advancements in data privacy, risks still
remain. Differential Privacy (DP) is a technique to protect sensitive data by
adding noise to model updates, usually controlled by a fixed privacy budget.
However, this approach can introduce excessive noise, particularly when the
model converges, which compromises performance. To address this problem,
adaptive privacy budgets have been investigated as a potential solution. This
work implements DP methods using Laplace and Gaussian mechanisms with an
adaptive privacy budget, extending the SelecEval simulator. We introduce an
adaptive clipping approach in the Gaussian mechanism, ensuring that gradients
of the model are dynamically updated rather than using a fixed sensitivity. We
conduct extensive experiments with various privacy budgets, IID and non-IID
datasets, and different numbers of selected clients per round. While our
experiments were limited to 200 training rounds, the results suggest that
adaptive privacy budgets and adaptive clipping can help maintain model accuracy
while preserving privacy.

Conclusion: 无网格神经求解器是解决复杂PDE的可信工具。未来可扩展时间依赖问题、自适应采样和多状态训练。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) underpin models across science and
engineering, yet analytical solutions are atypical and classical mesh-based
solvers can be costly in high dimensions. This dissertation presents a unified
comparison of three mesh-free neural PDE solvers, physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs), the deep Ritz method (DRM), and weak adversarial networks
(WANs), on Poisson problems (up to 5D) and the time-independent Schr\"odinger
equation in 1D/2D (infinite well and harmonic oscillator), and extends the
study to a laser-driven case of Schr\"odinger's equation via the
Kramers-Henneberger (KH) transformation.
  Under a common protocol, all methods achieve low $L_2$ errors
($10^{-6}$-$10^{-9}$) when paired with forced boundary conditions (FBCs),
forced nodes (FNs), and orthogonality regularization (OG). Across tasks, PINNs
are the most reliable for accuracy and recovery of excited spectra; DRM offers
the best accuracy-runtime trade-off on stationary problems; WAN is more
sensitive but competitive when weak-form constraints and FN/OG are used
effectively. Sensitivity analyses show that FBC removes boundary-loss tuning,
network width matters more than depth for single-network solvers, and most
gains occur within 5000-10,000 epochs. The same toolkit solves the KH case,
indicating transfer beyond canonical benchmarks.
  We provide practical guidelines for method selection and outline the
following extensions: time-dependent formulations for DRM and WAN, adaptive
residual-driven sampling, parallel multi-state training, and neural domain
decomposition. These results support physics-guided neural solvers as credible,
scalable tools for solving complex PDEs.

Motivation: 现有防护措施多为后检测，可能暴露有害内容且精度受限，需实时高效的解决方案。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上表现优异（F1提高15.61%），参数少且延迟低。

Conclusion: Kelp为流式风险检测提供了高效可靠的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Large models (LMs) are powerful content generators, yet their open-ended
nature can also introduce potential risks, such as generating harmful or biased
content. Existing guardrails mostly perform post-hoc detection that may expose
unsafe content before it is caught, and the latency constraints further push
them toward lightweight models, limiting detection accuracy. In this work, we
propose Kelp, a novel plug-in framework that enables streaming risk detection
within the LM generation pipeline. Kelp leverages intermediate LM hidden states
through a Streaming Latent Dynamics Head (SLD), which models the temporal
evolution of risk across the generated sequence for more accurate real-time
risk detection. To ensure reliable streaming moderation in real applications,
we introduce an Anchored Temporal Consistency (ATC) loss to enforce monotonic
harm predictions by embedding a benign-then-harmful temporal prior. Besides,
for a rigorous evaluation of streaming guardrails, we also present
StreamGuardBench-a model-grounded benchmark featuring on-the-fly responses from
each protected model, reflecting real-world streaming scenarios in both text
and vision-language tasks. Across diverse models and datasets, Kelp
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art post-hoc guardrails and prior plug-in
probes (15.61% higher average F1), while using only 20M parameters and adding
less than 0.5 ms of per-token latency.

Conclusion: VCON是一种通用方法，可应用于现有压缩技术，并在多个基准测试中表现出稳定的性能提升。

Abstract: The increasing scale of deep neural networks has led to a growing need for
compression techniques such as pruning, quantization, and low-rank
decomposition. While these methods are very effective in reducing memory,
computation and energy consumption, they often introduce severe accuracy
degradation when applied directly. We introduce Vanishing Contributions (VCON),
a general approach for smoothly transitioning neural models into compressed
form. Rather than replacing the original network directly with its compressed
version, VCON executes the two in parallel during fine-tuning. The contribution
of the original (uncompressed) model is progressively reduced, while that of
the compressed model is gradually increased. This smooth transition allows the
network to adapt over time, improving stability and mitigating accuracy
degradation. We evaluate VCON across computer vision and natural language
processing benchmarks, in combination with multiple compression strategies.
Across all scenarios, VCON leads to consistent improvements: typical gains
exceed 3%, while some configuration exhibits accuracy boosts of 20%. VCON thus
provides a generalizable method that can be applied to the existing compression
techniques, with evidence of consistent gains across multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Time domain simulation, i.e., modeling the system's evolution over time, is a
crucial tool for studying and enhancing power system stability and dynamic
performance. However, these simulations become computationally intractable for
renewable-penetrated grids, due to the small simulation time step required to
capture renewable energy resources' ultra-fast dynamic phenomena in the range
of 1-50 microseconds. This creates a critical need for solutions that are both
fast and scalable, posing a major barrier for the stable integration of
renewable energy resources and thus climate change mitigation. This paper
explores operator learning, a family of machine learning methods that learn
mappings between functions, as a surrogate model for these costly simulations.
The paper investigates, for the first time, the fundamental concept of
simulation time step-invariance, which enables models trained on coarse time
steps to generalize to fine-resolution dynamics. Three operator learning
methods are benchmarked on a simple test system that, while not incorporating
practical complexities of renewable-penetrated grids, serves as a first
proof-of-concept to demonstrate the viability of time step-invariance. Models
are evaluated on (i) zero-shot super-resolution, where training is performed on
a coarse simulation time step and inference is performed at super-resolution,
and (ii) generalization between stable and unstable dynamic regimes. This work
addresses a key challenge in the integration of renewable energy for the
mitigation of climate change by benchmarking operator learning methods to model
physical systems.

Abstract: Static feature exclusion strategies often fail to prevent bias when hidden
dependencies influence the model predictions. To address this issue, we explore
a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates bias mitigation and
automated feature selection within a single learning process. Unlike
traditional heuristic-driven filter or wrapper approaches, our RL agent
adaptively selects features using a reward signal that explicitly integrates
predictive performance with fairness considerations. This dynamic formulation
allows the model to balance generalization, accuracy, and equity throughout the
training process, rather than rely exclusively on pre-processing adjustments or
post hoc correction mechanisms. In this paper, we describe the construction of
a multi-component reward function, the specification of the agents action space
over feature subsets, and the integration of this system with ensemble
learning. We aim to provide a flexible and generalizable way to select features
in environments where predictors are correlated and biases can inadvertently
re-emerge.

Conclusion: 通过心理分类和自适应训练，假新闻检测模型的鲁棒性得到有效提升。

Abstract: The spread of fake news online distorts public judgment and erodes trust in
social media platforms. Although recent fake news detection (FND) models
perform well in standard settings, they remain vulnerable to adversarial
comments-authored by real users or by large language models (LLMs)-that subtly
shift model decisions. In view of this, we first present a comprehensive
evaluation of comment attacks to existing fake news detectors and then
introduce a group-adaptive adversarial training strategy to improve the
robustness of FND models. To be specific, our approach comprises three steps:
(1) dividing adversarial comments into three psychologically grounded
categories: perceptual, cognitive, and societal; (2) generating diverse,
category-specific attacks via LLMs to enhance adversarial training; and (3)
applying a Dirichlet-based adaptive sampling mechanism (InfoDirichlet Adjusting
Mechanism) that dynamically adjusts the learning focus across different comment
categories during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that our
method maintains strong detection accuracy while substantially increasing
robustness to a wide range of adversarial comment perturbations.

Conclusion: PTDI是一种有效的训练数据识别方法，具有严格的统计保证。

Abstract: Identifying training data within large-scale models is critical for copyright
litigation, privacy auditing, and ensuring fair evaluation. The conventional
approaches treat it as a simple binary classification task without statistical
guarantees. A recent approach is designed to control the false discovery rate
(FDR), but its guarantees rely on strong, easily violated assumptions. In this
paper, we introduce Provable Training Data Identification (PTDI), a rigorous
method that identifies a set of training data with strict false discovery rate
(FDR) control. Specifically, our method computes p-values for each data point
using a set of known unseen data, and then constructs a conservative estimator
for the data usage proportion of the test set, which allows us to scale these
p-values. Our approach then selects the final set of training data by
identifying all points whose scaled p-values fall below a data-dependent
threshold. This entire procedure enables the discovery of training data with
provable, strict FDR control and significantly boosted power. Extensive
experiments across a wide range of models (LLMs and VLMs), and datasets
demonstrate that PTDI strictly controls the FDR and achieves higher power.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决设备间需要联合聚类但无法共享本地数据的问题。

Method: 将联邦k-means聚类建模为GTVMin实例，通过添加惩罚项更新局部聚类中心。

Result: 算法仅需共享聚合信息，保护隐私。

Conclusion: 提出的联邦k-means算法在保护隐私的同时实现了联合聚类。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated clustering, where interconnected devices
have access to private local datasets and need to jointly cluster the overall
dataset without sharing their local dataset. Our focus is on hard clustering
based on the k-means principle. We formulate federated k-means clustering as an
instance of GTVMin. This formulation naturally lends to a federated k-means
algorithm where each device updates local cluster centroids by solving a
modified local k-means problem. The modification involves adding a penalty term
to measure the discrepancy between the cluster centroid of neighbouring
devices. Our federated k-means algorithm is privacy-friendly as it only
requires sharing aggregated information among interconnected devices.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于上下文向量的新型路由方法，用于动态选择最适合的LLM模型，无需重新训练即可集成新模型，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有模型路由方法依赖准确模型表示且扩展性受限的问题。

Method: 分两阶段：1) 查询嵌入与投影，对齐路由器的语义空间；2) 基于上下文向量预测模型对新查询的正确性。

Result: 在分布内外任务中均达到最先进的路由性能，且支持无缝集成新模型。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、可扩展，为LLM模型路由提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit complementary strengths. Model
routing harnesses these strengths by dynamically directing each query to the
most suitable model, given a candidate model pool. However, routing performance
relies on accurate model representations, and adding new models typically
requires retraining, limiting scalability. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel routing method using in-context vectors to represent model
capabilities. The method proceeds in two stages. First, queries are embedded
and projected into vectors, with a projector and LLM-based router trained to
reconstruct the original queries, aligning vector representations with the
router's semantic space. Second, each candidate model is profiled on a query
set, and the router learns -- based on in-context vectors of query and model
performance -- to predict whether each model can correctly answer new queries.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
routing performance in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks.
Moreover, our method allows for seamless integration of new models without
retraining the router. The code is available at
https://github.com/lalalamdbf/ICL-Router.

TL;DR: Narrative Learning是一种通过自然语言定义模型并通过解释性提示迭代优化分类标准的方法，实验表明其在多数数据集上优于传统可解释机器学习模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种完全基于自然语言定义模型并通过解释性提示优化分类标准的新方法，以提升模型的可解释性和准确性。

Method: 使用3个合成和3个自然数据集，通过解释性提示迭代优化模型，并与7种基线可解释机器学习模型进行比较。

Result: 在6个数据集中的5个上，Narrative Learning因语言模型的改进在2025年或更早时比基线模型更准确。

Conclusion: Narrative Learning在准确性和可解释性方面具有潜力，尤其是在语言模型不断改进的背景下。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Narrative Learning, a methodology where models
are defined entirely in natural language and iteratively refine their
classification criteria using explanatory prompts rather than traditional
numerical optimisation. We report on experiments to evaluate the accuracy and
potential of this approach using 3 synthetic and 3 natural datasets and compare
them against 7 baseline explainable machine learning models. We demonstrate
that on 5 out of 6 of these datasets, Narrative Learning became more accurate
than the baseline explainable models in 2025 or earlier because of improvements
in language models. We also report on trends in the lexicostatistics of these
models' outputs as a proxy for the comprehensibility of the explanations.

Result: 在适度减少输入的情况下，解释质量基本保持，表明存在成本与质量的权衡。

Conclusion: 研究为资源受限环境下的高效LLM辅助过程分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate textual
explanations of process models discovered from event logs. Producing
explanations from large behavioral abstractions (e.g., directly-follows graphs
or Petri nets) can be computationally expensive. This paper reports an
exploratory evaluation of explanation quality under progressive
behavioral-input reduction, where models are discovered from progressively
smaller prefixes of a fixed log. Our pipeline (i) discovers models at multiple
input sizes, (ii) prompts an LLM to generate explanations, and (iii) uses a
second LLM to assess completeness, bottleneck identification, and suggested
improvements. On synthetic logs, explanation quality is largely preserved under
moderate reduction, indicating a practical cost-quality trade-off. The study is
exploratory, as the scores are LLM-based (comparative signals rather than
ground truth) and the data are synthetic. The results suggest a path toward
more computationally efficient, LLM-assisted process analysis in
resource-constrained settings.

TL;DR: ARROW提出了一种自适应多尺度时间路由方法，用于全球天气预报，解决了现有方法在时空依赖性和误差累积方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动的天气预报方法在建模时空依赖性和长期预测时存在不足，无法平衡误差累积与精细大气变化捕捉。

Method: ARROW构建了多时间间隔预测模型，采用共享-私有专家混合和环形位置编码，并结合强化学习的自适应调度器。

Result: 实验表明ARROW在全球天气预报中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ARROW为全球天气预报领域提供了有前景的新范式。

Abstract: Weather forecasting is a fundamental task in spatiotemporal data analysis,
with broad applications across a wide range of domains. Existing data-driven
forecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short
time interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout
for long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers
from two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and
multi-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)
the rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture
of fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an
Adaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather
Forecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a
multi-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time
intervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures
both shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics
across different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes
the circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial
information. For the second limitation, we develop an adaptive rollout
scheduler based on reinforcement learning, which selects the most suitable time
interval to forecast according to the current weather state. Experimental
results demonstrate that ARROW achieves state-of-the-art performance in global
weather forecasting, establishing a promising paradigm in this field.

Result: 在供应关系识别任务中F-score达0.8543，优于GPT-5等基线，且支持零样本竞争者识别。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂企业网络分析提供强大工具，提升动态市场中的决策和风险管理能力。

Abstract: Identifying inter-firm relationships such as supply and competitive ties is
critical for financial analysis and corporate governance, yet remains
challenging due to the scale, sparsity, and contextual dependence of corporate
data. Graph-based methods capture structure but miss semantic depth, while
large language models (LLMs) excel at text but remain limited in their ability
to represent relational dependencies. To address this, we propose
InterCorpRel-LLM, a cross-modal framework that integrates GNNs with LLMs,
supported by a proprietary dataset derived from FactSet supply chain records
and three tailored training tasks: company graph matching, industry
classification, and supply relation prediction. This design enables effective
joint modeling of structure and semantics. Experiments show that
InterCorpRel-LLM substantially outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-5,
on a supply relation identification task, achieving an F-score of 0.8543 vs.
0.2287 with only a 7B-parameter backbone and lightweight training. The model
also generalizes to zero-shot competitor identification, underscoring its
ability to capture nuanced inter-firm dynamics. Our framework thus provides
analysts and strategists with a robust tool for mapping and reasoning about
complex corporate networks, enhancing decision-making and risk management in
dynamic markets.

Motivation: 验证词汇假说，探索机器学习是否能替代传统心理学理论。

Method: 使用机器学习从形容词列表构建人格模型，并分析百万条Reddit评论。

Result: 大五模型（尤其是宜人性、责任心和神经质）更具描述性和解释力，机器学习模型未能区分特质且缺乏心理测量一致性。

Conclusion: 大五模型稳健，人格语义结构依赖语境；机器学习可验证理论生态效度，但无法替代传统理论。

Abstract: The lexical hypothesis posits that personality traits are encoded in language
and is foundational to models like the Big Five. We created a bottom-up
personality model from a classic adjective list using machine learning and
compared its descriptive utility against the Big Five by analyzing one million
Reddit comments. The Big Five, particularly Agreeableness, Conscientiousness,
and Neuroticism, provided a far more powerful and interpretable description of
these online communities. In contrast, our machine-learning clusters provided
no meaningful distinctions, failed to recover the Extraversion trait, and
lacked the psychometric coherence of the Big Five. These results affirm the
robustness of the Big Five and suggest personality's semantic structure is
context-dependent. Our findings show that while machine learning can help check
the ecological validity of established psychological theories, it may not be
able to replace them.

Method: 提出类均值对齐扰动评分和特征波动评分，结合两者选择样本以保持类间分离并突出模糊区域。

Result: 在ImageNet-100和CIFAR100上表现优于基线，标签效率更高，对噪声和分布变化更鲁棒。

Conclusion: 几何可靠性标准可提升主动学习在真实场景中的可信度。

Abstract: Active Learning (AL) promises to reduce annotation cost by prioritizing
informative samples, yet its reliability is undermined when labels are noisy or
when the data distribution shifts. In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare
categories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,
diversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or
redundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse
Geometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric
regularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method
introduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation
score, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort
inter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures
temporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By
combining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class
separation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or
redundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R
consistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with
fewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger
generalization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that
incorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can
make Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,
a key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines. Our
code is available at https://github.com/Vision-IIITD/NCAL.

Abstract: Patent drafting is complex due to its need for detailed technical

Language Models (LVLMs) show promise across various tasks, their application in
automating patent writing remains underexplored. In this paper, we present
PatentVision, a multimodal framework that integrates textual and visual inputs

Built on advanced LVLMs, PatentVision enhances accuracy by combining fine tuned
vision language models with domain specific training tailored to patents.
Experiments reveal it surpasses text only methods, producing outputs with
greater fidelity and alignment with human written standards. Its incorporation
of visual data allows it to better represent intricate design features and

underscores the value of multimodal techniques in patent automation, providing
a scalable tool to reduce manual workloads and improve consistency.
PatentVision not only advances patent drafting but also lays the groundwork for

Abstract: Modeling multi-modal time-series data is critical for capturing system-level
dynamics, particularly in biosignals where modalities such as ECG, PPG, EDA,
and accelerometry provide complementary perspectives on interconnected
physiological processes. While recent self-supervised learning (SSL) advances
have improved unimodal representation learning, existing multi-modal approaches
often rely on CLIP-style contrastive objectives that overfit to easily aligned
features and misclassify valid cross-modal relationships as negatives,
resulting in fragmented and non-generalizable embeddings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose ProtoMM, a novel SSL framework that introduces a shared
prototype dictionary to anchor heterogeneous modalities in a common embedding
space. By clustering representations around shared prototypes rather than
explicit negative sampling, our method captures complementary information
across modalities and provides a coherent "common language" for physiological
signals. In this work, we focus on developing a Pulse Motion foundation model
with ProtoMM and demonstrate that our approach outperforms contrastive-only and
prior multimodal SSL methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while
offering improved interpretability of learned features.

Abstract: Graph Transformers have recently achieved remarkable progress in graph
representation learning by capturing long-range dependencies through
self-attention. However, their quadratic computational complexity and inability
to effectively model heterogeneous semantics severely limit their scalability
and generalization on real-world heterogeneous graphs. To address these issues,
we propose HeSRN, a novel Heterogeneous Slot-aware Retentive Network for
efficient and expressive heterogeneous graph representation learning. HeSRN
introduces a slot-aware structure encoder that explicitly disentangles
node-type semantics by projecting heterogeneous features into independent slots
and aligning their distributions through slot normalization and retention-based
fusion, effectively mitigating the semantic entanglement caused by forced
feature-space unification in previous Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we
replace the self-attention mechanism with a retention-based encoder, which
models structural and contextual dependencies in linear time complexity while
maintaining strong expressive power. A heterogeneous retentive encoder is
further employed to jointly capture both local structural signals and global
heterogeneous semantics through multi-scale retention layers. Extensive
experiments on four real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate that
HeSRN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art heterogeneous graph neural
networks and Graph Transformer baselines on node classification tasks,
achieving superior accuracy with significantly lower computational complexity.

Abstract: We present an empirical study in the geometric task of learning interatomic
potentials, which shows equivariance matters even more at larger scales; we
show a clear power-law scaling behaviour with respect to data, parameters and
compute with ``architecture-dependent exponents''. In particular, we observe
that equivariant architectures, which leverage task symmetry, scale better than
non-equivariant models. Moreover, among equivariant architectures, higher-order
representations translate to better scaling exponents. Our analysis also
suggests that for compute-optimal training, the data and model sizes should
scale in tandem regardless of the architecture. At a high level, these results
suggest that, contrary to common belief, we should not leave it to the model to
discover fundamental inductive biases such as symmetry, especially as we scale,
because they change the inherent difficulty of the task and its scaling laws.

Abstract: Fingerprinting Radio Frequency (RF) emitters typically involves finding
unique emitter characteristics that are featured in their transmitted signals.
These fingerprints are nuanced but sufficiently detailed, motivating the
pursuit of methods that can successfully extract them. The most granular
downstream task is known as Specific Emitter Identification (SEI), which
requires a well informed RF fingerprinting (RFF) approach for it to be
successful. RFF and SEI have a long history, with numerous application areas in
defence and civilian contexts such as signal intelligence, electronic
surveillance, physical-layer authentication of wireless communication devices,
to name a few. RFF methods also support many other downstream tasks such as
Emitter Data Association (EDA) and RF Emitter Clustering (RFEC) and are
applicable to a range of transmission types. In recent years, data-driven
approaches have become popular in the RFF domain due to their ability to
automatically learn intricate fingerprints from raw data. These methods
generally deliver superior performance when compared to traditional techniques.
The more traditional approaches are often labour-intensive, inflexible and only
applicable to a particular emitter type or transmission scheme. Therefore, we
consider data-driven Machine Learning (ML)-enabled RFF. In particular, we
propose a generic framework for ML-enabled RFF which is inclusive of several
popular downstream tasks such as SEI, EDA and RFEC. Each task is formulated as
a RF fingerprint-dependent task. A variety of use cases using real RF datasets
are presented here to demonstrate the framework for a range of tasks and
application areas, such as spaceborne surveillance, signal intelligence and
countering drones.

Abstract: Time series forecasting (TSF) remains a challenging and largely unsolved
problem in machine learning, despite significant recent efforts leveraging
Large Language Models (LLMs), which predominantly rely on Transformer
architectures. Empirical evidence consistently shows that even powerful
Transformers often fail to outperform much simpler models, e.g., linear models,
on TSF tasks; however, a rigorous theoretical understanding of this phenomenon
remains limited. In this paper, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Transformers' limitations for TSF through the lens of In-Context Learning (ICL)
theory. Specifically, under AR($p$) data, we establish that: (1) Linear
Self-Attention (LSA) models $\textit{cannot}$ achieve lower expected MSE than
classical linear models for in-context forecasting; (2) as the context length
approaches to infinity, LSA asymptotically recovers the optimal linear
predictor; and (3) under Chain-of-Thought (CoT) style inference, predictions
collapse to the mean exponentially. We empirically validate these findings
through carefully designed experiments. Our theory not only sheds light on
several previously underexplored phenomena but also offers practical insights
for designing more effective forecasting architectures. We hope our work
encourages the broader research community to revisit the fundamental
theoretical limitations of TSF and to critically evaluate the direct
application of increasingly sophisticated architectures without deeper
scrutiny.

Abstract: Time series AI is crucial for analyzing dynamic web content, driving a surge
of pre-trained large models known for their strong knowledge encoding and
transfer capabilities across diverse tasks. However, given their
energy-intensive training, inference, and hardware demands, using large models
as a one-fits-all solution raises serious concerns about carbon footprint and
sustainability. For a specific task, a compact yet specialized, high-performing
model may be more practical and affordable, especially for resource-constrained
users such as small businesses. This motivates the question: Can we build
cost-effective lightweight models with large-model-like performance on core
tasks such as forecasting? This paper addresses this question by introducing
SVTime, a novel Small model inspired by large Vision model (LVM) forecasters
for long-term Time series forecasting (LTSF). Recently, LVMs have been shown as
powerful tools for LTSF. We identify a set of key inductive biases of LVM
forecasters -- analogous to the "physics" governing their behaviors in LTSF --
and design small models that encode these biases through meticulously crafted
linear layers and constraint functions. Across 21 baselines spanning
lightweight, complex, and pre-trained large models on 8 benchmark datasets,
SVTime outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models and rivals large
models with 10^3 fewer parameters than LVMs, while enabling efficient training
and inference in low-resource settings.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种预执行安全框架，通过填补数据、模型和评估三个关键缺口，提升LLM代理在多步任务规划中的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防护措施多在执行后介入，难以扩展且缺乏对规划阶段的可控监督，导致高风险行为可能造成严重后果。

Method: 引入AuraGen生成可控数据，提出Safiron作为基础防护模型，并发布Pre-Exec Bench评估基准。

Result: 实验表明Safiron在检测、分类和泛化能力上优于基线模型，提供了更安全的代理系统模板。

Conclusion: 通过填补三大缺口，论文为代理系统的预执行安全提供了实用解决方案，显著降低了潜在风险。

Abstract: While LLM agents can plan multi-step tasks, intervening at the planning
stage-before any action is executed-is often the safest way to prevent harm,
since certain risks can lead to severe consequences once carried out. However,
existing guardrails mostly operate post-execution, which is difficult to scale
and leaves little room for controllable supervision at the plan level. To
address this challenge, we highlight three critical gaps in current research:
data gap, model gap, and evaluation gap. To close the data gap, we introduce
AuraGen, a controllable engine that (i) synthesizes benign trajectories, (ii)
injects category-labeled risks with calibrated difficulty, and (iii) filters
outputs via an automated reward model, producing large and reliable corpora for
pre-execution safety. To close the guardian model gap, we propose a
foundational guardrail Safiron, combining a cross-planner adapter with a
compact guardian model. The adapter unifies different input formats, while
Safiron flags risky cases, assigns risk types, and generates rationales;
trained in two stages with a broadly explored data recipe, Safiron achieves
robust transfer across settings. To close the evaluation gap, we release
Pre-Exec Bench, a realistic benchmark covering diverse tools and branching
trajectories, which measures detection, fine-grained categorization,
explanation, and cross-planner generalization in human-verified scenarios.
Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains of the proposed guardrail
over strong baselines on Pre-Exec Bench, and ablations further distill
actionable practices, providing a practical template for safer agentic systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的新型过采样方法，通过增强多样性来改进不平衡分类问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如SMOTE）在处理分类变量时存在信息损失，而现有LLM方法生成的少数类样本多样性不足。

Method: 结合少数类标签和特征的采样策略，新的排列策略用于微调预训练LLM，并在少数类和插值样本上微调以增加多样性。

Result: 在10个表格数据集上显著优于8个SOTA基线，生成的样本既真实又多样。

Conclusion: 通过熵理论分析证明，该方法有效提升了生成样本的多样性。

Abstract: Oversampling is one of the most widely used approaches for addressing
imbalanced classification. The core idea is to generate additional minority
samples to rebalance the dataset. Most existing methods, such as SMOTE, require
converting categorical variables into numerical vectors, which often leads to
information loss. Recently, large language model (LLM)-based methods have been
introduced to overcome this limitation. However, current LLM-based approaches
typically generate minority samples with limited diversity, reducing robustness
and generalizability in downstream classification tasks. To address this gap,
we propose a novel LLM-based oversampling method designed to enhance diversity.
First, we introduce a sampling strategy that conditions synthetic sample
generation on both minority labels and features. Second, we develop a new
permutation strategy for fine-tuning pre-trained LLMs. Third, we fine-tune the
LLM not only on minority samples but also on interpolated samples to further
enrich variability. Extensive experiments on 10 tabular datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms eight SOTA baselines. The generated
synthetic samples are both realistic and diverse. Moreover, we provide
theoretical analysis through an entropy-based perspective, proving that our
method encourages diversity in the generated samples.

Result: D-SPIB能平衡表示学习和生成目标，并整合不同分子模拟轨迹的温度信息。

Conclusion: D-SPIB在分子任务中表现优异，并能探索训练集外的物理条件。

Abstract: Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional
spaces. In molecular science, where data collection is expensive and important
events are rare, compression to lower-dimensional manifolds is especially
important for various downstream tasks, including generation. We combine a
time-lagged information bottleneck designed to characterize molecular important
representations and a diffusion model in one joint training objective. The
resulting protocol, which we term Diffusive State Predictive Information
Bottleneck (D-SPIB), enables the balancing of representation learning and
generation aims in one flexible architecture. Additionally, the model is
capable of combining temperature information from different molecular
simulation trajectories to learn a coherent and useful internal representation
of thermodynamics. We benchmark D-SPIB on multiple molecular tasks and showcase
its potential for exploring physical conditions outside the training set.

Result: FNOtD显著提升了长期预测稳定性和物理一致性，计算成本远低于传统数值模型。

Conclusion: FNOtD在高频海洋预测中表现优异，兼具高效性和物理准确性。

Abstract: Neural operators are becoming the default tools to learn solutions to
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) in weather and ocean
forecasting applications. Despite early promising achievements, significant
challenges remain, including long-term prediction stability and adherence to
physical laws, particularly for high-frequency processes. In this paper, we
take a step toward addressing these challenges in high-resolution ocean
prediction by incorporating temporal Fourier modes, demonstrating how this
modification enhances physical fidelity. This study compares the standard
Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) with its variant, FNOtD, which has been modified
to internalize the dispersion relation while learning the solution operator for
ocean PDEs. The results demonstrate that entangling space and time in the
training of integral kernels enables the model to capture multiscale wave
propagation and effectively learn ocean dynamics. FNOtD substantially improves
long-term prediction stability and consistency with underlying physical
dynamics in challenging high-frequency settings compared to the standard FNO.
It also provides competitive predictive skill relative to a state-of-the-art
numerical ocean model, while requiring significantly lower computational cost.

Conclusion: 解码性和因果性是表征的互补维度，其差异可揭示隐藏的计算电路。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability seeks to uncover how internal components of
neural networks give rise to predictions. A persistent challenge, however, is
disentangling two often conflated notions: decodability--the recoverability of
information from hidden states--and causality--the extent to which those states
functionally influence outputs. In this work, we investigate their relationship
in vision transformers (ViTs) fine-tuned for object counting. Using activation
patching, we test the causal role of spatial and CLS tokens by transplanting
activations across clean-corrupted image pairs. In parallel, we train linear
probes to assess the decodability of count information at different depths. Our
results reveal systematic mismatches: middle-layer object tokens exert strong
causal influence despite being weakly decodable, whereas final-layer object
tokens support accurate decoding yet are functionally inert. Similarly, the CLS
token becomes decodable in mid-layers but only acquires causal power in the
final layers. These findings highlight that decodability and causality reflect
complementary dimensions of representation--what information is present versus
what is used--and that their divergence can expose hidden computational
circuits.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的提升训练框架，解决了传统梯度下降和反向传播的局限性，如梯度消失/爆炸和非平滑激活问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度神经网络训练方法存在梯度消失/爆炸、非平滑激活和并行化限制等问题，需要替代方案。

Method: 通过将嵌套优化问题转化为高维约束优化问题，利用Bregman距离等凸优化工具，支持分布式优化和非可微激活。

Result: 数值实验表明，提升Bregman方法在标准成像任务中比传统训练更有效稳定，尤其适用于近端激活架构。

Conclusion: 提升训练框架为深度神经网络训练提供了更灵活、高效且稳定的替代方案。

Abstract: The training of deep neural networks predominantly relies on a combination of
gradient-based optimisation and back-propagation for the computation of the
gradient. While incredibly successful, this approach faces challenges such as
vanishing or exploding gradients, difficulties with non-smooth activations, and
an inherently sequential structure that limits parallelisation. Lifted training
methods offer an alternative by reformulating the nested optimisation problem
into a higher-dimensional, constrained optimisation problem where the
constraints are no longer enforced directly but penalised with penalty terms.
This chapter introduces a unified framework that encapsulates various lifted
training strategies, including the Method of Auxiliary Coordinates, Fenchel
Lifted Networks, and Lifted Bregman Training, and demonstrates how diverse
architectures, such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons, Residual Neural Networks, and
Proximal Neural Networks fit within this structure. By leveraging tools from
convex optimisation, particularly Bregman distances, the framework facilitates
distributed optimisation, accommodates non-differentiable proximal activations,
and can improve the conditioning of the training landscape. We discuss the
implementation of these methods using block-coordinate descent strategies,
including deterministic implementations enhanced by accelerated and adaptive
optimisation techniques, as well as implicit stochastic gradient methods.
Furthermore, we explore the application of this framework to inverse problems,
detailing methodologies for both the training of specialised networks (e.g.,
unrolled architectures) and the stable inversion of pre-trained networks.
Numerical results on standard imaging tasks validate the effectiveness and
stability of the lifted Bregman approach compared to conventional training,
particularly for architectures employing proximal activations.

Motivation: 解决连续时间动力系统中近奇异行为的正则化问题，同时保持守恒定律。

Method: 引入平滑单调映射$t \mapsto \tau(t)$，在提升坐标中使轨迹全局平滑。

Result: 该方法可稳定物理信息神经网络和其他AI系统中的潜在流架构。

Conclusion: 该框架将解析正则理论与表示学习方法联系起来，适用于刚性或湍流过程。

Abstract: We present a latent-space formulation of adaptive temporal reparametrization
for continuous-time dynamical systems. The method, called *temporal lifting*,
introduces a smooth monotone mapping $t \mapsto \tau(t)$ that regularizes
near-singular behavior of the underlying flow while preserving its conservation
laws. In the lifted coordinate, trajectories such as those of the
incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on the torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ become
globally smooth. From the standpoint of machine-learning dynamics, temporal
lifting acts as a continuous-time normalization or time-warping operator that
can stabilize physics-informed neural networks and other latent-flow
architectures used in AI systems. The framework links analytic regularity
theory with representation-learning methods for stiff or turbulent processes.

Result: 生成简洁且语义明确的表示，优于线性分解方法和现有对象中心架构。

Conclusion: DecompNet是首个实现全除一残差更新规则的语义自编码器，具有创新性。

Abstract: We propose the Decomposer Networks (DecompNet), a semantic autoencoder that
factorizes an input into multiple interpretable components. Unlike classical
autoencoders that compress an input into a single latent representation, the
Decomposer Network maintains N parallel branches, each assigned a residual
input defined as the original signal minus the reconstructions of all other
branches. By unrolling a Gauss--Seidel style block-coordinate descent into a
differentiable network, DecompNet enforce explicit competition among
components, yielding parsimonious, semantically meaningful representations. We
situate our model relative to linear decomposition methods (PCA, NMF), deep
unrolled optimization, and object-centric architectures (MONet, IODINE, Slot
Attention), and highlight its novelty as the first semantic autoencoder to
implement an all-but-one residual update rule.

Result: 实验表明MuonMax对学习率更鲁棒，Momo变体在超参数调优中表现更优且验证得分更高。

Conclusion: 建议在新任务中使用Momo与MuonMax组合，以减少昂贵的超参数调优成本。

Abstract: To define a steepest descent method over a neural network, we need to choose
a norm for each layer, a way to aggregate these norms across layers, and
whether to use normalization. We systematically explore different alternatives
for aggregating norms across layers, both formalizing existing combinations of
Adam and the recently proposed Muon as a type of non-Euclidean gradient
descent, and deriving new variants of the Muon optimizer. Through a
comprehensive experimental evaluation of the optimizers within our framework,
we find that Muon is sensitive to the choice of learning rate, whereas a new
variant we call MuonMax is significantly more robust. We then show how to
combine any non-Euclidean gradient method with model based momentum (known as
Momo). The new Momo variants of Muon are significantly more robust to
hyperparameter tuning, and often achieve a better validation score. Thus for
new tasks, where the optimal hyperparameters are not known, we advocate for
using Momo in combination with MuonMax to save on costly hyperparameter tuning.

Result: CALM在模拟研究中准确率超过91%，并在真实世界应用中成功识别因果因素。

Conclusion: CALM成功将语言模型的模式识别能力应用于表格数据，推动了准确且可泛化的因果发现。

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is fundamental to scientific fields
like biology, where controlled experiments are often impractical. However,
existing methods, including constraint-based (e.g., PC, causalMGM) and
score-based approaches (e.g., NOTEARS), face significant limitations. These
include an inability to resolve causal direction, restrictions to linear
associations, sensitivity to violations of the faithfulness assumption, and
inefficiency in searching vast hypothesis spaces. While large language models
(LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their application is hindered by
a fundamental discrepancy: they are designed for text, while most causal data
is tabular. To address these challenges, we introduce CALM, a novel causal
analysis language model specifically designed for tabular data in complex
systems. CALM leverages a Mamba-based architecture to classify causal patterns
from pairwise variable relationships. It integrates a comprehensive suite of
evidence, including local causal scores, conditional independence tests, and
relational attributes, to capture a wide spectrum of linear, nonlinear, and
conditional causal mechanisms. Trained on a diverse corpus of synthetic data
(from linear, mixed, and nonlinear models) and 10 real-world biological
datasets with rigorously validated causal relationships, our model ensures
robustness and generalizability. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that CALM
significantly outperforms existing methods in both simulation studies,
achieving over 91% accuracy, and in a real-world application identifying causal
factors in Hepatitis C virus progression. This work represents a significant
step towards accurate and generalizable causal discovery by successfully
adapting the pattern recognition capabilities of language models to the
intricacies of tabular data.

Result: 实验表明ProxRouter在保持内联性能的同时，显著提升了异常查询的路由效果。

Conclusion: ProxRouter是一种高效且鲁棒的路由方案，适用于动态变化的LLM查询场景。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) query routers are critical to modern AI platforms
as they seek to improve efficiency by assigning inference queries to accurate,
yet low-cost models. Parametric routers typically use trained neural networks
for LLM selection but suffer from retraining and maintenance overheads.
Nonparametric routers are training-free, instead estimating LLM accuracy and
cost via similarity between encodings of the input query and training set
queries. However, like their parametric counterparts, nonparametric routers
struggle to generalize to outlier queries, an issue exacerbated by limited
diversity in training sets which are costly to expand and difficult to keep
current with ever-evolving use cases. We propose ProxRouter, which applies an
exponentially tilted aggregation mechanism to balance bias and variance in
nonparametric routers, improving their robustness to outliers. Experiments show
ProxRouter enhances outlier routing while preserving inlier performance with
minimal overhead.

Conclusion: 掌握子任务对网页导航至关重要，WARC-Bench填补了现有基准测试的不足。

Abstract: Training web agents to navigate complex, real-world websites requires them to
master $\textit{subtasks}$ - short-horizon interactions on multiple UI
components (e.g., choosing the correct date in a date picker, or scrolling in a
container to extract information). We introduce WARC-Bench (Web Archive
Benchmark), a novel web navigation benchmark featuring 438 tasks designed to
evaluate multimodal AI agents on subtasks. WARC-Bench enables sandboxed
interactions with dynamic and realistic webpages using Web ARChive files. We
show that WARC-Bench is challenging for leading computer-use models, with the
highest observed success rate being 64.8%. To improve open source models on
subtask, we explore two common training techniques: supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR). Experiments
show that SFT models obtain a 48.8% success rate on the benchmark. Training
with RLVR over SFT checkpoints, even in data-scarce settings, improves the
score to 52.8% on WARC-Bench, outperforming many frontier models. Our analysis
concludes that mastering these subtasks is essential for robust web planning
and navigation, and is a capability not extensively evaluated by existing
benchmarks.

Result: 实验表明，ParBaLS EPIG在固定预算和贝叶斯逻辑回归任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: BDT为主动学习提供了理论支持，ParBaLS EPIG方法在实际应用中具有高效性和优越性能。

Abstract: Over the past couple of decades, many active learning acquisition functions
have been proposed, leaving practitioners with an unclear choice of which to
use. Bayesian Decision Theory (BDT) offers a universal principle to guide
decision-making. In this work, we derive BDT for (Bayesian) active learning in
the myopic framework, where we imagine we only have one more point to label.
This derivation leads to effective algorithms such as Expected Error Reduction
(EER), Expected Predictive Information Gain (EPIG), and other algorithms that
appear in the literature. Furthermore, we show that BAIT (active learning based
on V-optimal experimental design) can be derived from BDT and asymptotic
approximations. A key challenge of such methods is the difficult scaling to
large batch sizes, leading to either computational challenges (BatchBALD) or
dramatic performance drops (top-$B$ selection). Here, using a particular
formulation of the decision process, we derive Partial Batch Label Sampling
(ParBaLS) for the EPIG algorithm. We show experimentally for several datasets
that ParBaLS EPIG gives superior performance for a fixed budget and Bayesian
Logistic Regression on Neural Embeddings. Our code is available at

Conclusion: TAWRMAC通过提供稳定、可泛化和上下文感知的嵌入，推动了连续时间动态图学习的进展。

Abstract: Dynamic graph representation learning has become essential for analyzing
evolving networks in domains such as social network analysis, recommendation
systems, and traffic analysis. However, existing continuous-time methods face
three key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory
without effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting
in embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations
between node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to
fully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence
of rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a
novel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory
Augmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding
stability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves
contextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.
Additionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes
between nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new
connections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures
structural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction
and node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across
three different negative sampling strategies. By providing stable,
generalizable, and context-aware embeddings, TAWRMAC advances the state of the
art in continuous-time dynamic graph learning. The code is available at

Method: 使用Huber回归作为例子，在RKHS中引入概率有效假设空间，建立新的比较定理，将鲁棒风险与预测误差联系起来。

Result: 提出了新的有限样本误差界和收敛速率，适用于无界函数和重尾噪声，并提供了参数调优原则。

Conclusion: 预测误差是分析鲁棒学习的基本视角，研究结果适用于多种鲁棒损失函数，并揭示了鲁棒性与偏差的权衡。

Abstract: We investigate robust nonparametric regression in the presence of
heavy-tailed noise, where the hypothesis class may contain unbounded functions
and robustness is ensured via a robust loss function $\ell_\sigma$. Using Huber
regression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization
in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:
(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment
assumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded
hypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional
generalization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture
out-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be
quantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth
$f^\star$, which is $\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of
robust estimation. To make this workable under unboundedness, we introduce a
\emph{probabilistic effective hypothesis space} that confines the estimator
with high probability and enables a meaningful bias--variance decomposition
under weak $(1+\epsilon)$-moment conditions. Technically, we establish new
comparison theorems linking the excess robust risk to the $L_2$ prediction
error up to a residual of order $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-2\epsilon})$, clarifying
the robustness--bias trade-off induced by the scale parameter $\sigma$.
Building on this, we derive explicit finite-sample error bounds and convergence
rates for Huber regression in RKHS that hold without uniform boundedness and
under heavy-tailed noise. Our study delivers principled tuning rules, extends
beyond Huber to other robust losses, and highlights prediction error, not
excess generalization risk, as the fundamental lens for analyzing robust
learning.

### [279] [Probabilistic bias adjustment of seasonal predictions of Arctic Sea Ice Concentration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09891)
*Parsa Gooya,Reinel Sospedra-Alfonso*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于条件变分自编码器的概率误差校正框架，用于改进北极海冰浓度的季节性预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 北极海冰覆盖的快速减少需要更准确的季节性预测，以减轻负面影响并评估潜在机会。传统方法存在系统性偏差和时空误差，且确定性调整无法量化不确定性。

Method: 使用条件变分自编码器模型，将观测数据的条件分布映射到有偏差的模型预测上，生成大量调整后的预测集合。

Result: 调整后的预测在校准性、观测分布接近度和误差方面优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该方法为北极海冰浓度预测提供了更可靠的误差校正和不确定性量化。

Abstract: Seasonal forecast of Arctic sea ice concentration is key to mitigate the
negative impact and assess potential opportunities posed by the rapid decline
of sea ice coverage. Seasonal prediction systems based on climate models often
show systematic biases and complex spatio-temporal errors that grow with the
forecasts. Consequently, operational predictions are routinely bias corrected
and calibrated using retrospective forecasts. For predictions of Arctic sea ice
concentration, error corrections are mainly based on one-to-one post-processing
methods including climatological mean or linear regression correction and, more
recently, machine learning. Such deterministic adjustments are confined at best
to the limited number of costly-to-run ensemble members of the raw forecast.
However, decision-making requires proper quantification of uncertainty and
likelihood of events, particularly of extremes. We introduce a probabilistic
error correction framework based on a conditional Variational Autoencoder model
to map the conditional distribution of observations given the biased model
prediction. This method naturally allows for generating large ensembles of
adjusted forecasts. We evaluate our model using deterministic and probabilistic
metrics and show that the adjusted forecasts are better calibrated, closer to
the observational distribution, and have smaller errors than climatological
mean adjusted forecasts.

*Yubo Li,Rema Padman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Chain-of-Influence (CoI)的可解释深度学习框架，用于建模临床时间序列数据中的特征间动态依赖关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以捕捉临床变量间的潜在、时变依赖关系，且缺乏可解释性。

Method: CoI采用多级注意力机制：时间注意力层识别关键时间点，跨特征注意力层建模特征间的有向影响。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集和慢性肾病队列中，CoI在预测准确性上显著优于现有方法，并能揭示临床有意义的疾病进展模式。

Conclusion: CoI提供了前所未有的透明性，有助于理解临床决策中的时间和跨特征依赖关系。

Abstract: Modeling clinical time-series data is hampered by the challenge of capturing
latent, time-varying dependencies among features. State-of-the-art approaches
often rely on black-box mechanisms or simple aggregation, failing to explicitly
model how the influence of one clinical variable propagates through others over
time. We propose $\textbf{Chain-of-Influence (CoI)}$, an interpretable deep
learning framework that constructs an explicit, time-unfolded graph of feature
interactions. CoI leverages a multi-level attention architecture: first, a
temporal attention layer identifies critical time points in a patient's record;
second, a cross-feature attention layer models the directed influence from
features at these time points to subsequent features. This design enables the
tracing of influence pathways, providing a granular audit trail that shows how
any feature at any time contributes to the final prediction, both directly and
through its influence on other variables. We evaluate CoI on mortality and
disease progression tasks using the MIMIC-IV dataset and a private chronic
kidney disease cohort. Our framework significantly outperforms existing methods
in predictive accuracy. More importantly, through case studies, we show that
CoI can uncover clinically meaningful, patient-specific patterns of disease
progression that are opaque to other models, offering unprecedented
transparency into the temporal and cross-feature dependencies that inform
clinical decision-making.

*Hung Phan,Son Le Vu,Ali Jannesari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: T2J是一个通过增强提示框架提升LLM在PyTorch到JAX代码翻译性能的方法，显著提高了翻译质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PyTorch和JAX在设计、执行语义和生态成熟度上存在差异，且公开的并行代码库有限，现有评估方法不足以支持跨框架基准测试。

Method: T2J通过收集PyTorch代码、生成初始JAX草案、专业开发者修复并构建增强提示，最终优化LLM翻译性能。

Result: T2J显著提升了GPT-4o-mini的性能，包括CodeBLEU提升10%，修复成本降低50%，生成代码运行速度提升2.5倍。

Conclusion: T2J框架有效解决了PyTorch到JAX翻译的挑战，为跨框架代码翻译提供了新思路。

Abstract: Despite recent progress of large language models (LLMs) on code translation
among mainstream languages, translating PyTorch to JAX remains nontrivial. The
two libraries, though both embedded in Python, differ in core design, execution
semantics, and ecosystem maturity; JAX is newer and comparatively
underrepresented in public code, and parallel PyTorch--JAX corpora are limited.
Weaknesses in existing evaluation further complicate cross-framework
benchmarking. We present T2J, a prompt-augmentation framework that strengthens
LLM-based PyTorch to JAX translation. Our pipeline (i) assembles two PyTorch
sources -- the problem-solving set from TorchLeet (Aroori & Chien, 2025) and a
GitHub-derived set from CodeParrot (Wolf et al., 2022) -- and uses GPT-4o-mini
to produce initial JAX drafts; (ii) engages two professional developers to
iteratively repair those drafts until functional equivalence, yielding a
curated fixed-bug dataset of common errors and patches; and (iii) constructs
augmented prompts that inject structured guidance from these fixes to steer
lightweight LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o-mini). We also introduce three metrics tailored
to PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based
estimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).
Empirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%
on T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%
on T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster
than the baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Layer Normalization在Transformer中的放置通常是经验性的，缺乏理论指导，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过理论分析隐藏状态和梯度的稳定性，推导边界条件，并指导残差步长的缩放。

Result: 理论分析揭示了不同Layer Normalization放置对训练动态的影响，实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 研究为Transformer的稳定性提供了理论框架，可指导未来架构设计。

Abstract: Despite their widespread use, training deep Transformers can be unstable.
Layer normalization, a standard component, improves training stability, but its
placement has often been ad-hoc. In this paper, we conduct a principled study
on the forward (hidden states) and backward (gradient) stability of
Transformers under different layer normalization placements. Our theory
provides key insights into the training dynamics: whether training drives
Transformers toward regular solutions or pathological behaviors. For forward
stability, we derive explicit bounds on the growth of hidden states in trained
Transformers. For backward stability, we analyze how layer normalization
affects the backpropagation of gradients, thereby explaining the training
dynamics of each layer normalization placement. Our analysis also guides the
scaling of residual steps in Transformer blocks, where appropriate choices can
further improve stability and performance. Our numerical results corroborate
our theoretical findings. Beyond these results, our framework provides a
principled way to sanity-check the stability of Transformers under new
architectural modifications, offering guidance for future designs.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative modeling have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in molecular generation, yet the integration of comprehensive
biomedical knowledge into these models has remained an untapped frontier. In
this study, we introduce K-DREAM (Knowledge-Driven Embedding-Augmented Model),
a novel framework that leverages knowledge graphs to augment diffusion-based
generative models for drug discovery. By embedding structured information from
large-scale knowledge graphs, K-DREAM directs molecular generation toward
candidates with higher biological relevance and therapeutic suitability. This
integration ensures that the generated molecules are aligned with specific
therapeutic targets, moving beyond traditional heuristic-driven approaches. In
targeted drug design tasks, K-DREAM generates drug candidates with improved
binding affinities and predicted efficacy, surpassing current state-of-the-art
generative models. It also demonstrates flexibility by producing molecules
designed for multiple targets, enabling applications to complex disease
mechanisms. These results highlight the utility of knowledge-enhanced
generative models in rational drug design and their relevance to practical
therapeutic development.

Abstract: Excess alcohol consumption leads to serious health risks and severe

healthier drinking habits, we introduce a groundbreaking mobile smartwatch
application approach to just-in-time interventions for intoxication warnings.
In this work, we have created a dataset gathering TAC, accelerometer,
gyroscope, and heart rate data from the participants during a period of three

rate smartwatch data collected over an extended monitoring period to classify
intoxication levels. Previous research had used limited smartphone motion data
and conventional machine learning (ML) algorithms to classify heavy drinking
episodes; in this work, we use smartwatch data and perform a thorough
evaluation of different state-of-the-art classifiers such as the Transformer,
Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (bi-LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU),
One-Dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks (1D-CNN), and Hyperdimensional

assessed their efficiency on resource-constrained environments like mobile
hardware. The HDC model achieved the best balance between accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating its practicality for smartwatch-based applications.

Motivation: 解决梯度下降方法中学习率调参困难的问题，尤其是在内循环算法中。

Method: 提出AutoGD，自动决定每轮迭代的学习率增减，无需平滑常数知识。

Result: 实验证明AutoGD在传统问题和变分推断任务中表现优异，且可扩展至AutoBFGS和AutoLBFGS。

Conclusion: AutoGD能自动调整学习率，性能接近最优GD，适用性广泛。

Abstract: The performance of gradient-based optimization methods, such as standard
gradient descent (GD), greatly depends on the choice of learning rate. However,
it can require a non-trivial amount of user tuning effort to select an
appropriate learning rate schedule. When such methods appear as inner loops of
other algorithms, expecting the user to tune the learning rates may be
impractical. To address this, we introduce AutoGD: a gradient descent method
that automatically determines whether to increase or decrease the learning rate
at a given iteration. We establish the convergence of AutoGD, and show that we
can recover the optimal rate of GD (up to a constant) for a broad class of
functions without knowledge of smoothness constants. Experiments on a variety
of traditional problems and variational inference optimization tasks
demonstrate strong performance of the method, along with its extensions to
AutoBFGS and AutoLBFGS.

Motivation: 研究动机在于利用复数网络保留和利用音频信号中的相位信息，以提升处理效果。

Method: 方法包括复数卷积、池化层、Wirtinger微分、复数激活函数，以及训练技术的调整如复数批量归一化和权重初始化。

Result: 实验结果表明，CVCNNs在图像数据集上表现与实数CNN相当，在音频分类任务中略优于实数CNN，且相位信息在GNN建模中带来增益。

Conclusion: 复数架构在音频处理中具有潜力，但未来需进一步优化相位感知设计以充分发挥复数表示的优势。

Abstract: This study explores the design and application of Complex-Valued
Convolutional Neural Networks (CVCNNs) in audio signal processing, with a focus
on preserving and utilizing phase information often neglected in real-valued
networks. We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of
CVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based
differentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are
complemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex
batch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in
training dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.
First, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they
demonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic
complex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first
evaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and
validate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second
experiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform
real CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in
exploiting phase without architectural modifications. Finally, a third
experiment introduces GNNs to model phase information via edge weighting, where
the inclusion of phase yields measurable gains in both binary and multi-class
genre classification. These results underscore the expressive capacity of
complex-valued architectures and confirm phase as a meaningful and exploitable
feature in audio processing applications. While current methods show promise,
especially with activations like cardioid, future advances in phase-aware
design will be essential to leverage the potential of complex representations
in neural networks.

TL;DR: MemPromptTSS是一个用于多粒度时间序列分割的框架，通过引入持久提示记忆，显著提升了分割精度和迭代优化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割方法中提示信号的影响仅限于局部上下文，无法在整个序列中持续发挥作用，限制了分割效果。

Method: 提出MemPromptTSS框架，通过记忆编码器将提示及其周围子序列转换为存储在记忆库中的令牌，实现持久记忆。

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，MemPromptTSS在单次和多次迭代推理中均显著优于基线方法，平均每次迭代增益为2.66个百分点。

Conclusion: 持久记忆对提示引导的分割至关重要，MemPromptTSS是一个实用且高效的框架。

Abstract: Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.

Motivation: 边缘-云端带宽有限，需高效压缩草稿令牌分布以提升推理效率。

Method: 提出SQS-SD框架，结合结构化稀疏化和格基量化；K-SQS采用固定Top-K截断，C-SQS通过在线共形预测自适应调整令牌集。

Result: 实验表明，两种方法在不同操作场景下均能降低延迟和拒绝率。

Conclusion: SQS-SD框架有效解决了带宽限制问题，提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Edge-cloud speculative decoding (SD) accelerates inference by having a
cloud-based large language model (LLM) that verifies draft tokens generated by
a resource-constrained small language model (SLM) at the edge. A central
bottleneck is the limited bandwidth of the edge-cloud link, which necessitates
efficient compression of draft token distributions. We first derive an
information-theoretic bound that decomposes the token rejection rate into
contributions from SLM-LLM distribution mismatch and from quantization
distortion. Guided by this analysis, we propose the Sparse Quantize-and-Sample
SD (SQS-SD) framework, which exploits distributional sparsity through
structured sparsification and lattice-based quantization. Within this
framework, K-SQS applies fixed top-K truncation, while C-SQS adaptively adjusts
the retained token set via online conformal prediction to ensure bounded
deviation from the dense distribution. Empirical results confirm that both
approaches improve end-to-end latency and rejection rates in complimentary
operating regimes.

Conclusion: CRG_IMSC有效解决了传统方法的缺陷，提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Incomplete multi-view spectral clustering generalizes spectral clustering to
multi-view data and simultaneously realizes the partition of multi-view data
with missing views. For this category of method, K-means algorithm needs to be
performed to generate the clustering result after the procedure of feature
extraction. More importantly, the connectivity of samples reflected by the
clustering result is not utilized effectively. To overcome these defects, we
propose Clustering Result re-Guided Incomplete Multi-view Spectral Clustering
(CRG_IMSC). CRG_IMSC obtains the clustering result directly by imposing
nonnegative constraint to the extracted feature. Furthermore, it constructs the
connectivity matrix according to the result of spectral clustering, and
minimizes the residual of self-representation based on the connectivity matrix.
A novel iterative algorithm using multiplicative update is developed to solve
the optimization problem of CRG_IMSC, and its convergence is proved rigorously.
On benchmark datasets, for multi-view data, CRG_IMSC performs better than
state-of-the-art clustering methods, and the experimental results also
demonstrate the convergence of CRG_IMSC algorithm.

Conclusion: 该框架和算法在保证性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: State aggregation aims to reduce the computational complexity of solving
Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) while preserving the performance of the
original system. A fundamental challenge lies in optimizing policies within the
aggregated, or abstract, space such that the performance remains optimal in the
ground MDP-a property referred to as {"}optimal policy equivalence {"}.
  This paper presents an abstraction framework based on the notion of
homomorphism, in which two Markov chains are deemed homomorphic if their value
functions exhibit a linear relationship. Within this theoretical framework, we
establish a sufficient condition for the equivalence of optimal policy.
  We further examine scenarios where the sufficient condition is not met and
derive an upper bound on the approximation error and a performance lower bound
for the objective function under the ground MDP. We propose Homomorphic Policy
Gradient (HPG), which guarantees optimal policy equivalence under sufficient
conditions, and its extension, Error-Bounded HPG (EBHPG), which balances
computational efficiency and the performance loss induced by aggregation. In
the experiments, we validated the theoretical results and conducted comparative
evaluations against seven algorithms.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型性能受限于监督数据的质量和覆盖范围，而传统策略梯度方法在基于流匹配的模型中计算不可行。

Method: FPO通过重新定义重要性采样，结合结构感知信用分配、裁剪替代目标、多步潜在探索和Q-ensemble机制，优化了在线强化学习微调。

Result: 在LIBERO基准和ALOHA模拟任务中，FPO表现优于监督学习、偏好对齐、扩散基线和自回归在线RL基线，并在稀疏奖励下稳定学习。

Conclusion: FPO通过其独特的计算模块和稳定的条件流匹配目标，有效提升了VLA模型的在线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as OpenVLA, Octo, and $\pi_0$ have
shown strong generalization by leveraging large-scale demonstrations, yet their
performance is still fundamentally constrained by the quality and coverage of
supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.

Conclusion: 该方法能有效识别制造过程中的细微异常，适用于在线监测。

Abstract: Online sensing plays an important role in advancing modern manufacturing. The
real-time sensor signals, which can be stored as high-resolution time series
data, contain rich information about the operation status. One of its popular
usages is online process monitoring, which can be achieved by effective anomaly
detection from the sensor signals. However, most existing approaches either
heavily rely on labeled data for training supervised models, or are designed to
detect only extreme outliers, thus are ineffective at identifying subtle
semantic off-track anomalies to capture where new regimes or unexpected
routines start. To address this challenge, we propose an matrix profile-based
unsupervised anomaly detection algorithm that captures fabrication cycle
similarity and performs semantic segmentation to precisely identify the onset
of defect anomalies in additive manufacturing. The effectiveness of the
proposed method is demonstrated by the experiments on real-world sensor data.

Motivation: 现有研究多集中于单一图表示，而联合建模两种图（FCGs和PCGs）尚未充分探索，可能提供更全面的软件系统分析视角。

Method: 构建并训练FCGs和PCGs，提出GeminiNet，采用双图卷积分支和自适应门控机制学习联合嵌入。

Result: 在635个Windows可执行文件（318恶意，317良性）的数据集上，联合嵌入模型优于单一图模型。

Conclusion: GeminiNet通过联合静态和动态视图，实现了更深入的软件系统多视角分析。

Abstract: Software systems can be represented as graphs, capturing dependencies among
functions and processes. An interesting aspect of software systems is that they
can be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction
goals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be
captured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships
between functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned
by the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which
focus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph
representations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the
system, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.
While previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze
software behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph
representation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process
interaction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for
deeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems. This paper presents a
pipeline for constructing and training Function Call Graphs (FCGs) and Process
Call Graphs (PCGs) and learning joint embeddings. We demonstrate that joint
embeddings outperform a single-graph model. In this paper, we propose
GeminiNet, a unified neural network approach that learns joint embeddings from
both FCGs and PCGs. We construct a new dataset of 635 Windows executables (318
malicious and 317 benign), extracting FCGs via Ghidra and PCGs via Any.Run
sandbox. GeminiNet employs dual graph convolutional branches with an adaptive
gating mechanism that balances contributions from static and dynamic views.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Wasserstein分布鲁棒优化（WDRO）方法，通过精确Lipschitz证书和原始方法收紧上界，并设计了灵活的Wasserstein分布攻击（WDA）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WDRO方法基于全局Lipschitz连续性或强对偶性，导致上界松散或计算成本高，需改进。

Method: 采用原始方法和精确Lipschitz证书收紧上界，提出WDA直接构造最坏分布候选。

Result: 方法在鲁棒准确性上具有竞争力，且提供比现有方法更紧的证书。

Conclusion: 新方法在WDRO问题上表现优越，计算高效且灵活性高。

Abstract: Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization (WDRO) provides a framework
for adversarial robustness, yet existing methods based on global Lipschitz
continuity or strong duality often yield loose upper bounds or require
prohibitive computation. In this work, we address these limitations by
introducing a primal approach and adopting a notion of exact Lipschitz
certificate to tighten this upper bound of WDRO. In addition, we propose a
novel Wasserstein distributional attack (WDA) that directly constructs a
candidate for the worst-case distribution. Compared to existing point-wise
attack and its variants, our WDA offers greater flexibility in the number and
location of attack points. In particular, by leveraging the piecewise-affine
structure of ReLU networks on their activation cells, our approach results in
an exact tractable characterization of the corresponding WDRO problem.
Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves competitive robust
accuracy against state-of-the-art baselines while offering tighter certificates
than existing methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BITE是一种双向时间-频率金字塔网络，通过多流协同、金字塔时间-频率注意力和双向自适应卷积，显著提升了EEG识别的跨范式泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG识别模型因数据集特定约束和个体差异导致跨范式泛化能力差，BITE旨在解决这一问题。

Method: BITE整合了对齐的时间-频率流、PTFA多尺度特征增强和BiTCN双向动态建模，实现了端到端的统一架构。

Result: BITE在四个不同范式（BCICIV-2A/2B、HGD、SD-SSVEP）中达到最优性能，且在计算效率上表现优异。

Conclusion: BITE验证了范式对齐的频谱-时间处理对可靠BCI系统的重要性，其统一架构在MI和SSVEP任务中均表现卓越。

Abstract: Existing EEG recognition models suffer from poor cross-paradigm
generalization due to dataset-specific constraints and individual variability.
To overcome these limitations, we propose BITE (Bidirectional Time-Freq Pyramid
Network), an end-to-end unified architecture featuring robust multistream
synergy, pyramid time-frequency attention (PTFA), and bidirectional adaptive
convolutions. The framework uniquely integrates: 1) Aligned time-frequency
streams maintaining temporal synchronization with STFT for bidirectional
modeling, 2) PTFA-based multi-scale feature enhancement amplifying critical
neural patterns, 3) BiTCN with learnable fusion capturing forward/backward
neural dynamics. Demonstrating enhanced robustness, BITE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across four divergent paradigms (BCICIV-2A/2B,
HGD, SD-SSVEP), excelling in both within-subject accuracy and cross-subject
generalization. As a unified architecture, it combines robust performance
across both MI and SSVEP tasks with exceptional computational efficiency. Our
work validates that paradigm-aligned spectral-temporal processing is essential
for reliable BCI systems. Just as its name suggests, BITE "takes a bite out of
EEG." The source code is available at https://github.com/cindy-hong/BiteEEG.

TL;DR: STAT是一种新的微调策略，通过利用更强LLM的元认知能力来提升学生模型在任务中的表现，显著优于传统SFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SFT方法在训练数据与预训练数据相似时表现饱和，需要更有效的微调策略。

Method: STAT通过教师模型识别任务所需技能并标记数据点，根据学生模型的缺失技能动态调整训练集（STAT-Sel）或合成新示例（STAT-Syn）。

Result: 在MATH任务上提升7.5%，在分布外任务上平均提升4.6%，且与GRPO互补。

Conclusion: 技能导向的自适应训练可显著改进当前训练流程。

Abstract: Language models often show little to no improvement (i.e., "saturation") when
trained via vanilla supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on data similar to what they
saw in their training set (e.g., MATH). We introduce a new fine-tuning
strategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition
ability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher
uses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then
labels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By
monitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile
for the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their
responses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two
ways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but
adaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,
the teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across
extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements
of up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,
STAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,
AMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is
complementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved
using STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains. We
conclude that skill-targeted adaptive training should broadly improve current
training pipelines. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 解决无人机在低空经济网络中实时多模态推理时面临的推理精度和通信效率挑战。

Method: 提出系统模型，设计混合整数非凸优化问题，并开发分层优化框架（ARPO算法和LLaRA方法）。

Result: 数值结果表明框架在动态网络条件下显著提升了推理性能和通信效率。

Conclusion: 所提框架有效解决了无人机在低空经济网络中的实时推理和通信优化问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Low-Altitude Economy Networks (LAENets) has enabled
a variety of applications, including aerial surveillance, environmental
sensing, and semantic data collection. To support these scenarios, unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with onboard vision-language models (VLMs)
offer a promising solution for real-time multimodal inference. However,
ensuring both inference accuracy and communication efficiency remains a
significant challenge due to limited onboard resources and dynamic network
conditions. In this paper, we first propose a UAV-enabled LAENet system model
that jointly captures UAV mobility, user-UAV communication, and the onboard
visual question answering (VQA) pipeline. Based on this model, we formulate a
mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem to minimize task latency and
power consumption under user-specific accuracy constraints. To solve the
problem, we design a hierarchical optimization framework composed of two parts:
(i) an Alternating Resolution and Power Optimization (ARPO) algorithm for
resource allocation under accuracy constraints, and (ii) a Large Language
Model-augmented Reinforcement Learning Approach (LLaRA) for adaptive UAV
trajectory optimization. The large language model (LLM) serves as an expert in
refining reward design of reinforcement learning in an offline fashion,
introducing no additional latency in real-time decision-making. Numerical
results demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework in improving
inference performance and communication efficiency under dynamic LAENet
conditions.

TL;DR: PPOPT是一种利用预训练提高小样本训练效率和稳定性的新型无模型深度强化学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习在复杂物理环境中因频繁交互导致的高计算成本问题。

Method: 采用预训练神经网络中间层结合全连接网络的新架构，利用相似物理环境的预训练知识。

Result: PPOPT在小样本训练中优于经典PPO，但弱于基于模型的方法如DYNA DDPG，训练时间更短。

Conclusion: PPOPT通过预训练实现了高效稳定的训练，适用于计算资源有限的环境。

Abstract: We introduce PPOPT - Proximal Policy Optimization using Pretraining, a novel,
model-free deep-reinforcement-learning algorithm that leverages pretraining to
achieve high training efficiency and stability on very small training samples
in physics-based environments. Reinforcement learning agents typically rely on
large samples of environment interactions to learn a policy. However, frequent
interactions with a (computer-simulated) environment may incur high
computational costs, especially when the environment is complex. Our main
innovation is a new policy neural network architecture that consists of a
pretrained neural network middle section sandwiched between two fully-connected
networks. Pretraining part of the network on a different environment with
similar physics will help the agent learn the target environment with high
efficiency because it will leverage a general understanding of the
transferrable physics characteristics from the pretraining environment. We
demonstrate that PPOPT outperforms baseline classic PPO on small training
samples both in terms of rewards gained and general training stability. While
PPOPT underperforms against classic model-based methods such as DYNA DDPG, the
model-free nature of PPOPT allows it to train in significantly less time than
its model-based counterparts. Finally, we present our implementation of PPOPT
as open-source software, available at github.com/Davidrxyang/PPOPT.

Conclusion: FOSSIL是一种通用、高效且可解释的框架，适用于医学影像中的难度感知学习。

Abstract: Deep learning in small and imbalanced biomedical datasets remains
fundamentally constrained by unstable optimization and poor generalization. We
present the first biomedical implementation of FOSSIL (Flexible Optimization
via Sample-Sensitive Importance Learning), a regret-minimizing weighting
framework that adaptively balances training emphasis according to sample
difficulty. Using softmax-based uncertainty as a continuous measure of
difficulty, we construct a four-stage curriculum (Easy-Very Hard) and integrate
FOSSIL into both convolutional and transformer-based architectures for Mpox
skin lesion diagnosis. Across all settings, FOSSIL substantially improves
discrimination (AUC = 0.9573), calibration (ECE = 0.053), and robustness under
real-world perturbations, outperforming conventional baselines without
metadata, manual curation, or synthetic augmentation. The results position
FOSSIL as a generalizable, data-efficient, and interpretable framework for
difficulty-aware learning in medical imaging under data scarcity.

Motivation: 现有学习方法忽略实际稳定性约束且泛化能力不足，需要一种更通用的解决方案。

Method: 采用加权奖励函数和策略漂移方法，结合剪裁策略梯度优化，提升装箱利用率和探索能力。

Result: O4M-SP在多种箱子尺寸下表现优异，显著优于基线方法，并有效处理稳定性约束场景。

Conclusion: O4M-SP是一种高效且实用的三维装箱解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is widely applied in
logistics and warehousing. Existing learning-based approaches often neglect
practical stability-related constraints and exhibit limitations in generalizing
across diverse bin dimensions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
deep reinforcement learning framework, One4Many-StablePacker (O4M-SP). The
primary advantage of O4M-SP is its ability to handle various bin dimensions in
a single training process while incorporating support and weight constraints
common in practice. Our training method introduces two innovative mechanisms.
First, it employs a weighted reward function that integrates loading rate and a
new height difference metric for packing layouts, promoting improved bin
utilization through flatter packing configurations. Second, it combines clipped
policy gradient optimization with a tailored policy drifting method to mitigate
policy entropy collapse, encouraging exploration at critical decision nodes
during packing to avoid suboptimal solutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that O4M-SP generalizes successfully across diverse bin dimensions and
significantly outperforms baseline methods. Furthermore, O4M-SP exhibits strong
practical applicability by effectively addressing packing scenarios with
stability constraints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM是否真正理解人类驾驶逻辑的问题，并提升运动规划的准确性和人类相似性。

Method: 通过结构化驾驶指令和Align2ActChain模块逐步推理，微调LLaMA-2-7B模型。

Result: 在nuPlan测试集上取得高分数（开环85.17，闭环70.31/66.96），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Align2Act通过结构化推理显著提升LLM规划器的性能，适用于真实世界场景。

Abstract: Motion planning in complex scenarios is a core challenge in autonomous
driving. Conventional methods apply predefined rules or learn from driving data
to generate trajectories, while recent approaches leverage large language
models (LLMs) for decision-making. However, it remains unclear whether LLMs
truly capture human driving logic. We propose Align2Act, a motion planning
framework that transforms instruction-tuned LLMs into interpretable planners
aligned with human behavior. We derive structured driving instructions based on
human reasoning patterns (e.g., anticipate hazards, yield at intersections) and
traffic rules (e.g., stop at red lights, maintain lane boundaries). Our
Align2ActChain module guides step-by-step reasoning to produce both an
interpretable rationale and a safe trajectory. By fine-tuning LLaMA-2-7B with
LoRA on one million scenarios from the nuPlan dataset, our method achieves an
open-loop score of 85.17 and closed-loop scores of 70.31 (non-reactive) and
66.96 (reactive) on Test14-random. Unlike prior work focused on synthetic or
open-loop settings, we demonstrate improved planning quality and human-likeness
on the real-world nuPlan closed-loop benchmark. Ablation studies confirm that
structured reasoning significantly improves performance over baseline LLM
planners.

Motivation: 自注意力和卷积各有优缺点，前者自适应但依赖绝对位置编码，后者相对编码但固定核大小限制适应性。

Method: 提出Translution操作，结合两者优势，并设计轻量级α-Translution解决参数过多问题。

Result: 在计算机视觉和自然语言处理任务中，Translution和α-Translution表现优于自注意力。

Conclusion: Translution有效统一了自注意力和卷积的优势，轻量级设计使其更具实用性。

Abstract: When modeling a given type of data, we consider it to involve two key
aspects: 1) identifying relevant elements (e.g., image pixels or textual words)
to a central element, as in a convolutional receptive field, or to a query
element, as in self-attention, and 2) encoding these tokens effectively.
Self-attention can adaptively identify these elements but relies on absolute
positional embedding for structural representation learning. In contrast,
convolution encodes elements in a relative manner, yet their fixed kernel size
limits their ability to adaptively select the relevant elements. In this paper,
we introduce Translution, an operation that unifies the adaptive identification
capability of self-attention and the relative encoding advantage of
convolution. However, this integration leads to a substantial increase in the
number of parameters, exceeding most currently available computational
resources. Therefore, we propose a lightweight variant of Translution, named
{\alpha}-Translution. Experiments on computer vision and natural language
processing tasks show that Translution (including {\alpha}-Translution)
achieves superior accuracy compared to self-attention. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统持续预训练方法存在灾难性遗忘和领域容量有限的问题，需要更高效的参数扩展和优化策略。

Method: ADEPT通过选择性层扩展和自适应单元解耦调优，平衡知识注入和保留。

Result: 在数学和医学基准测试中，ADEPT优于全参数CPT，仅需15%的参数和不到50%的训练时间。

Conclusion: ADEPT证明了针对性扩展和解耦优化的必要性，为高效领域适应提供了新原则。

Abstract: Conventional continual pretraining (CPT) for large language model (LLM)
domain adaptation often suffers from catastrophic forgetting and limited domain
capacity. Existing strategies adopt layer expansion, introducing additional
trainable parameters to accommodate new knowledge. However, the uniform
expansion and updates still entangle general and domain learning, undermining
its effectiveness. Our pilot studies reveal that LLMs exhibit functional
specialization, where layers and units differentially encode general-critical
capabilities, suggesting that parameter expansion and optimization should be
function-aware. We then propose ADEPT, Adaptive Expansion and Dynamic Decoupled
Tuning for continual pretraining, a two-stage framework for domain-adaptive
CPT. ADEPT first performs General-Competence Guided Selective Layer Expansion,
duplicating layers least critical for the general domain to increase
representational capacity while minimizing interference with general knowledge.
It then applies Adaptive Unit-Wise Decoupled Tuning, disentangling parameter
units within expanded layers according to their general-domain importance and
assigning asymmetric learning rates to balance knowledge injection and
retention. Experiments on mathematical and medical benchmarks show that ADEPT
outperforms full-parameter CPT by up to 5.76% on the general domain and 5.58%
on the target domain with only 15% of parameters tuned and less than 50%
training time. Ablation studies, theoretical analysis, and extended
investigations further demonstrate the necessity of targeted expansion and
decoupled optimization, providing new principles for efficient and robust
domain-adaptive CPT. Our code is open-sourced at

Abstract: Deep learning models have attracted lots of research attention in time series
classification (TSC) task in the past two decades. Recently, deep neural
networks (DNN) have surpassed classical distance-based methods and achieved
state-of-the-art performance. Despite their promising performance, deep neural
networks (DNNs) have been shown to rely on spurious correlations present in the
training data, which can hinder generalization. For instance, a model might
incorrectly associate the presence of grass with the label ``cat" if the
training set have majority of cats lying in grassy backgrounds. However, the
shortcut behavior of DNNs in time series remain under-explored. Most existing
shortcut work are relying on external attributes such as gender, patients
group, instead of focus on the internal bias behavior in time series models.
  In this paper, we take the first step to investigate and establish
point-based shortcut learning behavior in deep learning time series
classification. We further propose a simple detection method based on other
class to detect shortcut occurs without relying on test data or clean training
classes. We test our proposed method in UCR time series datasets.

Conclusion: 上下文感知的MBRL算法（如cMask）在自动驾驶任务中具有更强的泛化能力和性能优势。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.

Motivation: 探索Looped-Attn优于Single-Attn的理论基础，从损失景观几何学角度解释其优势。

Method: 扩展River-Valley景观模型，区分U形和V形谷，提出Looped-Attn的景观级归纳偏置。基于此提出SHIFT训练框架。

Result: 理论推导表明Looped-Attn的V形谷景观能更好收敛并学习复杂模式，SHIFT框架加速训练且性能相当。

Conclusion: Looped-Attn的景观级归纳偏置是其优势的关键，SHIFT框架为高效训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: While looped transformers (termed as Looped-Attn) often outperform standard
transformers (termed as Single-Attn) on complex reasoning tasks, the
theoretical basis for this advantage remains underexplored. In this paper, we
explain this phenomenon through the lens of loss landscape geometry, inspired
by empirical observations of their distinct dynamics at both sample and Hessian
levels. To formalize this, we extend the River-Valley landscape model by
distinguishing between U-shaped valleys (flat) and V-shaped valleys (steep).
Based on empirical observations, we conjecture that the recursive architecture
of Looped-Attn induces a landscape-level inductive bias towards River-V-Valley.
Theoretical derivations based on this inductive bias guarantee a better loss
convergence along the river due to valley hopping, and further encourage
learning about complex patterns compared to the River-U-Valley induced by
Single-Attn. Building on this insight, we propose SHIFT (Staged HIerarchical
Framework for Progressive Training), a staged training framework that
accelerates the training process of Looped-Attn while achieving comparable
performances.

Motivation: 理解GNNs表达力与泛化能力之间的内在关系，为设计更优的GNN架构提供理论基础。

Method: 通过Weisfeiler-Leman（WL）着色算法，将GNNs的表达力与Rademacher复杂性（泛化能力的关键指标）联系起来。

Result: 证明表达力越强的GNNs具有更高的Rademacher复杂性，泛化能力更弱；同时复杂性对采样扰动具有稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究统一了GNNs表达力与泛化能力的分析框架，解释了表达力提升常以泛化能力下降为代价的原因。

Abstract: The expressive power of graph neural networks (GNNs) is typically understood
through their correspondence with graph isomorphism tests such as the
Weisfeiler-Leman (WL) hierarchy. While more expressive GNNs can distinguish a
richer set of graphs, they are also observed to suffer from higher
generalization error. This work provides a theoretical explanation for this
trade-off by linking expressivity and generalization through the lens of
coloring algorithms. Specifically, we show that the number of equivalence
classes induced by WL colorings directly bounds the GNNs Rademacher complexity
-- a key data-dependent measure of generalization. Our analysis reveals that
greater expressivity leads to higher complexity and thus weaker generalization
guarantees. Furthermore, we prove that the Rademacher complexity is stable
under perturbations in the color counts across different samples, ensuring
robustness to sampling variability across datasets. Importantly, our framework
is not restricted to message-passing GNNs or 1-WL, but extends to arbitrary GNN
architectures and expressivity measures that partition graphs into equivalence
classes. These results unify the study of expressivity and generalization in
GNNs, providing a principled understanding of why increasing expressive power
often comes at the cost of generalization.

*Guilin Li,Yun Zhang,Xiuyuan Chen,Chengqi Li,Bo Wang,Linghe Kong,Wenjia Wang,Weiran Huang,Matthias Hwai Yong Tan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PANTHER是一个结合生成与判别模型的框架，用于用户行为建模，通过预训练和实时推理提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型（LLMs）在用户行为建模方面表现不足，需要一种能处理高维行为序列的方法。

Method: 提出PANTHER框架，包括结构化标记化、序列模式识别模块、统一用户画像嵌入和实时扩展性。

Result: 在微信支付中部署，PANTHER在下一交易预测和欺诈检测中分别提升25.6%和38.6%。

Conclusion: PANTHER是一个可扩展的高性能框架，适用于工业级用户行为建模。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown that generative pretraining can
distill vast world knowledge into compact token representations. While LLMs
encapsulate extensive world knowledge, they remain limited in modeling the
behavioral knowledge contained within user interaction histories. User behavior
forms a distinct modality, where each action, defined by multi-dimensional
attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this
gap, we extend generative pretraining to user behavior, learning transferable
representations from unlabeled behavioral data analogous to how LLMs learn from
text. We present PANTHER, a hybrid generative-discriminative framework that
unifies user behavior pretraining and downstream adaptation, enabling
large-scale sequential user representation learning and real-time inference.
PANTHER introduces: (1) Structured Tokenization to compress multi-dimensional
transaction attributes into an interpretable vocabulary; (2) Sequence Pattern
Recognition Module (SPRM) for modeling periodic transaction motifs; (3) a
Unified User-Profile Embedding that fuses static demographics with dynamic
transaction histories; and (4) Real-time scalability enabled by offline caching
of pretrained embeddings for millisecond-level inference. Fully deployed and
operational online at WeChat Pay, PANTHER delivers a 25.6 percent boost in
next-transaction prediction HitRate@1 and a 38.6 percent relative improvement
in fraud detection recall over baselines. Cross-domain evaluations on public
benchmarks show strong generalization, achieving up to 21 percent HitRate@1
gains over transformer baselines, establishing PANTHER as a scalable,
high-performance framework for industrial sequential user behavior modeling.

*Yanping Zheng,Zhewei Wei,Frank de Hoog,Xu Chen,Hongteng Xu,Yuhang Ye,Jiadeng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Lighter-X是一个高效模块化框架，显著降低GNN推荐系统的参数和计算复杂度，同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN推荐系统（如LightGCN）参数复杂度高，难以在大规模图上部署。

Method: 分析参数冗余，提出稀疏邻接结构和高维嵌入矩阵的压缩方案，参数复杂度降至O(h×d)。

Result: 实验表明，Lighter-X在参数大幅减少的情况下性能与基线相当，甚至在大规模图上表现更好。

Conclusion: Lighter-X解决了GNN推荐系统的可扩展性问题，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in
recommendation systems. However, conventional graph-based recommenders, such as
LightGCN, require maintaining embeddings of size $d$ for each node, resulting
in a parameter complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \times d)$, where $n$ represents
the total number of users and items. This scaling pattern poses significant
challenges for deployment on large-scale graphs encountered in real-world
applications. To address this scalability limitation, we propose
\textbf{Lighter-X}, an efficient and modular framework that can be seamlessly
integrated with existing GNN-based recommender architectures. Our approach
substantially reduces both parameter size and computational complexity while
preserving the theoretical guarantees and empirical performance of the base
models, thereby enabling practical deployment at scale. Specifically, we
analyze the original structure and inherent redundancy in their parameters,
identifying opportunities for optimization. Based on this insight, we propose
an efficient compression scheme for the sparse adjacency structure and
high-dimensional embedding matrices, achieving a parameter complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(h \times d)$, where $h \ll n$. Furthermore, the model is optimized
through a decoupled framework, reducing computational complexity during the
training process and enhancing scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that Lighter-X achieves comparable performance to baseline models with
significantly fewer parameters. In particular, on large-scale interaction
graphs with millions of edges, we are able to attain even better results with
only 1\% of the parameter over LightGCN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种偏好驱动的知识蒸馏框架（PKD），结合LLMs和GNNs的优势，用于少样本节点分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GNNs依赖人工标注和LLMs扩展性差的问题，同时应对TAGs中节点局部拓扑的复杂性。

Method: 开发了GNN偏好驱动的节点选择器和节点偏好驱动的GNN选择器，实现从LLMs到教师GNNs再到学生GNN的知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验验证了PKD框架在真实TAGs上少样本节点分类的有效性。

Conclusion: PKD框架成功结合了LLMs和GNNs的优势，提升了少样本节点分类的性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) can efficiently process text-attributed graphs
(TAGs) due to their message-passing mechanisms, but their training heavily
relies on the human-annotated labels. Moreover, the complex and diverse local
topologies of nodes of real-world TAGs make it challenging for a single
mechanism to handle. Large language models (LLMs) perform well in
zero-/few-shot learning on TAGs but suffer from a scalability challenge.
Therefore, we propose a preference-driven knowledge distillation (PKD)
framework to synergize the complementary strengths of LLMs and various GNNs for
few-shot node classification. Specifically, we develop a GNN-preference-driven
node selector that effectively promotes prediction distillation from LLMs to
teacher GNNs. To further tackle nodes' intricate local topologies, we develop a
node-preference-driven GNN selector that identifies the most suitable teacher
GNN for each node, thereby facilitating tailored knowledge distillation from
teacher GNNs to the student GNN. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our proposed framework in few-shot node classification on real-world TAGs.

TL;DR: CacheClip是一种新框架，通过小辅助LLM识别关键令牌，优化KV缓存重用，显著提升RAG系统的TTFT和生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RAG系统中因长输入序列导致的TTFT瓶颈问题，现有方法在缓存重用和质量之间存在权衡。

Method: 结合辅助模型引导的令牌选择、共享前缀和分组策略，优化KV缓存重用。

Result: 在NIAH和LongBench上保持94.8%和85.0%的全注意力性能，推理速度提升1.92倍。

Conclusion: CacheClip有效平衡了RAG系统的效率和质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.
Experiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention
performance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%
and 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%). Meanwhile, CacheClip accelerates LLM
inference by up to 1.92x in prefill time, providing a practical solution to the
efficiency-quality trade-off in RAG systems.

TL;DR: PermLLM是一种新颖的后训练剪枝框架，通过可学习的通道置换（LCP）优化N:M稀疏模型，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统通道置换方法依赖手工设计的质量指标，难以准确捕捉剪枝对模型性能的影响。

Method: 提出LCP，利用Sinkhorn归一化将离散置换矩阵转化为可微的软置换矩阵，支持端到端优化；并采用高效的块级通道置换策略。

Result: 在LLaMA、Qwen和OPT模型上的实验表明，PermLLM在优化N:M稀疏模型方面表现优异。

Conclusion: PermLLM通过自适应优化通道置换，有效减少剪枝误差，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Channel permutation is a powerful technique for enhancing the accuracy of N:M
sparse models by reordering the channels of weight matrices to prioritize the
retention of important weights. However, traditional channel permutation
methods rely on handcrafted quality metrics, which often fail to accurately
capture the true impact of pruning on model performance. To address this
limitation, we propose PermLLM, a novel post-training pruning framework that
introduces learnable channel permutation (LCP) for N:M sparsity. LCP leverages
Sinkhorn normalization to transform discrete permutation matrices into
differentiable soft permutation matrices, enabling end-to-end optimization.
Additionally, PermLLM incorporates an efficient block-wise channel permutation
strategy, which significantly reduces the number of learnable parameters and
computational complexity. PermLLM seamlessly integrates with existing one-shot
pruning methods to adaptively optimize channel permutations, effectively
mitigating pruning-induced errors. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA series,
Qwen, and OPT models demonstrate that PermLLM achieves superior performance in
optimizing N:M sparse models. The code is available at

Conclusion: Cyc-Attack解决了对抗攻击中的梯度不可行、类别不平衡和物理一致性挑战，为天气预报模型的安全性提供了新视角。

Abstract: Deep learning based weather forecasting (DLWF) models leverage past weather
observations to generate future forecasts, supporting a wide range of
downstream tasks, including tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory prediction. In
this paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where
subtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream
TC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF
models has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that
reliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains
a challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,
non-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks
infeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class
imbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that
will produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining
physical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another
significant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a
novel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate
adversarial trajectories. First, we pre-train a differentiable surrogate model
to approximate the TC detector's output, enabling the construction of
gradient-based attacks. Cyc-Attack also employs skewness-aware loss function
with kernel dilation strategy to address the imbalance problem. Finally, a
distance-based gradient weighting scheme and regularization are used to
constrain the perturbations and eliminate spurious trajectories to ensure the
adversarial forecasts are realistic and not easily detectable.

Conclusion: FIRE通过频域分解提供数学抽象，解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了可解释且鲁棒的预测。

Abstract: Current approaches for time series forecasting, whether in the time or
frequency domain, predominantly use deep learning models based on linear layers
or transformers. They often encode time series data in a black-box manner and
rely on trial-and-error optimization solely based on forecasting performance,
leading to limited interpretability and theoretical understanding. Furthermore,
the dynamics in data distribution over time and frequency domains pose a
critical challenge to accurate forecasting. We propose FIRE, a unified
frequency domain decomposition framework that provides a mathematical
abstraction for diverse types of time series, so as to achieve interpretable
and robust time series forecasting. FIRE introduces several key innovations:
(i) independent modeling of amplitude and phase components, (ii) adaptive
learning of weights of frequency basis components, (iii) a targeted loss
function, and (iv) a novel training paradigm for sparse data. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that FIRE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
models on long-term forecasting benchmarks, achieving superior predictive
performance and significantly enhancing interpretability of time series

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have the generative controllability by
incorporating external conditions. However, their performance significantly
degrades with noisy conditions, such as corrupted labels in the image
generation or unreliable observations or states in the control policy
generation. This paper introduces a robust learning framework to address
extremely noisy conditions in conditional diffusion models. We empirically
demonstrate that existing noise-robust methods fail when the noise level is
high. To overcome this, we propose learning pseudo conditions as surrogates for
clean conditions and refining pseudo ones progressively via the technique of
temporal ensembling. Additionally, we develop a Reverse-time Diffusion
Condition (RDC) technique, which diffuses pseudo conditions to reinforce the
memorization effect and further facilitate the refinement of the pseudo
conditions. Experimentally, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
across a range of noise levels on both class-conditional image generation and
visuomotor policy generation tasks.The code can be accessible via the project

Conclusion: STEER通过直接控制熵动态，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) can enhance LLM
reasoning, its training process poses a critical risk: entropy collapse. This
phenomenon is a rapid loss of policy diversity, stemming from the
exploration-exploitation imbalance and leading to a lack of generalization.
Recent entropy-intervention methods aim to prevent \coloredtext{entropy
collapse}, yet their underlying mechanisms remain unclear. In this paper, we
conduct a quantitative analysis to reveal token-level entropy changes and how
existing entropy intervention methods help avoid entropy collapse. Our findings
point out a fundamental limitation of existing methods: they attempt to control
entropy dynamics indirectly. By only affecting related factors, such as the
advantage signal and generation probability, their effectiveness is inherently
limited and could potentially fail. To address this limitation, we introduce an
entropy-change-aware reweighting scheme, namely Stabilizing Token-level
Entropy-changE via Reweighting (STEER), that adaptively stabilizes entropy
dynamics through fine-grained token-level adjustments. Our approach mitigates
over-exploitation while fostering robust exploration. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that STEER significantly mitigates entropy collapse, stabilizes
entropy dynamics, and achieves stronger downstream performance across various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks \footnote{Our code is available at

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，CauchyNet的预测准确性优于现有模型，平均绝对误差降低50%，且参数更少。

Conclusion: CauchyNet是一种高效且有效的预测建模工具，特别适用于资源受限和数据稀缺的环境。

Abstract: A novel neural network inspired by Cauchy's integral formula, is proposed for
function approximation tasks that include time series forecasting, missing data
imputation, etc. Hence, the novel neural network is named CauchyNet. By
embedding real-valued data into the complex plane, CauchyNet efficiently
captures complex temporal dependencies, surpassing traditional real-valued
models in both predictive performance and computational efficiency. Grounded in
Cauchy's integral formula and supported by the universal approximation theorem,
CauchyNet offers strong theoretical guarantees for function approximation. The
architecture incorporates complex-valued activation functions, enabling robust
learning from incomplete data while maintaining a compact parameter footprint
and reducing computational overhead. Through extensive experiments in diverse
domains, including transportation, energy consumption, and epidemiological
data, CauchyNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive
accuracy, often achieving a 50% lower mean absolute error with fewer
parameters. These findings highlight CauchyNet's potential as an effective and
efficient tool for data-driven predictive modeling, particularly in

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as
a promising framework for improving reasoning abilities in Large Language
Models (LLMs). However, policy optimized with binary verification prone to
overlook potential valuable exploration in reasoning trajectory. In view of
heavy annotation cost of golden Process Reward Models (PRMs), recent works
attempt using auxiliary signals for reward shaping of process tokens, involving
entropy and likelihood collected from logit space. In this work, we offer a
novel perspective on shaping RLVR with flow rewards derived from latent space,
and propose RLFR, where the flow fields of model latents are constructed from
either off-policy high-quality data and on-policy rejection sampling data, and
the velocity deviations of policy latents within it are quantified to serve as
a reward signal. RLFR first demonstrates that a well-established flow field can
be a sound environment for reward signal collection, highlighting the
expressive latent space is much underexplored. Moreover, RLFR is able to
compress any off-policy expert data as reference for constituting reward
signals, and we show that the efficient context dependence compressed within
the hidden states are utilized, rather than individual token-level denotation
for context comprehending. Experiments on both language and multimodal
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the reliability of flow rewards, and
suggesting a promising paradigm for reward shaping with auxiliary signals.

Conclusion: GraphBFN通过统一分类与回归目标，显著提升了分子图生成的性能与多样性。

Abstract: Molecular graph generation is essentially a classification generation
problem, aimed at predicting categories of atoms and bonds. Currently,
prevailing paradigms such as continuous diffusion models are trained to predict
continuous numerical values, treating the training process as a regression
task. However, the final generation necessitates a rounding step to convert
these predictions back into discrete classification categories, which is
intrinsically a classification operation. Given that the rounding operation is
not incorporated during training, there exists a significant discrepancy
between the model's training objective and its inference procedure. As a
consequence, an excessive emphasis on point-wise precision can lead to
overfitting and inefficient learning. This occurs because considerable efforts
are devoted to capturing intra-bin variations that are ultimately irrelevant to
the discrete nature of the task at hand. Such a flaw results in diminished
molecular diversity and constrains the model's generalization capabilities. To
address this fundamental limitation, we propose GraphBFN, a novel hierarchical
coarse-to-fine framework based on Bayesian Flow Networks that operates on the
parameters of distributions. By innovatively introducing Cumulative
Distribution Function, GraphBFN is capable of calculating the probability of
selecting the correct category, thereby unifying the training objective with
the sampling rounding operation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
superior performance and faster generation, setting new state-of-the-art
results on the QM9 and ZINC250k molecular graph generation benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有框架无法确保递归自我修改的安全性，Godel机器的证明方法在随机高维环境中不可行。

Method: 引入统计Godel机器（SGM），用统计置信测试（如e值和Hoeffding边界）替代形式化证明，并提出了Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending（CTHS）方法优化错误预算分配。

Result: 实验表明，SGM在监督学习、强化学习和黑盒优化中能有效验证改进并拒绝虚假改进。

Conclusion: SGM为学习系统中的持续、风险感知的自我修改提供了基础性支持。

Abstract: Recursive self-modification is increasingly central in AutoML, neural
architecture search, and adaptive optimization, yet no existing framework
ensures that such changes are made safely. Godel machines offer a principled
safeguard by requiring formal proofs of improvement before rewriting code;
however, such proofs are unattainable in stochastic, high-dimensional settings.
We introduce the Statistical Godel Machine (SGM), the first statistical safety
layer for recursive edits. SGM replaces proof-based requirements with
statistical confidence tests (e-values, Hoeffding bounds), admitting a
modification only when superiority is certified at a chosen confidence level,
while allocating a global error budget to bound cumulative risk across
rounds.We also propose Confirm-Triggered Harmonic Spending (CTHS), which
indexes spending by confirmation events rather than rounds, concentrating the
error budget on promising edits while preserving familywise
validity.Experiments across supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and
black-box optimization validate this role: SGM certifies genuine gains on
CIFAR-100, rejects spurious improvement on ImageNet-100, and demonstrates
robustness on RL and optimization benchmarks.Together, these results position
SGM as foundational infrastructure for continual, risk-aware self-modification
in learning systems.Code is available at:

Result: 在青藏高原验证中，PSCNet在精度和误差上优于其他方法，R值达0.881，时空动态表现优异。

Conclusion: PSCNet通过有效建模SM数据的复杂时空关系，为时空降尺度提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in hydrological and meteorological
processes. High-resolution SM can be obtained by combining coarse passive
microwave data with fine-scale auxiliary variables. However, the inversion of
SM at the temporal scale is hindered by the incompleteness of surface auxiliary
factors. To address this issue, first, we introduce validated high temporal
resolution ERA5-Land variables into the downscaling process of the
low-resolution SMAP SM product. Subsequently, we design a progressive scale
convolutional network (PSCNet), at the core of which are two innovative
components: a multi-frequency temporal fusion module (MFTF) for capturing
temporal dynamics, and a bespoke squeeze-and-excitation (SE) block designed to
preserve fine-grained spatial details. Using this approach, we obtained
seamless SM products for the Tibetan Plateau (TP) from 2016 to 2018 at 10-km
spatial and 3-hour temporal resolution. The experimental results on the TP
demonstrated the following: 1) In the satellite product validation, the PSCNet
exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error, with a mean R value of 0.881,
outperforming other methods. 2) In the in-situ site validation, PSCNet
consistently ranked among the top three models for the R metric across all
sites, while also showing superior performance in overall error reduction. 3)
In the temporal generalization validation, the feasibility of using
high-temporal resolution ERA5-Land variables for downscaling was confirmed, as
all methods maintained an average relative error within 6\% for the R metric
and 2\% for the ubRMSE metric. 4) In the temporal dynamics and visualization
validation, PSCNet demonstrated excellent temporal sensitivity and vivid
spatial details. Overall, PSCNet provides a promising solution for
spatio-temporal downscaling by effectively modeling the intricate
spatio-temporal relationships in SM data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分子性质预测方法在可解释性、跨任务泛化和化学推理能力上存在不足。

Method: 基于Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct，整合分子图像和SMILES字符串，采用两阶段训练策略（SFT和RLPGR）。

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is crucial for drug discovery and materials
science, yet existing approaches suffer from limited interpretability, poor
cross-task generalization, and lack of chemical reasoning capabilities.
Traditional machine learning models struggle with task transferability, while
specialized molecular language models provide little insight into their
decision-making processes. To address these limitations, we propose
\textbf{MPPReasoner}, a multimodal large language model that incorporates
chemical reasoning for molecular property prediction. Our approach, built upon
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, integrates molecular images with SMILES strings to
enable comprehensive molecular understanding. We develop a two-stage training
strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) using 16,000 high-quality reasoning
trajectories generated through expert knowledge and multiple teacher models,
followed by Reinforcement Learning from Principle-Guided Rewards (RLPGR). RLPGR
employs verifiable, rule-based rewards that systematically evaluate chemical
principle application, molecular structure analysis, and logical consistency
through computational verification. Extensive experiments across 8 datasets
demonstrate significant performance improvements, with MPPReasoner
outperforming the best baselines by 7.91\% and 4.53\% on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution tasks respectively. MPPReasoner exhibits exceptional
cross-task generalization and generates chemically sound reasoning paths that
provide valuable insights into molecular property analysis, substantially
enhancing both interpretability and practical utility for chemists. Code is

Abstract: Exploring machine learning techniques for addressing vehicle routing problems
has attracted considerable research attention. To achieve decent and efficient
solutions, existing deep models for vehicle routing problems are typically
trained and evaluated using instances of a single size. This substantially
limits their ability to generalize across different problem sizes and thus
hampers their practical applicability. To address the issue, we propose a
continual learning based framework that sequentially trains a deep model with
instances of ascending problem sizes. Specifically, on the one hand, we design
an inter-task regularization scheme to retain the knowledge acquired from
smaller problem sizes in the model training on a larger size. On the other
hand, we introduce an intra-task regularization scheme to consolidate the model
by imitating the latest desirable behaviors during training on each size.
Additionally, we exploit the experience replay to revisit instances of formerly
trained sizes for mitigating the catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves predominantly superior performance across
various problem sizes (either seen or unseen in the training), as compared to
state-of-the-art deep models including the ones specialized for
generalizability enhancement. Meanwhile, the ablation studies on the key
designs manifest their synergistic effect in the proposed framework.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了LLMs在长上下文中信息检索的‘中间丢失’现象，提出这是对预训练中不同信息检索需求的适应，而非单纯的信息丢失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs在长上下文中表现下降的原因，揭示其与人类记忆中的首因效应和近因效应的相似性。

Method: 通过训练GPT-2和Llama变体模型，模拟人类长期和短期记忆需求，分析其表现曲线。

Result: 发现U形表现曲线是由训练数据中的长期和短期记忆需求共同作用，且受自回归特性和注意力机制影响。

Conclusion: 信息检索需求、模型架构和训练中的注意力动态共同导致LLMs的位置偏差。

Abstract: The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a "lost-in-the-middle"
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学基准主要测试知识回忆，而临床推理是一个多步骤的假设驱动过程，需要评估LLM在此类任务中的表现。

Method: 通过1762个医生设计的临床情景模拟多轮交互，要求LLM主动获取信息、选择检查并综合多步推理得出诊断。

Result: LLM在完整信息下表现良好，但在不确定性下的迭代推理中表现显著下降，存在多种认知错误模式。

Conclusion: VivaBench为评估临床决策支持系统提供了标准化基准，并揭示了LLM在复杂决策环境中的局限性。

Abstract: Clinical reasoning in medicine is a hypothesis-driven process where
physicians refine diagnoses from limited information through targeted history,
physical examination, and diagnostic investigations. In contrast, current
medical benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily assess knowledge
recall through single-turn questions, where complete clinical information is
provided upfront. To address this gap, we introduce VivaBench, a multi-turn
benchmark that evaluates sequential clinical reasoning in LLM agents. Our
dataset consists of 1762 physician-curated clinical vignettes structured as
interactive scenarios that simulate a (oral) examination in medical training,
requiring agents to actively probe for relevant findings, select appropriate
investigations, and synthesize information across multiple steps to reach a
diagnosis. While current LLMs demonstrate competence in diagnosing conditions
from well-described clinical presentations, their performance degrades
significantly when required to navigate iterative diagnostic reasoning under
uncertainty in our evaluation. Our analysis identified several failure modes
that mirror common cognitive errors in clinical practice, including: (1)
fixation on initial hypotheses, (2) inappropriate investigation ordering, (3)
premature diagnostic closure, and (4) failing to screen for critical
conditions. These patterns reveal fundamental limitations in how current LLMs
reason and make decisions under uncertainty. Through VivaBench, we provide a
standardized benchmark for evaluating conversational medical AI systems for
real-world clinical decision support. Beyond medical applications, we
contribute to the larger corpus of research on agentic AI by demonstrating how
sequential reasoning trajectories can diverge in complex decision-making
environments.

Motivation: 语言模型代理在新环境中学习效率低，限制了其在交互成本高的场景中的应用。

Method: 提出ECHO框架，利用后见经验回放生成优化轨迹，包括后见规则和更新规则。

Result: 在XMiniGrid和PeopleJoinQA上，ECHO比基线模型性能提升80%，且优于Reflexion和AWM。

Conclusion: ECHO通过更有效地利用历史经验，显著提升了语言模型代理的适应能力。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience
replay from reinforcement learning for language model agents. ECHO generates
optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed
trajectory representations in memory. We evaluate ECHO on stateful versions of
XMiniGrid, a text-based navigation and planning benchmark, and PeopleJoinQA, a
collaborative information-gathering enterprise simulation. Across both domains,
ECHO outperforms vanilla language agent baselines by up to 80%; in XMiniGrid,
it also outperforms a number of sophisticated agent architectures including
Reflexion and AWM, demonstrating faster adaptation to novel environments
through more effective utilization of past experiences.

Motivation: 传统GNN在稠密图（如点云或分子相互作用）上效率低下，且通过稀疏化处理会丢失多尺度信息。

Method: 引入多视图图元组框架，将图划分为不相交的子图，捕捉局部和长程连接，并通过异构消息传递架构学习多视图表示。

Result: 在分子性质预测和宇宙学参数推断任务中，多视图图元组模型性能优于单图基线。

Conclusion: 多视图图元组框架显著提升了GNN在稠密图上的表现，展示了其强大的表达能力和通用性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) typically scale with the number of graph edges,
making them well suited for sparse graphs but less efficient on dense graphs,
such as point clouds or molecular interactions. A common remedy is to sparsify
the graph via similarity thresholding or distance pruning, but this forces an
arbitrary choice of a single interaction scale and discards crucial information
from other scales. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view
graph-tuple framework. Instead of a single graph, our graph-tuple framework
partitions the graph into disjoint subgraphs, capturing primary local
interactions and weaker, long-range connections. We then learn multi-view
representations from the graph-tuple via a heterogeneous message-passing
architecture inspired by the theory of non-commuting operators, which we
formally prove is strictly more expressive and guarantees a lower oracle risk
compared to single-graph message-passing models. We instantiate our framework
on two scientific domains: molecular property prediction from feature-scarce
Coulomb matrices and cosmological parameter inference from geometric point
clouds. On both applications, our multi-view graph-tuple models demonstrate
better performance than single-graph baselines, highlighting the power and
versatility of our multi-view approach.

Motivation: 抗抑郁药物不依从性普遍存在，导致复发、住院、自杀风险增加和高额成本，现有检测方法要么侵入性强，要么准确性低。

Method: 使用基于Transformer的模型分析睡眠数据，推断抗抑郁药物摄入情况。

Result: 在62,000个夜晚的数据中，模型AUROC达到0.84，能跨药物类别泛化，且对剂量变化和伴随药物具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为抗抑郁药物依从性监测提供了客观、可扩展的解决方案，有望改善抑郁症治疗效果。

Abstract: Antidepressant nonadherence is pervasive, driving relapse, hospitalization,
suicide risk, and billions in avoidable costs. Clinicians need tools that
detect adherence lapses promptly, yet current methods are either invasive
(serum assays, neuroimaging) or proxy-based and inaccurate (pill counts,
pharmacy refills). We present the first noninvasive biomarker that detects
antidepressant intake from a single night of sleep. A transformer-based model
analyzes sleep data from a consumer wearable or contactless wireless sensor to
infer antidepressant intake, enabling remote, effortless, daily adherence
assessment at home. Across six datasets comprising 62,000 nights from >20,000
participants (1,800 antidepressant users), the biomarker achieved AUROC = 0.84,
generalized across drug classes, scaled with dose, and remained robust to
concomitant psychotropics. Longitudinal monitoring captured real-world
initiation, tapering, and lapses. This approach offers objective, scalable
adherence surveillance with potential to improve depression care and outcomes.

Result: 提出了更严格的遗憾界限，并在上下文老虎机中利用侧信息提供可证明的保证。

Conclusion: 探索无关的分配方法是一种高效且原则性的多组均值估计方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: We address the problem of multi-group mean estimation, which seeks to
allocate a finite sampling budget across multiple groups to obtain uniformly
accurate estimates of their means. Unlike classical multi-armed bandits, whose
objective is to minimize regret by identifying and exploiting the best arm, the
optimal allocation in this setting requires sampling every group on the order
of $\Theta(T)$ times. This fundamental distinction makes exploration-free
algorithms both natural and effective. Our work makes three contributions.
First, we strengthen the existing results on subgaussian variance concentration
using the Hanson-Wright inequality and identify a class of strictly subgaussian
distributions that yield sharper guarantees. Second, we design exploration-free
non-adaptive and adaptive algorithms, and we establish tighter regret bounds
than the existing results. Third, we extend the framework to contextual bandit
settings, an underexplored direction, and propose algorithms that leverage side
information with provable guarantees. Overall, these results position
exploration-free allocation as a principled and efficient approach to
multi-group mean estimation, with potential applications in experimental
design, personalization, and other domains requiring accurate multi-group
inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统NMF方法无法直接利用类别标签，现有监督或半监督扩展通常仅通过惩罚或图约束引入标签，仍需外部分类器。

Method: NMF-LAB将标签矩阵Y作为观测数据，协变量A作为解释变量，通过三分解直接建模协变量到标签的映射。

Result: 实验表明NMF-LAB在预测准确性、对噪声或不完整标签的鲁棒性、高维问题扩展性方面表现优异，同时保持可解释性。

Conclusion: NMF-LAB通过三分解框架统一回归和分类，提供了一种新颖、概率化且可扩展的现代分类方法。

Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is widely used for dimensionality
reduction and interpretable analysis, but standard formulations are
unsupervised and cannot directly exploit class labels. Existing supervised or
semi-supervised extensions usually incorporate labels only via penalties or
graph constraints, still requiring an external classifier. We propose
\textit{NMF-LAB} (Non-negative Matrix Factorization for Label Matrix), which
redefines classification as the inverse problem of non-negative matrix
tri-factorization (tri-NMF). Unlike joint NMF methods, which reconstruct both
features and labels, NMF-LAB directly factorizes the label matrix $Y$ as the
observation, while covariates $A$ are treated as given explanatory variables.
This yields a direct probabilistic mapping from covariates to labels,
distinguishing our method from label-matrix factorization approaches that
mainly model label correlations or impute missing labels. Our inversion offers
two key advantages: (i) class-membership probabilities are obtained directly
from the factorization without a separate classifier, and (ii) covariates,
including kernel-based similarities, can be seamlessly integrated to generalize
predictions to unseen samples. In addition, unlabeled data can be encoded as
uniform distributions, supporting semi-supervised learning. Experiments on
diverse datasets, from small-scale benchmarks to the large-scale MNIST dataset,
demonstrate that NMF-LAB achieves competitive predictive accuracy, robustness
to noisy or incomplete labels, and scalability to high-dimensional problems,
while preserving interpretability. By unifying regression and classification
within the tri-NMF framework, NMF-LAB provides a novel, probabilistic, and
scalable approach to modern classification tasks.

Conclusion: TreeDiff通过创新的设计和MCTS引导，显著提升了图生成的可控性和性能，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Graph generation is a fundamental problem in graph learning with broad
applications across Web-scale systems, knowledge graphs, and scientific domains
such as drug and material discovery. Recent approaches leverage diffusion
models for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little
control over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and
difficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods
mitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but
they remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To
overcome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search
(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.
TreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space
while keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three
key designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion
strategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,
reducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space
denoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with
lightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and
structural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term
rewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and
removing the need for full rollouts. Extensive experiments on 2D and 3D
molecular generation benchmarks, under both unconditional and conditional
settings, demonstrate that TreeDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance.
Notably, TreeDiff exhibits favorable inference-time scaling: it continues to
improve with additional computation, while existing inference-time methods
plateau early under limited resources.

Result: 发现Transformer在核特征空间中通过梯度下降学习，且softmax注意力具有更强的上下文适应性。

Conclusion: 研究增强了在更现实场景下对ICL算法的理论理解，并为更大模型的理论研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: The remarkable ability of transformers to learn new concepts solely by
reading examples within the input prompt, termed in-context learning (ICL), is
a crucial aspect of intelligent behavior. Here, we focus on understanding the
learning algorithm transformers use to learn from context. Existing theoretical
work, often based on simplifying assumptions, has primarily focused on linear
self-attention and continuous regression tasks, finding transformers can learn
in-context by gradient descent. Given that transformers are typically trained
on discrete and complex tasks, we bridge the gap from this existing work to the
setting of classification, with non-linear (importantly, softmax) activation.
We find that transformers still learn to do gradient descent in-context, though
on functionals in the kernel feature space and with a context-adaptive learning
rate in the case of softmax transformer. These theoretical findings suggest a
greater adaptability to context for softmax attention, which we empirically
verify and study through ablations. Overall, we hope this enhances theoretical
understanding of in-context learning algorithms in more realistic settings,
pushes forward our intuitions and enables further theory bridging to larger
models.

Method: 提出HiLoMoE，结合分层路由和并行执行，使用轻量级专家和分阶段训练。

Result: 在四个数据集上，AUC提升0.20%，FLOPs减少18.5%。

Conclusion: HiLoMoE在性能和效率上优于非MoE基线。

Abstract: Deep models have driven significant advances in click-through rate (CTR)
prediction. While vertical scaling via layer stacking improves model
expressiveness, the layer-by-layer sequential computation poses challenges to
efficient scaling. Conversely, horizontal scaling through Mixture of Experts
(MoE) achieves efficient scaling by activating a small subset of experts in
parallel, but flat MoE layers may struggle to capture the hierarchical
structure inherent in recommendation tasks. To push the Return-On-Investment
(ROI) boundary, we explore the complementary strengths of both directions and
propose HiLoMoE, a hierarchical LoRA MoE framework that enables holistic
scaling in a parameter-efficient manner. Specifically, HiLoMoE employs
lightweight rank-1 experts for parameter-efficient horizontal scaling, and
stacks multiple MoE layers with hierarchical routing to enable combinatorially
diverse expert compositions. Unlike conventional stacking, HiLoMoE routes based
on prior layer scores rather than outputs, allowing all layers to execute in
parallel. A principled three-stage training framework ensures stable
optimization and expert diversity. Experiments on four public datasets show
that HiLoMoE achieving better performance-efficiency tradeoff, achieving an
average AUC improvement of 0.20\% in AUC and 18.5\% reduction in FLOPs compared
to the non-MoE baseline.

Conclusion: MTL-FSL框架有效解决了特征动态相关性问题，为阿尔茨海默病研究提供了新工具。

Abstract: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in
aging populations, posing a significant and escalating burden on global
healthcare systems. While Multi-Tusk Learning (MTL) has emerged as a powerful
computational paradigm for modeling longitudinal AD data, existing frameworks
do not account for the time-varying nature of feature correlations. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel MTL framework, named Feature Similarity
Laplacian graph Multi-Task Learning (MTL-FSL). Our framework introduces a novel
Feature Similarity Laplacian (FSL) penalty that explicitly models the
time-varying relationships between features. By simultaneously considering
temporal smoothness among tasks and the dynamic correlations among features,
our model enhances both predictive accuracy and biological interpretability. To
solve the non-smooth optimization problem arising from our proposed penalty
terms, we adopt the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)
algorithm. Experiments conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our proposed MTL-FSL framework
achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline methods.

Result: 结果表明，即使计算速度大幅提升，仍需要人类初始输入（如目标定义、类别标注和种子监督）来确保模型与任务语义对齐。

Conclusion: 结论是生成式AI可以作为标签放大器，但人类监督仍是必要的，以确保系统的校准和任务对齐。

Abstract: We analyze a reversed-supervision strategy that searches over labelings of a
large unlabeled set \(B\) to minimize error on a small labeled set \(A\). The
search space is \(2^n\), and the resulting complexity remains exponential even
under large constant-factor speedups (e.g., quantum or massively parallel
hardware). Consequently, arbitrarily fast -- but not exponentially faster --
computation does not obviate the need for informative labels or priors. In
practice, the machine learning pipeline still requires an initial human
contribution: specifying the objective, defining classes, and providing a seed
set of representative annotations that inject inductive bias and align models
with task semantics. Synthetic labels from generative AI can partially
substitute provided their quality is human-grade and anchored by a
human-specified objective, seed supervision, and validation. In this view,
generative models function as \emph{label amplifiers}, leveraging small
human-curated cores via active, semi-supervised, and self-training loops, while
humans retain oversight for calibration, drift detection, and failure auditing.
Thus, extreme computational speed reduces wall-clock time but not the
fundamental supervision needs of learning; initial human (or human-grade) input
remains necessary to ground the system in the intended task.

Abstract: Simulators of animal movements play a valuable role in studying behavior.
Advances in imitation learning for robotics have expanded possibilities for
reproducing human and animal movements. A key challenge for realistic
multi-animal simulation in biology is bridging the gap between unknown
real-world transition models and their simulated counterparts. Because
locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories
and supports reward-driven optimization remains an open problem. We introduce a
data-driven simulator for multi-animal behavior based on deep reinforcement
learning and counterfactual simulation. We address the ill-posed nature of the
problem caused by high degrees of freedom in locomotion by estimating movement
variables of an incomplete transition model as actions within an RL framework.
We also employ a distance-based pseudo-reward to align and compare states
between cyber and physical spaces. Validated on artificial agents, flies,
newts, and silkmoth, our approach achieves higher reproducibility of
species-specific behaviors and improved reward acquisition compared with
standard imitation and RL methods. Moreover, it enables counterfactual behavior
prediction in novel experimental settings and supports multi-individual
modeling for flexible what-if trajectory generation, suggesting its potential
to simulate and elucidate complex multi-animal behaviors.

Motivation: 现有方法通常使用共享嵌入层处理所有通道，导致通道特定信息丢失，形成表示瓶颈。

Method: 引入Shared-Auxiliary Embedding（SAE）框架，将嵌入分解为共享基础组件和通道特定辅助组件，并利用低秩和聚类特性设计LightSAE模块。

Result: 在9个IoT相关数据集和4种骨干架构上的实验表明，LightSAE仅增加4.0%参数即可实现高达22.8%的MSE改进。

Conclusion: LightSAE通过分解嵌入和利用结构模式，显著提升了多变量时间序列预测的性能和效率。

Abstract: Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.

TL;DR: AnyBCQ是一种硬件友好的多精度量化方法，通过二进制位平面操作提升大语言模型的部署效率，支持动态精度选择，显著减少低比特（如2-bit）下的精度损失，并实现高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）的部署受限于内存和延迟瓶颈，需要灵活的量化技术以平衡精度和效率。

Method: 提出AnyBCQ，扩展Binary-Coded Quantization（BCQ），支持直接位平面操作，通过渐进式精度扩展机制逐步优化缩放因子。

Result: AnyBCQ在低比特（如2-bit）下显著减少精度损失，在高精度下保持竞争力，吞吐量比半精度提升3.0倍，比现有多精度方法提升1.2倍。

Conclusion: AnyBCQ通过算法灵活性与硬件效率的结合，为多精度LLM部署提供了实用基础。

Abstract: The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by
memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques
that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced
multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a
single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,
quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency
improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and
activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present
AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded
Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing
weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables
bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,
bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism
incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary
codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are
enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ
structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible
overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly
narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains
competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x
over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By
aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a
practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse
service-level objectives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度核的锚点最大差异（AMD）方法，用于同时学习假设和核，解决相对相似性测试中的核选择问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的方法在相对相似性测试中需要手动指定假设，导致核选择困难，测试结果可能不准确。

Method: 通过AMD方法，在深度核空间中定义相对相似性，分两阶段进行测试：估计AMD并推断假设，然后评估假设的统计显著性。

Result: 理论验证和基准数据集实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AMD方法解决了核选择与假设指定的耦合问题，提升了相对相似性测试的准确性和灵活性。

Abstract: The relative similarity testing aims to determine which of the distributions,
P or Q, is closer to an anchor distribution U. Existing kernel-based approaches
often test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified
alternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel
selection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the
manually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel
selection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified
first, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This
challenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select
a good kernel after the hypothesis is specified. In this paper, we cope with
this challenge via learning a proper hypothesis and a kernel simultaneously,
instead of learning a kernel after manually specifying the hypothesis. We
propose an anchor-based maximum discrepancy (AMD), which defines the relative
similarity as the maximum discrepancy between the distances of (U, P) and (U,
Q) in a space of deep kernels. Based on AMD, our testing incorporates two
phases. In Phase I, we estimate the AMD over the deep kernel space and infer
the potential hypothesis. In Phase II, we assess the statistical significance
of the potential hypothesis, where we propose a unified testing framework to
derive thresholds for tests over different possible hypotheses from Phase I.
Lastly, we validate our method theoretically and demonstrate its effectiveness
via extensive experiments on benchmark datasets. Codes are publicly available
at: https://github.com/zhijianzhouml/AMD.

Conclusion: RADiAnce为蛋白质结合剂设计提供了新范式，结合了检索知识和生成AI的优势。

Abstract: Designing protein binders targeting specific sites, which requires to
generate realistic and functional interaction patterns, is a fundamental
challenge in drug discovery. Current structure-based generative models are
limited in generating nterfaces with sufficient rationality and
interpretability. In this paper, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion for
Aligned interface (RADiAnce), a new framework that leverages known interfaces
to guide the design of novel binders. By unifying retrieval and generation in a
shared contrastive latent space, our model efficiently identifies relevant
interfaces for a given binding site and seamlessly integrates them through a
conditional latent diffusion generator, enabling cross-domain interface
transfer. Extensive exeriments show that RADiAnce significantly outperforms
baseline models across multiple metrics, including binding affinity and
recovery of geometries and interactions. Additional experimental results
validate cross-domain generalization, demonstrating that retrieving interfaces
from diverse domains, such as peptides, antibodies, and protein fragments,
enhances the generation performance of binders for other domains. Our work
establishes a new paradigm for protein binder design that successfully bridges
retrieval-based knowledge and generative AI, opening new possibilities for drug
discovery.

Motivation: 传统PINNs在精度、训练速度、多物理场处理等方面存在不足，需要改进。

Method: 引入梯度伪点自学习算法，构建gST-PINN模型，测试于多种PDE问题。

Result: gST-PINN在Burgers方程和扩散-吸附方程上表现优于传统PINN，MSE降至10^-5。

Conclusion: gST-PINN在无标签数据情况下仍优于传统PINN，适用于低精度和收敛问题。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) provide a mathematical foundation for
simulating and understanding intricate behaviors in both physical sciences and
engineering. With the growing capabilities of deep learning, data$-$driven
approaches like Physics$-$Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have been developed,
offering a mesh$-$free, analytic type framework for efficiently solving PDEs
across a wide range of applications. However, traditional PINNs often struggle
with challenges such as limited precision, slow training dynamics, lack of
labeled data availability, and inadequate handling of multi$-$physics
interactions. To overcome these challenging issues of PINNs, we proposed a
Gradient Enhanced Self$-$Training PINN (gST$-$PINN) method that specifically
introduces a gradient based pseudo point self$-$learning algorithm for solving
PDEs. We tested the proposed method on three different types of PDE problems
from various fields, each representing distinct scenarios. The effectiveness of
the proposed method is evident, as the PINN approach for solving the Burgers$'$
equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are
unavailable. It generalizes both PINN and Gradient$-$enhanced PINN (gPINN), and
can be effectively applied in scenarios prone to low accuracy and convergence
issues, particularly in the absence of labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有影响估计方法在训练随机性下不稳定，无法可靠用于数据清理或行为归因。

Method: 提出f-influence框架，基于假设测试；设计高效算法f-INE，单次训练完成计算。

Result: f-INE可扩展至大型模型（如Llama-3.1-8B），能可靠检测有毒样本。

Conclusion: f-influence框架和f-INE算法为数据清理和模型行为归因提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Influence estimation methods promise to explain and debug machine learning by
estimating the impact of individual samples on the final model. Yet, existing
methods collapse under training randomness: the same example may appear
critical in one run and irrelevant in the next. Such instability undermines
their use in data curation or cleanup since it is unclear if we indeed
deleted/kept the correct datapoints. To overcome this, we introduce
*f-influence* -- a new influence estimation framework grounded in hypothesis
testing that explicitly accounts for training randomness, and establish
desirable properties that make it suitable for reliable influence estimation.
We also design a highly efficient algorithm **f**-**IN**fluence **E**stimation
(**f-INE**) that computes f-influence **in a single training run**. Finally, we
scale up f-INE to estimate influence of instruction tuning data on Llama-3.1-8B
and show it can reliably detect poisoned samples that steer model opinions,
demonstrating its utility for data cleanup and attributing model behavior.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，合成数据与真实数据接近，隐私保护强，下游分类器性能优异。

Conclusion: 该方法在医疗领域实现了高保真合成数据生成，支持敏感AI应用。

Abstract: Healthcare research and development face significant obstacles due to data
scarcity and stringent privacy regulations, such as HIPAA and the GDPR,
restricting access to essential real-world medical data. These limitations
impede innovation, delay robust AI model creation, and hinder advancements in
patient-centered care. Synthetic data generation offers a transformative
solution by producing artificial datasets that emulate real data statistics
while safeguarding patient privacy. We introduce a novel hybrid framework for
high-fidelity healthcare data synthesis integrating five augmentation methods:
noise injection, interpolation, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) sampling,
Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) sampling, and SMOTE, combined via a
reinforcement learning-based dynamic weight selection mechanism. Its key
innovations include advanced calibration techniques -- moment matching, full
histogram matching, soft and adaptive soft histogram matching, and iterative
refinement -- that align marginal distributions and preserve joint feature
dependencies. Evaluated on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (UCI Repository) and
Khulna Medical College cardiology datasets, our calibrated hybrid achieves
Wasserstein distances as low as 0.001 and Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics around
0.01, demonstrating near-zero marginal discrepancy. Pairwise trend scores
surpass 90%, and Nearest Neighbor Adversarial Accuracy approaches 50%,
confirming robust privacy protection. Downstream classifiers trained on
synthetic data achieve up to 94% accuracy and F1 scores above 93%, comparable
to models trained on real data. This scalable, privacy-preserving approach
matches state-of-the-art methods, sets new benchmarks for joint-distribution
fidelity in healthcare, and supports sensitive AI applications.

Result: 在Rotated MNIST和ADNI数据集上，预测准确率和域选择效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在无监督连续域自适应中优于传统方法，有效优化了域路径选择和任务性能。

Abstract: Continuous Domain Adaptation (CDA) effectively bridges significant domain
shifts by progressively adapting from the source domain through intermediate
domains to the target domain. However, selecting intermediate domains without
explicit metadata remains a substantial challenge that has not been extensively
explored in existing studies. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel
framework that combines reinforcement learning with feature disentanglement to
conduct domain path selection in an unsupervised CDA setting. Our approach
introduces an innovative unsupervised reward mechanism that leverages the
distances between latent domain embeddings to facilitate the identification of
optimal transfer paths. Furthermore, by disentangling features, our method
facilitates the calculation of unsupervised rewards using domain-specific
features and promotes domain adaptation by aligning domain-invariant features.
This integrated strategy is designed to simultaneously optimize transfer paths
and target task performance, enhancing the effectiveness of domain adaptation
processes. Extensive empirical evaluations on datasets such as Rotated MNIST
and ADNI demonstrate substantial improvements in prediction accuracy and domain
selection efficiency, establishing our method's superiority over traditional
CDA approaches.

Result: 现有RL方法在分布偏移、难度变化和反事实场景中泛化能力不足，基准未能揭示这些缺陷。

Conclusion: 提出设计更可靠基准的三原则：足够难度、平衡评估和分布鲁棒性。

Abstract: Current benchmarks are inadequate for evaluating progress in reinforcement
learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs).Despite recent benchmark gains
reported for RL, we find that training on these benchmarks' training sets
achieves nearly the same performance as training directly on the test sets,
suggesting that the benchmarks cannot reliably separate further progress.To
study this phenomenon, we introduce a diagnostic suite and the Oracle
Performance Gap (OPG) metric that quantifies the performance difference between
training on the train split versus the test split of a benchmark. We further
analyze this phenomenon with stress tests and find that, despite strong
benchmark scores, existing RL methods struggle to generalize across
distribution shifts, varying levels of difficulty, and counterfactual
scenarios: shortcomings that current benchmarks fail to reveal.We conclude that
current benchmarks are insufficient for evaluating generalization and propose
three core principles for designing more faithful benchmarks: sufficient
difficulty, balanced evaluation, and distributional robustness.

Method: 通过链的混合时间显式建模马尔可夫依赖性，推导出新的PAC-Bayesian泛化边界，并开发了PB-SAC算法优化该边界。

Result: 实验表明，新边界为非策略算法（如Soft Actor-Critic）提供了非空泛的置信证书，同时保持性能竞争力。

Conclusion: 本文提出的边界和算法为强化学习提供了实用的泛化保证，并在实验中验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We derive a novel PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for reinforcement
learning that explicitly accounts for Markov dependencies in the data, through
the chain's mixing time. This contributes to overcoming challenges in obtaining
generalization guarantees for reinforcement learning, where the sequential
nature of data breaks the independence assumptions underlying classical bounds.
Our bound provides non-vacuous certificates for modern off-policy algorithms
like Soft Actor-Critic. We demonstrate the bound's practical utility through
PB-SAC, a novel algorithm that optimizes the bound during training to guide
exploration. Experiments across continuous control tasks show that our approach
provides meaningful confidence certificates while maintaining competitive
performance.

Result: 在公开和私有数据集上验证，MFAM优于通用时间序列模型，适用于PD严重程度的自动化评估。

Conclusion: MFAM为PD严重程度评估提供了高效、特异的解决方案。

Abstract: Severity assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) using wearable sensors offers
an effective, objective basis for clinical management. However, general-purpose
time series models often lack pathological specificity in feature extraction,
making it difficult to capture subtle signals highly correlated with
PD.Furthermore, the temporal sparsity of PD symptoms causes key diagnostic
features to be easily "diluted" by traditional aggregation methods, further
complicating assessment. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-scale
Frequency-Aware Adversarial Multi-Instance Network (MFAM). This model enhances
feature specificity through a frequency decomposition module guided by medical
prior knowledge. Furthermore, by introducing an attention-based multi-instance
learning (MIL) framework, the model can adaptively focus on the most
diagnostically valuable sparse segments.We comprehensively validated MFAM on
both the public PADS dataset for PD versus differential diagnosis (DD) binary
classification and a private dataset for four-class severity assessment.
Experimental results demonstrate that MFAM outperforms general-purpose time
series models in handling complex clinical time series with specificity,
providing a promising solution for automated assessment of PD severity.

Abstract: Classical consensus-based strategies for federated and decentralized learning
are statistically suboptimal in the presence of heterogeneous local data or
task distributions. As a result, in recent years, there has been growing
interest in multitask or personalized strategies, which allow individual agents
to benefit from one another in pursuing locally optimal models without
enforcing consensus. Existing strategies require either precise prior knowledge
of the underlying task relationships or are fully non-parametric and instead
rely on meta-learning or proximal constructions. In this work, we introduce an
algorithmic framework that strikes a balance between these extremes. By
modeling task relationships through a Gaussian Markov Random Field with an
unknown precision matrix, we develop a strategy that jointly learns both the
task relationships and the local models, allowing agents to self-organize in a
way consistent with their individual data distributions. Our theoretical
analysis quantifies the quality of the learned relationship, and our numerical
experiments demonstrate its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has achieved impressive empirical
success, yet its theoretical understanding remains limited. In this work, we
provide a theoretical perspective by formulating self-supervised representation
learning as an approximation to supervised representation learning objectives.
Based on this formulation, we derive a loss function closely related to popular
contrastive losses such as InfoNCE, offering insight into their underlying
principles. Our derivation naturally introduces the concepts of prototype
representation bias and a balanced contrastive loss, which help explain and
improve the behavior of self-supervised learning algorithms. We further show
how components of our theoretical framework correspond to established practices
in contrastive learning. Finally, we empirically validate the effect of
balancing positive and negative pair interactions. All theoretical proofs are
provided in the appendix, and our code is included in the supplementary

where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We
connect these ideas to the Spencer formalism for Lie pseudogroups and formulate
a symmetry-based, self-contained version of predictive coding in which higher
layers receive only \emph{coarse-grained residual transformations}
(prediction-error coordinates) along symmetry directions unresolved at lower
layers.

Result: 在多个公开EEG数据集上，FusionGen显著优于现有增强技术，分类准确率显著提升。

Conclusion: FusionGen为EEG数据生成提供了高效解决方案，提升了BCIs的实用性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) provide potential for applications ranging
from medical rehabilitation to cognitive state assessment by establishing
direct communication pathways between the brain and external devices via
electroencephalography (EEG). However, EEG-based BCIs are severely constrained
by data scarcity and significant inter-subject variability, which hinder the
generalization and applicability of EEG decoding models in practical settings.
To address these challenges, we propose FusionGen, a novel EEG data generation
framework based on disentangled representation learning and feature fusion. By
integrating features across trials through a feature matching fusion module and
combining them with a lightweight feature extraction and reconstruction
pipeline, FusionGen ensures both data diversity and trainability under limited
data constraints. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available EEG
datasets demonstrate that FusionGen significantly outperforms existing
augmentation techniques, yielding notable improvements in classification
accuracy.

Motivation: 在模型构建过程中，需要评估大量中间模型，但真实性能只有在评估后才能确定。如何在有限预算下高效探索中间模型空间是一个挑战。

Method: 将问题形式化为Lipschitz空间中未知值函数的预算分配问题。

Result: 提出了一种通用的预算分配方法，适用于中间模型探索。

Conclusion: 该方法为有限预算下的模型探索提供了理论支持，优化了资源分配效率。

Abstract: Building learning models frequently requires evaluating numerous intermediate
models. Examples include models considered during feature selection, model
structure search, and parameter tunings. The evaluation of an intermediate
model influences subsequent model exploration decisions. Although prior
knowledge can provide initial quality estimates, true performance is only
revealed after evaluation. In this work, we address the challenge of optimally
allocating a bounded budget to explore the space of intermediate models. We
formalize this as a general budget allocation problem over unknown-value
functions within a Lipschitz space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于金融市场的波动性和非线性特性，股票价格预测具有挑战性。传统GAN存在模式崩溃、训练不稳定等问题，限制了其应用。

Method: 采用GRU编码器-解码器框架，引入时间解码器、静态和动态协变量条件学习以及窗口机制，提升模型表现。

Result: 在多种股票数据集上，EDGAN表现出更高的预测准确性和训练稳定性，优于传统GAN变体。

Conclusion: EDGAN在波动市场中表现出色，为股票预测提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting stock prices remains challenging due to the volatile and
non-linear nature of financial markets. Despite the promise of deep learning,
issues such as mode collapse, unstable training, and difficulty in capturing
temporal and feature level correlations have limited the applications of GANs
in this domain. We propose a GRU-based Encoder-Decoder GAN (EDGAN) model that
strikes a balance between expressive power and simplicity. The model introduces
key innovations such as a temporal decoder with residual connections for
precise reconstruction, conditioning on static and dynamic covariates for
contextual learning, and a windowing mechanism to capture temporal dynamics.
Here, the generator uses a dense encoder-decoder framework with residual GRU
blocks. Extensive experiments on diverse stock datasets demonstrate that EDGAN
achieves superior forecasting accuracy and training stability, even in volatile
markets. It consistently outperforms traditional GAN variants in forecasting
accuracy and convergence stability under market conditions.

Conclusion: SDG-L框架显著提升预测性能，并通过消融实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly omnipresent in energy supply.
However, the durability of energy storage using lithium-ion batteries is
threatened by their dropping capacity with the growing number of
charging/discharging cycles. An accurate capacity prediction is the key to
ensure system efficiency and reliability, where the exploitation of battery
state information in each cycle has been largely undervalued. In this paper, we
propose a semiparametric deep Gaussian process regression framework named SDG-L
to give predictions based on the modeling of time series battery state data. By
introducing an LSTM feature extractor, the SDG-L is specially designed to
better utilize the auxiliary profiling information during charging/discharging
process. In experimental studies based on NASA dataset, our proposed method
obtains an average test MSE error of 1.2%. We also show that SDG-L achieves
better performance compared to existing works and validate the framework using
ablation studies.

TL;DR: ImpMIA是一种利用神经网络隐式偏置的白盒成员推理攻击方法，无需依赖参考模型，在现实场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒成员推理攻击方法依赖不现实的假设，如已知训练超参数和数据分布，导致性能下降。

Method: ImpMIA基于最大间隔隐式偏置理论，利用KKT最优条件，通过梯度重构模型参数来识别训练样本。

Result: ImpMIA在仅提供模型权重和训练数据超集的现实场景中，性能优于现有黑盒和白盒攻击方法。

Conclusion: ImpMIA通过消除不现实假设，显著提升了成员推理攻击在真实场景中的有效性。

Abstract: Determining which data samples were used to train a model-known as Membership
Inference Attack (MIA)-is a well-studied and important problem with
implications for data privacy. Black-box methods presume access only to the
model's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While
they have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that
rarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training
hyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same
distribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in
the evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these
assumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box
attacks. We introduce ImpMIA, a Membership Inference Attack that exploits the
Implicit Bias of neural networks, hence removes the need to rely on any
reference models and their assumptions. ImpMIA is a white-box attack -- a
setting which assumes access to model weights and is becoming increasingly
realistic given that many models are publicly available (e.g., via Hugging
Face). Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the
Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.
This is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct
the trained model's parameters. As a result, ImpMIA achieves state-of-the-art
performance compared to both black and white box attacks in realistic settings
where only the model weights and a superset of the training data are available.

Abstract: Developing effective representations of protein structures is essential for
advancing protein science, particularly for protein generative modeling.
Current approaches often grapple with the complexities of the SE(3) manifold,
rely on discrete tokenization, or the need for multiple training objectives,
all of which can hinder the model optimization and generalization. We introduce
ProteinAE, a novel and streamlined protein diffusion autoencoder designed to
overcome these challenges by directly mapping protein backbone coordinates from
E(3) into a continuous, compact latent space. ProteinAE employs a
non-equivariant Diffusion Transformer with a bottleneck design for efficient
compression and is trained end-to-end with a single flow matching objective,
substantially simplifying the optimization pipeline. We demonstrate that
ProteinAE achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality, outperforming
existing autoencoders. The resulting latent space serves as a powerful
foundation for a latent diffusion model that bypasses the need for explicit
equivariance. This enables efficient, high-quality structure generation that is
competitive with leading structure-based approaches and significantly
outperforms prior latent-based methods. Code is available at

Result: RetroTrim是唯一能有效过滤幻觉反应的方法，且在高质量路径数量上表现最佳。

Conclusion: RetroTrim为逆合成提供了可靠解决方案，其评估协议和基准目标可推动进一步研究。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis is one of the domains transformed by the rise of generative
models, and it is one where the problem of nonsensical or erroneous outputs
(hallucinations) is particularly insidious: reliable assessment of synthetic
plans is time-consuming, with automatic methods lacking. In this work, we
present RetroTrim, a retrosynthesis system that successfully avoids nonsensical
plans on a set of challenging drug-like targets. Compared to common baselines
in the field, our system is not only the sole method that succeeds in filtering
out hallucinated reactions, but it also results in the highest number of
high-quality paths overall. The key insight behind RetroTrim is the combination
of diverse reaction scoring strategies, based on machine learning models and
existing chemical databases. We show that our scoring strategies capture
different classes of hallucinations by analyzing them on a dataset of labeled
retrosynthetic intermediates. To measure the performance of retrosynthesis
systems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic
paths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we
compare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends
in drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly
applicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.
By releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,
we hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了CCD的生命周期视角，利用DT和DRL实现了持续优化和实时决策。

Abstract: Control Co-Design (CCD) integrates physical and control system design to
improve the performance of dynamic and autonomous systems. Despite advances in
uncertainty-aware CCD methods, real-world uncertainties remain highly
unpredictable. Multi-generation design addresses this challenge by considering
the full lifecycle of a product: data collected from each generation informs
the design of subsequent generations, enabling progressive improvements in
robustness and efficiency. Digital Twin (DT) technology further strengthens
this paradigm by creating virtual representations that evolve over the
lifecycle through real-time sensing, model updating, and adaptive
re-optimization. This paper presents a DT-enabled CCD framework that integrates
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to jointly optimize physical design and
controller. DRL accelerates real-time decision-making by allowing controllers
to continuously learn from data and adapt to uncertain environments. Extending
this approach, the framework employs a multi-generation paradigm, where each
cycle of deployment, operation, and redesign uses collected data to refine DT
models, improve uncertainty quantification through quantile regression, and
inform next-generation designs of both physical components and controllers. The
framework is demonstrated on an active suspension system, where DT-enabled
learning from road conditions and driving behaviors yields smoother and more
stable control trajectories. Results show that the method significantly
enhances dynamic performance, robustness, and efficiency. Contributions of this
work include: (1) extending CCD into a lifecycle-oriented multi-generation
framework, (2) leveraging DTs for continuous model updating and informed
design, and (3) employing DRL to accelerate adaptive real-time decision-making.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of inter-stock relationships is critical for stock price
forecasting. However, existing methods predominantly focus on single-state
relationships, neglecting the essential complementarity between dynamic and
static inter-stock relations. To solve this problem, we propose a Dual Relation
Fusion Network (DRFN) to capture the long-term relative stability of stock
relation structures while retaining the flexibility to respond to sudden market
shifts. Our approach features a novel relative static relation component that
models time-varying long-term patterns and incorporates overnight informational
influences. We capture dynamic inter-stock relationships through distance-aware
mechanisms, while evolving long-term structures via recurrent fusion of dynamic
relations from the prior day with the pre-defined static relations. Experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baselines across
different markets, with high sensitivity to the co-movement of relational
strength and stock price.

Abstract: Accurate climate forecasting is vital for Bangladesh, a region highly
susceptible to climate change impacts on temperature and rainfall. Existing
models often struggle to capture long-range dependencies and complex temporal
patterns in climate data. This study introduces an advanced Long Short-Term
Memory (LSTM) model integrated with an attention mechanism to enhance the
prediction of temperature and rainfall dynamics. Utilizing comprehensive
datasets from 1901-2023, sourced from NASA's POWER Project for temperature and
the Humanitarian Data Exchange for rainfall, the model effectively captures
seasonal and long-term trends. It outperforms baseline models, including
XGBoost, Simple LSTM, and GRU, achieving a test MSE of 0.2411 (normalized
units), MAE of 0.3860 degrees C, R^2 of 0.9834, and NRMSE of 0.0370 for
temperature, and MSE of 1283.67 mm^2, MAE of 22.91 mm, R^2 of 0.9639, and NRMSE
of 0.0354 for rainfall on monthly forecasts. The model demonstrates improved
robustness with only a 20 percent increase in MSE under simulated climate
trends (compared to an approximately 2.2-fold increase in baseline models
without trend features) and a 50 percent degradation under regional variations
(compared to an approximately 4.8-fold increase in baseline models without
enhancements). These results highlight the model's ability to improve
forecasting precision and offer potential insights into the physical processes
governing climate variability in Bangladesh, supporting applications in
climate-sensitive sectors.

Abstract: The generation of trees with a specified tree edit distance has significant
applications across various fields, including computational biology, structured
data analysis, and image processing. Recently, generative networks have been
increasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the
original datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative
networks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain
unclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and
construction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a
given tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given
rooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an
alphabet \Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,
ordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \Sigma with tree edit distance at most d
from T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )
and constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for
generating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,
the networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree
edit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN
and GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced
significantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%
and 48%, respectively. These findings provide a theoretical foundation towards
construction of compact generative models and open new directions for exact and
valid tree-structured data generation. An implementation of the proposed
networks is available at https://github.com/MGANN-KU/TreeGen_ReLUNetworks.

Conclusion: 集成采样是一种可证明且实用的非线性上下文赌博随机探索方法。

Abstract: We provide a unified algorithmic framework for ensemble sampling in nonlinear
contextual bandits and develop corresponding regret bounds for two most common
nonlinear contextual bandit settings: Generalized Linear Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{GLM-ES}) for generalized linear bandits and Neural Ensemble Sampling
(\texttt{Neural-ES}) for neural contextual bandits. Both methods maintain
multiple estimators for the reward model parameters via maximum likelihood
estimation on randomly perturbed data. We prove high-probability frequentist
regret bounds of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T} + d^{9/2})$ for \texttt{GLM-ES}
and $\mathcal{O}(\widetilde{d} \sqrt{T})$ for \texttt{Neural-ES}, where $d$ is
the dimension of feature vectors, $\widetilde{d}$ is the effective dimension of
a neural tangent kernel matrix, and $T$ is the number of rounds. These regret
bounds match the state-of-the-art results of randomized exploration algorithms
in nonlinear contextual bandit settings. In the theoretical analysis, we
introduce techniques that address challenges specific to nonlinear models.
Practically, we remove fixed-time horizon assumptions by developing anytime
versions of our algorithms, suitable when $T$ is unknown. Finally, we
empirically evaluate \texttt{GLM-ES}, \texttt{Neural-ES}, and their anytime
variants, demonstrating strong performance. Overall, our results establish
ensemble sampling as a provable and practical randomized exploration approach
for nonlinear contextual bandits.

Motivation: 深度神经网络通常过大且计算资源消耗高，而许多任务并不需要如此高的模型容量，导致资源浪费。

Result: 在MNIST和SVHN数据集上，ResNet-18和ResNet-34的内存占用分别减少了98.64%和96.44%，同时保持高准确率。

Conclusion: ODN方法有效平衡了模型深度与任务复杂度，显著提升了计算效率和部署可行性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have provided brilliant performance across
various tasks. However, this success often comes at the cost of unnecessarily
large model sizes, high computational demands, and substantial memory
footprints. Typically, powerful architectures are trained at full depths but
not all datasets or tasks require such high model capacity. Training very deep
architectures on relatively low-complexity datasets frequently leads to wasted
computation, unnecessary energy consumption, and excessive memory usage, which
in turn makes deployment of models on resource-constrained devices impractical.
To address this problem, we introduce Optimally Deep Networks (ODNs), which
provide a balance between model depth and task complexity. Specifically, we
propose a NAS like training strategy called progressive depth expansion, which
begins by training deep networks at shallower depths and incrementally
increases their depth as the earlier blocks converge, continuing this process
until the target accuracy is reached. ODNs use only the optimal depth for the
given datasets, removing redundant layers. This cuts down future training and
inference costs, lowers the memory footprint, enhances computational
efficiency, and facilitates deployment on edge devices. Empirical results show
that the optimal depths of ResNet-18 and ResNet-34 for MNIST and SVHN, achieve
up to 98.64 % and 96.44 % reduction in memory footprint, while maintaining a
competitive accuracy of 99.31 % and 96.08 %, respectively.

Conclusion: 高随机性SDE训练可有效缩小奖励差距，提升推理阶段的采样质量。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is increasingly used to
fine-tune diffusion models, but a key challenge arises from the mismatch
between stochastic samplers used during training and deterministic samplers
used during inference. In practice, models are fine-tuned using stochastic SDE
samplers to encourage exploration, while inference typically relies on
deterministic ODE samplers for efficiency and stability. This discrepancy
induces a reward gap, raising concerns about whether high-quality outputs can
be expected during inference. In this paper, we theoretically characterize this
reward gap and provide non-vacuous bounds for general diffusion models, along
with sharper convergence rates for Variance Exploding (VE) and Variance
Preserving (VP) Gaussian models. Methodologically, we adopt the generalized
denoising diffusion implicit models (gDDIM) framework to support arbitrarily
high levels of stochasticity, preserving data marginals throughout.
Empirically, our findings through large-scale experiments on text-to-image
models using denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO) and mixed group
relative policy optimization (MixGRPO) validate that reward gaps consistently
narrow over training, and ODE sampling quality improves when models are updated
using higher-stochasticity SDE training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在宏观经济冲击下消息传递效率低，无法有效捕捉非线性股票间依赖关系。

Method: 提出OmniGNN，利用注意力机制和Transformer，通过行业节点作为全局中介实现快速冲击传播。

Result: 在公开数据集上优于现有股票预测模型，尤其在COVID-19期间表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OmniGNN通过动态多关系建模和宏观经济整合，显著提升了金融市场的预测能力。

Abstract: In financial markets, Graph Neural Networks have been successfully applied to
modeling relational data, effectively capturing nonlinear inter-stock
dependencies. Yet, existing models often fail to efficiently propagate messages
during macroeconomic shocks. In this paper, we propose OmniGNN, an
attention-based multi-relational dynamic GNN that integrates macroeconomic
context via heterogeneous node and edge types for robust message passing.
Central to OmniGNN is a sector node acting as a global intermediary, enabling
rapid shock propagation across the graph without relying on long-range
multi-hop diffusion. The model leverages Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to
weigh neighbor contributions and employs Transformers to capture temporal
dynamics across multiplex relations. Experiments show that OmniGNN outperforms
existing stock prediction models on public datasets, particularly demonstrating
strong robustness during the COVID-19 period.

Conclusion: 该框架为优化方法提供了统一视角，并展示了新优化器的潜力。

Abstract: Optimization lies at the core of modern deep learning, yet existing methods
often face a fundamental trade-off between adapting to problem geometry and
leveraging curvature utilization. Steepest descent algorithms adapt to
different geometries through norm choices but remain strictly first-order,
whereas quasi-Newton and adaptive optimizers incorporate curvature information
but are restricted to Frobenius geometry, limiting their applicability across
diverse architectures. In this work, we propose a unified framework
generalizing steepest descent, quasi-Newton methods, and adaptive methods
through the novel notion of preconditioned matrix norms. This abstraction
reveals that widely used optimizers such as SGD and Adam, as well as more
advanced approaches like Muon and KL-Shampoo, and recent hybrids including SOAP
and SPlus, all emerge as special cases of the same principle. Within this
framework, we provide the first systematic treatment of affine and scale
invariance in the matrix-parameterized setting, establishing necessary and
sufficient conditions under generalized norms. Building on this foundation, we
introduce two new methods, $\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which
combine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our
experiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some
cases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

Method: BioOSS包含两类神经元：p神经元模拟膜电位，o神经元调控传播速度，通过局部交互产生波状传播。

Result: 在合成和真实任务中，BioOSS表现出优越性能和更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: BioOSS为模拟神经动态提供了更接近生物现实的框架，具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Today's deep learning architectures are primarily based on perceptron models,
which do not capture the oscillatory dynamics characteristic of biological
neurons. Although oscillatory systems have recently gained attention for their
closer resemblance to neural behavior, they still fall short of modeling the
intricate spatio-temporal interactions observed in natural neural circuits. In
this paper, we propose a bio-inspired oscillatory state system (BioOSS)
designed to emulate the wave-like propagation dynamics critical to neural
processing, particularly in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where complex activity
patterns emerge. BioOSS comprises two interacting populations of neurons: p
neurons, which represent simplified membrane-potential-like units inspired by
pyramidal cells in cortical columns, and o neurons, which govern propagation
velocities and modulate the lateral spread of activity. Through local
interactions, these neurons produce wave-like propagation patterns. The model
incorporates trainable parameters for damping and propagation speed, enabling
flexible adaptation to task-specific spatio-temporal structures. We evaluate
BioOSS on both synthetic and real-world tasks, demonstrating superior
performance and enhanced interpretability compared to alternative
architectures.

Result: 线性回归表现优于LSTM和Temporal Fusion Transformer。

Conclusion: 强调在开发和评估深度学习模型时，传统统计模型作为基准的重要性，并呼吁建立全球代表性的基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
models and Transformers have been widely adopted in hydrological applications,
demonstrating impressive performance amongst deep learning models and
outperforming physical models in various tasks. However, their superiority in
predicting land surface states such as terrestrial water storage (TWS) that are
dominated by many factors such as natural variability and human driven
modifications remains unclear. Here, using the open-access, globally
representative HydroGlobe dataset - comprising a baseline version derived
solely from a land surface model simulation and an advanced version
incorporating multi-source remote sensing data assimilation - we show that
linear regression is a robust benchmark, outperforming the more complex LSTM
and Temporal Fusion Transformer for TWS prediction. Our findings highlight the
importance of including traditional statistical models as benchmarks when
developing and evaluating deep learning models. Additionally, we emphasize the
critical need to establish globally representative benchmark datasets that
capture the combined impact of natural variability and human interventions.

Conclusion: 剪枝可作为简化时空问题的有效工具，帮助提取问题中最关键的元素。

Abstract: This work addresses the challenge of using a deep learning model to prune
graphs and the ability of this method to integrate explainability into
spatio-temporal problems through a new approach. Instead of applying
explainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding
of the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an
optimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the
training process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This
integration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error
while selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model
searches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important
elements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed
approach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy
obtained by pruning with the model and with other methods. The experiments
demonstrate that our method is capable of retaining a greater amount of
information as the graph reduces in size compared to the other methods used.
These results highlight the potential of pruning as a tool for developing
models capable of simplifying spatio-temporal problems, thereby obtaining their
most important elements.

Method: 提出MARCD方法，包括推断潜在制度、训练扩散模型、生成情景并输入CVaR分配器。

Result: 在2005-2025年测试中，MARCD表现优于标准分配器，Sharpe比率提升至1.23，最大回撤减少34%。

Conclusion: MARCD为尾部情景建模到投资组合决策提供了可重复的桥梁，显著改善了回撤控制。

Abstract: We study whether regime-conditioned generative scenarios, coupled with a
convex CVaR allocator, improve portfolio decisions under regime shifts. We
introduce Multi-Agent Regime-Conditioned Diffusion (MARCD), which (i) infers
latent regimes via a Gaussian HMM, (ii) trains a diffusion model with a
tail-weighted objective and a regime-specialized mixture-of-experts (MoE)
denoiser to enrich crisis co-movements, and (iii) feeds the generated scenarios
into a turnover-aware CVaR epigraph quadratic program with explicit governance.
In strict walk-forward tests on liquid multi-asset ETFs (2005-2025), MARCD
outperforms standard allocators and improves calibration relative to popular
generators. Over 2020-2025 out-of-sample (monthly; 10 bps), MARCD attains
Sharpe 1.23 (BL 1.02) and MaxDD 9.3 percent (BL 14.1 percent), a 34 percent
reduction, at comparable turnover; stationary block-bootstrap intervals
indicate the Sharpe uplift is significant at 5 percent. We provide theory
linking tail-weighted diffusion to spectral-risk control of the
decision-relevant CVaR gap, oracle/consistency results for the regime-MoE
denoiser, and Lipschitz/regret guarantees for the allocator. Together, MARCD
offers a reproducible bridge from tail-faithful scenario modeling to governed
portfolio decisions with materially improved drawdown control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于隐私问题，数据提供者通常会对数据集进行匿名化处理，但不同的匿名化配置会导致数据效用不同，因此需要高效确定最优配置。

Method: AEGIS通过估计特征-标签联合分布（使用有限数据摘要或无原始数据）和迭代比例拟合方法，支持多种相关性量化方法（如g3、互信息或卡方检验）。

Result: 实验表明，AEGIS能比基线方法快一个数量级确定最优配置，且匿名化后的数据集在下游ML任务中表现与基线相当。

Conclusion: AEGIS提供了一种高效且隐私友好的方法，用于优化匿名化数据集的效用。

Abstract: Data-sharing ecosystems enable entities -- such as providers, consumers, and
intermediaries -- to access, exchange, and utilize data for various downstream
tasks and applications. Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically
anonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple
masking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.
Consequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal
masking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents
AEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration
for machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We
introduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a
metric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after
masking. Our framework leverages limited data summaries (such as 1D histograms)
or none to estimate the feature-label joint distribution, making it suitable
for scenarios where raw data is inaccessible due to privacy restrictions. To
achieve this, we propose a joint distribution estimator based on iterative
proportional fitting, which allows supporting various feature-label correlation
quantification methods such as g3, mutual information, or chi-square. Our
experimental evaluation on real-world datasets shows that AEGIS identifies
optimal masking configurations over an order of magnitude faster, while the
resulting masked datasets achieve predictive performance on downstream ML tasks
that is on par with baseline approaches.

Motivation: 现有LLM-GNN融合策略对所有节点统一应用，性能提升有限，缺乏针对性。

Method: 提出GLANCE框架，使用轻量级路由器决定是否调用LLM，基于节点信号优化预测。

Result: GLANCE在异质性节点上性能提升显著（最高+13%），同时保持整体性能最优。

Conclusion: 自适应、节点感知的GNN-LLM架构能高效利用LLM，降低计算成本。

Abstract: Learning on text-attributed graphs has motivated the use of Large Language
Models (LLMs) for graph learning. However, most fusion strategies are applied
uniformly across all nodes and attain only small overall performance gains. We
argue this result stems from aggregate metrics that obscure when LLMs provide
benefit, inhibiting actionable signals for new strategies. In this work, we
reframe LLM-GNN fusion around nodes where GNNs typically falter. We first show
that performance can significantly differ between GNNs and LLMs, with each
excelling on distinct structural patterns, such as local homophily. To leverage
this finding, we propose GLANCE (GNN with LLM Assistance for Neighbor- and
Context-aware Embeddings), a framework that invokes an LLM to refine a GNN's
prediction. GLANCE employs a lightweight router that, given inexpensive
per-node signals, decides whether to query the LLM. Since the LLM calls are
non-differentiable, the router is trained with an advantage-based objective
that compares the utility of querying the LLM against relying solely on the
GNN. Across multiple benchmarks, GLANCE achieves the best performance balance
across node subgroups, achieving significant gains on heterophilous nodes (up
to $+13\%$) while simultaneously achieving top overall performance. Our
findings highlight the value of adaptive, node-aware GNN-LLM architectures,
where selectively invoking the LLM enables scalable deployment on large graphs
without incurring high computational costs.

Conclusion: 该研究为离散状态扩散模型的理论可解性和实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in generating
high-dimensional samples across domains such as vision, language, and the
sciences. Although continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively
studied both empirically and theoretically, discrete-state diffusion models,
essential for applications involving text, sequences, and combinatorial
structures, remain significantly less understood from a theoretical standpoint.
In particular, all existing analyses of discrete-state models assume score
estimation error bounds without studying sample complexity results. In this
work, we present a principled theoretical framework for discrete-state
diffusion, providing the first sample complexity bound of
$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$. Our structured decomposition of the
score estimation error into statistical, approximation, optimization, and
clipping components offers critical insights into how discrete-state models can
be trained efficiently. This analysis addresses a fundamental gap in the
literature and establishes the theoretical tractability and practical relevance
of discrete-state diffusion models.

Abstract: Several learned policies have been proposed to replace heuristics for
scheduling, caching, and other system components in modern systems. By
leveraging diverse features, learning from historical trends, and predicting
future behaviors, such models promise to keep pace with ever-increasing
workload dynamism and continuous hardware evolution. However, policies trained
in isolation may still achieve suboptimal performance when placed together. In
this paper, we inspect one such instance in the domain of hardware caching --
for the policies of cache replacement and prefetching. We argue that these two
policies are bidirectionally interdependent and make the case for training the
two jointly. We propose a joint learning approach based on developing shared
representations for the features used by the two policies. We present two
approaches to develop these shared representations, one based on a joint
encoder and another based on contrastive learning of the embeddings, and
demonstrate promising preliminary results for both of these. Finally, we lay
down an agenda for future research in this direction.

Conclusion: 自适应滤波器设计对图嵌入的表达能力至关重要，能够适应不同异质性程度的图结构。

Abstract: Graph heterophily, where connected nodes have different labels, has attracted
significant interest recently. Most existing works adopt a simplified approach
- using low-pass filters for homophilic graphs and high-pass filters for
heterophilic graphs. However, we discover that the relationship between graph
heterophily and spectral filters is more complex - the optimal filter response
varies across frequency components and does not follow a strict monotonic
correlation with heterophily degree. This finding challenges conventional fixed
filter designs and suggests the need for adaptive filtering to preserve
expressiveness in graph embeddings. Formally, natural questions arise: Given a
heterophilic graph G, how and to what extent will the varying heterophily
degree of G affect the performance of GNNs? How can we design adaptive filters
to fit those varying heterophilic connections? Our theoretical analysis reveals
that the average frequency response of GNNs and graph heterophily degree do not
follow a strict monotonic correlation, necessitating adaptive graph filters to
guarantee good generalization performance. Hence, we propose [METHOD NAME], a
simple yet powerful GNN, which extracts information across the heterophily
spectrum and combines salient representations through adaptive mixing. [METHOD
NAME]'s superior performance achieves up to 9.2% accuracy improvement over
leading baselines across homophilic and heterophilic graphs.

Conclusion: 梯度唯一性是一种直观且通用的隐私审计方法，优于传统方法。

Abstract: Disclosing private information via publication of a machine learning model is
often a concern. Intuitively, publishing a learned model should be less risky
than publishing a dataset. But how much risk is there? In this paper, we
present a principled disclosure metric called \emph{gradient uniqueness} that
is derived from an upper bound on the amount of information disclosure from
publishing a learned model. Gradient uniqueness provides an intuitive way to
perform privacy auditing. The mathematical derivation of gradient uniqueness is
general, and does not make any assumption on the model architecture, dataset
type, or the strategy of an attacker. We examine a simple defense based on
monitoring gradient uniqueness, and find that it achieves privacy comparable to
classical methods such as DP-SGD, while being substantially better in terms of
(utility) testing accuracy.

Conclusion: 长时时频表示与自适应融合结合为时间序列异常检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection(TSAD) is a critical task in signal processing
field, ensuring the reliability of complex systems. Reconstruction-based
methods dominate in TSAD. Among these methods, VAE-based methods have achieved
promising results. Existing VAE-based methods suffer from the limitation of
single-window feature and insufficient leveraging of long-term time and
frequency information. We propose a Conditional Variational AutoEncoder with
Long-term dependency and Probabilistic time-frequency fusion, named LPCVAE.
LPCVAE introduces LSTM to capture long-term dependencies beyond windows. It
further incorporates a Product-of-Experts (PoE) mechanism for adaptive and
distribution-level probabilistic fusion. This design effectively mitigates
time-frequency information loss. Extensive experiments on four public datasets
demonstrate it outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The results confirm that
integrating long-term time and frequency representations with adaptive fusion
yields a robust and efficient solution for TSAD.

Conclusion: PerSyn有效解决了教师输出与学生可学习性不匹配的问题，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Training student models on synthetic data generated by strong teacher models
is a promising way to distilling the capabilities of teachers. However, recent
studies show that stronger models are not always optimal teachers, revealing a
mismatch between teacher outputs and student learnability. To address this
issue, we propose PerSyn (Personalized data Synthesis), a novel synthesis
strategy that operates under a new ``Route then Generate'' paradigm to create
data tailored to each student model, enabling it to learn more effectively.
Specifically, PerSyn first assigns each prompt to its optimal teacher via a
query-level router that jointly considers student learnability and teacher
response quality. Each teacher then synthesizes data only for its assigned
prompts, making the process more efficient than the conventional ``Generate
then Select'' paradigm, where all teachers must generate parallel responses for
the entire prompt set before constructing the final dataset. Extensive
experiments across different model families and scales demonstrate that PerSyn
consistently achieves superior or comparable performance to all baselines in
instruct tuning and math reasoning settings. Further analysis verifies the
effectiveness of PerSyn and offers extra insights to propel future research.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.

Motivation: 传统信息理论将冗余视为低效，但有限和结构化系统中冗余可能对稳定性和泛化性至关重要。

Method: 通过定义冗余为一类信息散度，统一了多种经典度量（如互信息、卡方依赖等），并提出了冗余的上下界理论。

Result: 实验表明，在掩码自编码器中，冗余水平与泛化性能存在最优平衡点。

Conclusion: 冗余是可测量和可调节的量，连接了通信的渐近世界和学习的有限世界。

Abstract: We present a theoretical framework that extends classical information theory
to finite and structured systems by redefining redundancy as a fundamental
property of information organization rather than inefficiency. In this
framework, redundancy is expressed as a general family of informational
divergences that unifies multiple classical measures, such as mutual
information, chi-squared dependence, and spectral redundancy, under a single
geometric principle. This reveals that these traditional quantities are not
isolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory
further predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise
to an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)
and over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors
minimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,
such as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and
generalization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are
used to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable
redundancy level where generalization peaks. Together, these results establish
redundancy as a measurable and tunable quantity that bridges the asymptotic
world of communication and the finite world of learning.

TL;DR: 利用社会健康决定因素（SDOH）预测认知表现，早期发现阿尔茨海默病（AD），方法优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期发现AD至关重要，因其神经退行性效应不可逆，且风险因素在诊断前多年积累。

Method: 使用SVD插补处理缺失数据，XGBoost模型预测认知表现。

Result: 框架表现优于现有方法，识别出关键SDOH因素如地板材料、年龄等。

Conclusion: SDOH模型有助于理解认知老化的多因素性质，支持早期干预和资源分配。

Abstract: Early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is crucial because its
neurodegenerative effects are irreversible, and neuropathologic and
social-behavioral risk factors accumulate years before diagnosis. Identifying
higher-risk individuals earlier enables prevention, timely care, and equitable
resource allocation. We predict cognitive performance from social determinants
of health (SDOH) using the NIH NIA-supported PREPARE Challenge Phase 2 dataset
derived from the nationally representative Mex-Cog cohort of the 2003 and 2012
Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS).
  Data: The target is a validated composite cognitive score across seven
domains-orientation, memory, attention, language, constructional praxis, and
executive function-derived from the 2016 and 2021 MHAS waves. Predictors span
demographic, socioeconomic, health, lifestyle, psychosocial, and healthcare
access factors.
  Methodology: Missingness was addressed with a singular value decomposition
(SVD)-based imputation pipeline treating continuous and categorical variables
separately. This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover
missing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating
multiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.
  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the
data challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and
interpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH
factors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged
as a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.
Other influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,
stress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and
the value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练中策略熵崩溃导致探索不足，固定系数的熵正则化效果不稳定，需要动态调整熵正则化以优化推理性能。

Method: 提出AER框架，包含难度感知系数分配、初始锚定目标熵和动态全局系数调整三个组件，动态平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AER表现优于基线方法，提高了推理准确性和探索能力。

Conclusion: AER通过动态调整熵正则化，有效解决了RLVR训练中的熵崩溃问题，提升了模型的推理和探索性能。

Abstract: Reasoning ability has become a defining capability of Large Language Models
(LLMs), with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) emerging as
a key paradigm to enhance it. However, RLVR training often suffers from policy
entropy collapse, where the policy becomes overly deterministic, hindering
exploration and limiting reasoning performance. While entropy regularization is
a common remedy, its effectiveness is highly sensitive to the fixed
coefficient, making it unstable across tasks and models. In this work, we
revisit entropy regularization in RLVR and argue that its potential has been
largely underestimated. Our analysis shows that (i) tasks of varying difficulty
demand distinct exploration intensities, and (ii) balanced exploration may
require the policy entropy to be maintained within a moderate range below its
initial level. Therefore, we propose Adaptive Entropy Regularization (AER)--a
framework that dynamically balances exploration and exploitation via three
components: difficulty-aware coefficient allocation, initial-anchored target
entropy, and dynamic global coefficient adjustment. Experiments on multiple
mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that AER consistently outperforms
baselines, improving both reasoning accuracy and exploration capability.

TL;DR: MC#框架通过静态量化和动态专家剪枝，显著压缩MoE模型的存储和计算开销，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型因预加载所有专家和激活多个专家导致计算和内存开销大，需高效压缩方法。

Method: 结合PMQ（预加载混合精度量化）和OTP（在线Top-any剪枝），静态优化位宽和动态选择专家。

Result: 在DeepSeek-VL2上实现6.2倍权重压缩，仅1.7%精度损失；OTP减少20%专家激活。

Conclusion: MC#为高效部署MoE模型提供了强有力解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) effectively scales large language models (LLMs) and
vision-language models (VLMs) by increasing capacity through sparse activation.
However, preloading all experts into memory and activating multiple experts per
input introduces significant computational and memory overhead, making the
expert module a major contributor to model size and inference cost. To address
this, we propose MC# (Mixture-Compressor-sharp), a framework that combines
static quantization and dynamic expert pruning by leveraging the significance
of experts and tokens for aggressive compression of MoE-LLMs/VLMs. To reduce
storage and loading costs, we introduce Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision
Quantization (PMQ), which optimizes bit allocation via linear programming,
balancing expert importance and quantization error for a Pareto-optimal
trade-off between size and performance. To reduce runtime computation, Online
Top-any Pruning (OTP) uses Gumbel-Softmax sampling to dynamically select a
subset of experts per token, enabling fine-grained control over activation. By
combining PMQ's static bit-width optimization with OTP's dynamic routing, MC#
achieves extreme compression with minimal accuracy loss. On DeepSeek-VL2, MC#
achieves a 6.2 times weight reduction at 2.57 average bits with only a 1.7%
accuracy drop across five multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, OTP reduces
expert activation over 20% with less than 1% performance degradation,
demonstrating strong potential for efficient MoE-based model deployment.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应边际机制，通过动态调整奖励模型对更具挑战性样本的关注，显著提升了性能、收敛速度和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Bradley-Terry（BT）目标在成对偏好学习中表现简单但强大，但BT奖励模型难以区分相似偏好响应，导致泛化能力不足。

Method: 通过结合语义相似度和模型预测奖励差异，设计了一种基于最优传输（OT）的自适应边际机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个基准测试中优于现有技术，显著提升了分布内和分布外性能。

Conclusion: 自适应边际机制有效提升了奖励模型的性能，并在RLHF实验中更好地对齐了LLMs与人类偏好。

Abstract: The reward model (RM) plays a crucial role in aligning Large Language Models
(LLMs) with human preferences through Reinforcement Learning, where the
Bradley-Terry (BT) objective has been recognized as simple yet powerful,
specifically for pairwise preference learning. However, BT-based RMs often
struggle to effectively distinguish between similar preference responses,
leading to insufficient separation between preferred and non-preferred outputs.
Consequently, they may easily overfit easy samples and cannot generalize well
to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) samples, resulting in suboptimal performance. To
address these challenges, this paper introduces an effective enhancement to
BT-based RMs through an adaptive margin mechanism. Specifically, we design to
dynamically adjust the RM focus on more challenging samples through margins,
based on both semantic similarity and model-predicted reward differences, which
is approached from a distributional perspective solvable with Optimal Transport
(OT). By incorporating these factors into a principled OT cost matrix design,
our adaptive margin enables the RM to better capture distributional differences
between chosen and rejected responses, yielding significant improvements in
performance, convergence speed, and generalization capabilities. Experimental
results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms
several existing RM techniques, showcasing enhanced performance in both
In-Distribution (ID) and OOD settings. Moreover, RLHF experiments support our
practical effectiveness in better aligning LLMs with human preferences. Our

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 4-bit量化在非推理模型和零样本任务中是内存最优选择，但对推理模型无效，KV缓存成为内存主导。研究发现，模型大小决定内存分配策略：小模型应优先权重，大模型应优先生成长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨4-bit量化在推理模型中的适用性，发现其不适用于KV缓存主导内存的场景，需针对不同规模模型制定不同优化策略。

Method: 在AIME25和GPQA-Diamond数据集上进行了1,700次推理场景的系统实验，分析模型规模对内存分配的影响。

Result: 小模型（<8-bit 4B参数）通过分配更多内存给权重提升精度，大模型则通过分配更多内存给生成长度提升精度。

Conclusion: 推理模型的优化需不同于非推理模型，小模型优先模型容量，大模型优先计算资源。

Abstract: While 4-bit quantization has emerged as a memory-optimal choice for
non-reasoning models and zero-shot tasks across scales, we show that this
universal prescription fails for reasoning models, where the KV cache rather
than model size can dominate memory. Through systematic experiments across
1,700 inference scenarios on AIME25 and GPQA-Diamond, we find a scale-dependent
trade-off: models with an effective size below 8-bit 4B parameters achieve
better accuracy by allocating memory to more weights rather than longer
generation, while larger models achieve better accuracy by allocating memory to
longer generations. This scale threshold also determines when parallel scaling
becomes memory-efficient and whether KV cache eviction outperforms KV
quantization. Our findings show that memory optimization for LLMs cannot be
scale-agnostic, while providing principled guidelines: for small reasoning
models, prioritize model capacity over test-time compute, while for larger
ones, maximize test-time compute. Our results suggest that optimizing reasoning
models for deployment requires fundamentally different strategies from those
established for non-reasoning models.

Conclusion: Blade是一种高效且强大的无导数贝叶斯反演方法。

Abstract: Derivative-free Bayesian inversion is an important task in many science and
engineering applications, particularly when computing the forward model
derivative is computationally and practically challenging. In this paper, we
introduce Blade, which can produce accurate and well-calibrated posteriors for
Bayesian inversion using an ensemble of interacting particles. Blade leverages
powerful data-driven priors based on diffusion models, and can handle nonlinear
forward models that permit only black-box access (i.e., derivative-free).
Theoretically, we establish a non-asymptotic convergence analysis to
characterize the effects of forward model and prior estimation errors.
Empirically, Blade achieves superior performance compared to existing
derivative-free Bayesian inversion methods on various inverse problems,
including challenging highly nonlinear fluid dynamics.

Conclusion: 为理解Barlow Twins的有效性提供了理论基础，并为分析自监督学习算法提供了新视角。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable success by learning
meaningful representations without labeled data. However, a unified theoretical
framework for understanding and comparing the efficiency of different SSL
paradigms remains elusive. In this paper, we introduce a novel
information-geometric framework to quantify representation efficiency. We
define representation efficiency $\eta$ as the ratio between the effective
intrinsic dimension of the learned representation space and its ambient
dimension, where the effective dimension is derived from the spectral
properties of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) on the statistical manifold
induced by the encoder. Within this framework, we present a theoretical
analysis of the Barlow Twins method. Under specific but natural assumptions, we
prove that Barlow Twins achieves optimal representation efficiency ($\eta = 1$)
by driving the cross-correlation matrix of representations towards the identity
matrix, which in turn induces an isotropic FIM. This work provides a rigorous
theoretical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of Barlow Twins and
offers a new geometric perspective for analyzing SSL algorithms.

Result: NEs在多种视觉骨干网络和先进视觉语言模型中保持性能，而非目标模型即使尝试重建也会崩溃。

Conclusion: NEs是一种实用的方法，既能保留数据效用，又能防止未经授权的利用。

Abstract: Recent AI regulations call for data that remain useful for innovation while
resistant to misuse, balancing utility with protection at the model level.
Existing approaches either perturb data to make it unlearnable or retrain
models to suppress transfer, but neither governs inference by unknown models,
and both typically require control over training. We propose non-transferable
examples (NEs), a training-free and data-agnostic input-side usage-control
mechanism. We recode inputs within a model-specific low-sensitivity subspace,
preserving outputs for the authorized model while reducing performance on
unauthorized models through subspace misalignment. We establish formal bounds
that guarantee utility for the authorized model and quantify deviation for
unauthorized ones, with the Hoffman-Wielandt inequality linking degradation to
spectral differences. Empirically, NEs retain performance on diverse vision
backbones and state-of-the-art vision-language models under common
preprocessing, whereas non-target models collapse even with reconstruction
attempts. These results establish NEs as a practical means to preserve intended
data utility while preventing unauthorized exploitation. Our project is

Conclusion: 指令感知的用户建模能有效实现特定场景下的指令引导去噪，推动更通用和鲁棒的用户表示学习。

Abstract: User representation modeling has become increasingly crucial for personalized
applications, yet existing approaches struggle with generalizability across
domains and sensitivity to noisy behavioral signals. We present InstructUE, an
instruction-aware user embedding foundation model that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to generate general and instruction-aware user representations.
InstructUE introduces a multi-encoder architecture with a lightweight adapter
that efficiently processes heterogeneous data from six different sources while
preserving their structural characteristics. Additionally, it proposes a novel
contrastive-autoregressive training framework that bridges language and
representation spaces through a curated UserQA dataset. The
contrastive-autoregressive training framework simultaneously leverages
autoregressive learning to capture domain knowledge in language space and
contrastive learning to align user-text embeddings in representation space,
thereby enhancing the instruction-awareness and noise-robustness of user
embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real-world applications, we
demonstrate that InstructUE significantly outperforms existing methods across
multiple domains including user prediction, marketing, and recommendation
scenarios. Our results show that instruction-aware user modeling can
effectively achieve instruction-guided denoising of user information in
specific scenarios, paving the way for more generalizable and robust user
representation learning.

Method: 提出AIGN量化样本对抗脆弱性，基于此设计EasyCore算法选择低AIGN样本。

Result: EasyCore在标准训练和TRADES对抗训练中分别提升7%和5%的对抗准确率。

Conclusion: EasyCore是一种高效且广泛适用的数据中心方法，显著提升模型对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: Designing adversarially robust models from a data-centric perspective
requires understanding which input samples are most crucial for learning
resilient features. While coreset selection provides a mechanism for efficient
training on data subsets, current algorithms are designed for clean accuracy
and fall short in preserving robustness. To address this, we propose a
framework linking a sample's adversarial vulnerability to its
\textit{hardness}, which we quantify using the average input gradient norm
(AIGN) over training. We demonstrate that \textit{easy} samples (with low AIGN)
are less vulnerable and occupy regions further from the decision boundary.
Leveraging this insight, we present EasyCore, a coreset selection algorithm
that retains only the samples with low AIGN for training. We empirically show
that models trained on EasyCore-selected data achieve significantly higher
adversarial accuracy than those trained with competing coreset methods under
both standard and adversarial training. As AIGN is a model-agnostic dataset
property, EasyCore is an efficient and widely applicable data-centric method
for improving adversarial robustness. We show that EasyCore achieves up to 7\%
and 5\% improvement in adversarial accuracy under standard training and TRADES
adversarial training, respectively, compared to existing coreset methods.

Result: 新框架在保持覆盖保证的同时，预测区域体积比传统方法减小80%。

Conclusion: 该框架为图时间序列提供了高效的预测不确定性量化方法。

Abstract: Trustworthy decision making in networked, dynamic environments calls for
innovative uncertainty quantification substrates in predictive models for graph
time series. Existing conformal prediction (CP) methods have been applied
separately to multivariate time series and static graphs, but they either
ignore the underlying graph topology or neglect temporal dynamics. To bridge
this gap, here we develop a CP-based sequential prediction region framework
tailored for graph time series. A key technical innovation is to leverage the
graph structure and thus capture pairwise dependencies across nodes, while
providing user-specified coverage guarantees on the predictive outcomes. We
formally establish that our scheme yields an exponential shrinkage in the
volume of the ellipsoidal prediction set relative to its graph-agnostic
counterpart. Using real-world datasets, we demonstrate that the novel
uncertainty quantification framework maintains desired empirical coverage while
achieving markedly smaller (up to 80% reduction) prediction regions than
existing approaches.

Conclusion: TAG是一种通用解决方案，能有效解决扩散模型中的偏离问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success as generative models.
However, even a well-trained model can accumulate errors throughout the
generation process. These errors become particularly problematic when arbitrary
guidance is applied to steer samples toward desired properties, which often
breaks sample fidelity. In this paper, we propose a general solution to address
the off-manifold phenomenon observed in diffusion models. Our approach
leverages a time predictor to estimate deviations from the desired data
manifold at each timestep, identifying that a larger time gap is associated
with reduced generation quality. We then design a novel guidance mechanism,
`Temporal Alignment Guidance' (TAG), attracting the samples back to the desired
manifold at every timestep during generation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that TAG consistently produces samples closely aligned with the
desired manifold at each timestep, leading to significant improvements in
generation quality across various downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法在可穿戴医疗系统中具有实际应用潜力，SI-SDR损失和HR监督的互补作用显著。

Abstract: Photoplethysmography (PPG) is widely used in wearable health monitoring, but
its reliability is often degraded by noise and motion artifacts, limiting
downstream applications such as heart rate (HR) estimation. This paper presents
a deep learning framework for PPG denoising with an emphasis on preserving
physiological information. In this framework, we propose DPNet, a Mamba-based
denoising backbone designed for effective temporal modeling. To further enhance
denoising performance, the framework also incorporates a scale-invariant
signal-to-distortion ratio (SI-SDR) loss to promote waveform fidelity and an
auxiliary HR predictor (HRP) that provides physiological consistency through
HR-based supervision. Experiments on the BIDMC dataset show that our method
achieves strong robustness against both synthetic noise and real-world motion
artifacts, outperforming conventional filtering and existing neural models. Our
method can effectively restore PPG signals while maintaining HR accuracy,
highlighting the complementary roles of SI-SDR loss and HR-guided supervision.
These results demonstrate the potential of our approach for practical
deployment in wearable healthcare systems.

Conclusion: AT-GRPO有效解决了MAS中的RL挑战，并在多个任务中展示了卓越性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) and reinforcement learning (RL) are widely used to
enhance the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). MAS improves
task performance through role-based orchestration, while RL uses environmental
rewards to learn stronger policies, such as GRPO-style optimization. However,
applying on-policy RL to MAS remains underexplored and presents unique
challenges. Algorithmically, standard GRPO grouping assumptions break down
because prompts vary by role and by turn. System-wise, the training stack must
support MAS-workflow rollouts and on-policy updates for both single-policy and
multi-policy models.
  We propose AT-GRPO, which includes (i) an agent- and turn-wise grouped RL
algorithm tailored to MAS and (ii) a training system that supports both single-
and multi-policy regimes. Across game, planning, coding, and math tasks,
AT-GRPO delivers substantial gains. On long-horizon planning, it increases
accuracy from a 14.0 to 47.0 percent single-agent RL baseline to 96.0 to 99.5
percent. It also improves reasoning performance, with average gains of 3.87 to

Conclusion: TED为资源受限的边缘设备提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Edge devices face significant challenges due to limited computational
resources and distribution shifts, making efficient and adaptable machine
learning essential. Existing test-time adaptation (TTA) methods often rely on
gradient-based optimization or batch processing, which are inherently
unsuitable for resource-constrained edge scenarios due to their reliance on
backpropagation and high computational demands. Gradient-free alternatives
address these issues but often suffer from limited learning capacity, lack
flexibility, or impose architectural constraints. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel single-instance TTA method tailored for edge
devices (TED), which employs forward-only coordinate optimization in the
principal subspace of latent using the covariance matrix adaptation evolution
strategy (CMA-ES). By updating a compact low-dimensional vector, TED not only
enhances output confidence but also aligns the latent representation closer to
the source latent distribution within the latent principal subspace. This is
achieved without backpropagation, keeping the model parameters frozen, and
enabling efficient, forgetting-free adaptation with minimal memory and
computational overhead. Experiments on image classification and keyword
spotting tasks across the ImageNet and Google Speech Commands series datasets
demonstrate that TED achieves state-of-the-art performance while
$\textit{reducing computational complexity by up to 63 times}$, offering a
practical and scalable solution for real-world edge applications. Furthermore,
we successfully $\textit{deployed TED on the ZYNQ-7020 platform}$,
demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness for resource-constrained edge

Conclusion: CDRL4AD在多变量时间序列异常检测中表现出色，并能辅助专家诊断根因。

Abstract: Disentangling complex causal relationships is important for accurate
detection of anomalies. In multivariate time series analysis, dynamic
interactions among data variables over time complicate the interpretation of
causal relationships. Traditional approaches assume statistical independence
between variables in unsupervised settings, whereas recent methods capture
feature correlations through graph representation learning. However, their
representations fail to explicitly infer the causal relationships over
different time periods. To solve the problem, we propose Causally Disentangled
Representation Learning for Anomaly Detection (CDRL4AD) to detect anomalies and
identify their causal relationships in multivariate time series. First, we
design the causal process as model input, the temporal heterogeneous graph, and
causal relationships. Second, our representation identifies causal
relationships over different time periods and disentangles latent variables to
infer the corresponding causal factors. Third, our experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate that CDRL4AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms
of accuracy and root cause analysis. Fourth, our model analysis validates
hyperparameter sensitivity and the time complexity of CDRL4AD. Last, we conduct
a case study to show how our approach assists human experts in diagnosing the
root causes of anomalies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决生理信号应用中因硬件限制或运动伪影导致的模态缺失问题。

Method: 结合对比学习和掩码预测的自监督学习、双路径神经网络主干和恢复解码器。

Result: 在各种缺失模态场景下表现出高一致性和泛化性能。

Conclusion: PhysioME在数据不完整的情况下支持临床决策，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Missing or corrupted modalities are common in physiological signal-based
medical applications owing to hardware constraints or motion artifacts.
However, most existing methods assume the availability of all modalities,
resulting in substantial performance degradation in the absence of any
modality. To overcome this limitation, this study proposes PhysioME, a robust
framework designed to ensure reliable performance under missing modality
conditions. PhysioME adopts: (1) a multimodal self-supervised learning approach
that combines contrastive learning with masked prediction; (2) a
Dual-PathNeuroNet backbone tailored to capture the temporal dynamics of each
physiological signal modality; and (3) a restoration decoder that reconstructs
missing modality tokens, enabling flexible processing of incomplete inputs. The
experimental results show that PhysioME achieves high consistency and
generalization performance across various missing modality scenarios. These
findings highlight the potential of PhysioME as a reliable tool for supporting
clinical decision-making in real-world settings with imperfect data
availability.

TL;DR: 小规模专用LLM通过精细调优，在车辆路径问题中超越通用大模型和专家设计的启发式方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战当前依赖大规模通用模型（如GPT-4）的范式，证明小规模专用LLM通过精细调优可以生成更优的启发式组件。

Method: 提出RFTHGS框架，结合强化学习和课程学习，逐步训练LLM生成高性能交叉算子，并引入缓存机制避免抄袭。

Result: 实验表明，该方法生成的算子显著优于专家设计和现有基线，且能泛化到大规模问题（1000节点）。

Conclusion: 专用小规模LLM通过精细调优，在特定任务中可超越通用大模型和人工设计，为启发式设计提供新方向。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automated
heuristic designers for vehicle routing problems (VRPs), current
state-of-the-art methods predominantly rely on prompting massive,
general-purpose models like GPT-4. This work challenges that paradigm by
demonstrating that a smaller, specialized LLM, when meticulously fine-tuned,
can generate components that surpass expert-crafted heuristics within advanced
solvers. We propose RFTHGS, a novel Reinforcement learning (RL) framework for
Fine-Tuning a small LLM to generate high-performance crossover operators for
the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS) solver, applied to the Capacitated VRP (CVRP).
Our method employs a multi-tiered, curriculum-based reward function that
progressively guides the LLM to master generating first compilable, then
executable, and finally, superior-performing operators that exceed human expert
designs. This is coupled with an operator caching mechanism that discourages
plagiarism and promotes diversity during training. Comprehensive experiments
show that our fine-tuned LLM produces crossover operators which significantly
outperform the expert-designed ones in HGS. The performance advantage remains
consistent, generalizing from small-scale instances to large-scale problems
with up to 1000 nodes. Furthermore, RFTHGS exceeds the performance of leading
neuro-combinatorial baselines, prompt-based methods, and commercial LLMs such
as GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热成像面部标志检测在复杂光照条件下至关重要，但缺乏丰富的视觉线索，现有方法计算成本高或引入结构伪影。

Method: 采用多级跨模态知识蒸馏（MLCM-KD）和双向注入知识蒸馏（DIKD），通过闭环监督学习模态不变特征。

Result: 在公开的热成像面部标志检测基准测试中表现优异，显著超越现有方法并大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: MLCM-KD框架通过双向知识蒸馏有效解决了模态差异问题，为热成像面部标志检测提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial Landmark Detection (FLD) in thermal imagery is critical for
applications in challenging lighting conditions, but it is hampered by the lack
of rich visual cues. Conventional cross-modal solutions, like feature fusion or
image translation from RGB data, are often computationally expensive or
introduce structural artifacts, limiting their practical deployment. To address
this, we propose Multi-Level Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation (MLCM-KD), a
novel framework that decouples high-fidelity RGB-to-thermal knowledge transfer
from model compression to create both accurate and efficient thermal FLD
models. A central challenge during knowledge transfer is the profound modality
gap between RGB and thermal data, where traditional unidirectional distillation
fails to enforce semantic consistency across disparate feature spaces. To
overcome this, we introduce Dual-Injected Knowledge Distillation (DIKD), a
bidirectional mechanism designed specifically for this task. DIKD establishes a
connection between modalities: it not only guides the thermal student with rich
RGB features but also validates the student's learned representations by
feeding them back into the frozen teacher's prediction head. This closed-loop
supervision forces the student to learn modality-invariant features that are
semantically aligned with the teacher, ensuring a robust and profound knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on
public thermal FLD benchmarks, notably outperforming previous methods while
drastically reducing computational overhead.

Result: TACT在真实分布偏移基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TACT通过因果修剪有效提升模型鲁棒性，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation aims to improve model robustness under distribution
shifts by adapting models with access to unlabeled target samples. A primary
cause of performance degradation under such shifts is the model's reliance on
features that lack a direct causal relationship with the prediction target. We
introduce Test-time Adaptation by Causal Trimming (TACT), a method that
identifies and removes non-causal components from representations for test
distributions. TACT applies data augmentations that preserve causal features
while varying non-causal ones. By analyzing the changes in the representations
using Principal Component Analysis, TACT identifies the highest variance
directions associated with non-causal features. It trims the representations by
removing their projections on the identified directions, and uses the trimmed
representations for the predictions. During adaptation, TACT continuously
tracks and refines these directions to get a better estimate of non-causal
features. We theoretically analyze the effectiveness of this approach and
empirically validate TACT on real-world out-of-distribution benchmarks. TACT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin.

Conclusion: 该方法在多核测试中有效平衡了多样性和性能，具有理论和实际优势。

Abstract: To adapt kernel two-sample and independence testing to complex structured
data, aggregation of multiple kernels is frequently employed to boost testing
power compared to single-kernel tests. However, we observe a phenomenon that
directly maximizing multiple kernel-based statistics may result in highly
similar kernels that capture highly overlapping information, limiting the
effectiveness of aggregation. To address this, we propose an aggregated
statistic that explicitly incorporates kernel diversity based on the covariance
between different kernels. Moreover, we identify a fundamental challenge: a
trade-off between the diversity among kernels and the test power of individual
kernels, i.e., the selected kernels should be both effective and diverse. This
motivates a testing framework with selection inference, which leverages
information from the training phase to select kernels with strong individual
performance from the learned diverse kernel pool. We provide rigorous
theoretical statements and proofs to show the consistency on the test power and
control of Type-I error, along with asymptotic analysis of the proposed
statistics. Lastly, we conducted extensive empirical experiments demonstrating
the superior performance of our proposed approach across various benchmarks for
both two-sample and independence testing.

Conclusion: 建议根据数据复杂度选择模型：LSTM用于复杂模式，Informer用于高效部署，经典方法用于简单周期数据。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for modern digital infrastructures,
yet existing methods lack systematic cross-domain evaluation. We present a
comprehensive forecasting-based framework unifying classical methods
(Holt-Winters, SARIMA) with deep learning architectures (LSTM, Informer) under
a common residual-based detection interface. Our modular pipeline integrates
preprocessing (normalization, STL decomposition), four forecasting models, four
detection methods, and dual evaluation through forecasting metrics (MAE, RMSE,
PCC) and detection metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, AUC). We conduct the first
complete evaluation on the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (58 datasets, 7
categories) with 232 model training runs and 464 detection evaluations
achieving 100\% success rate. LSTM achieves best performance (F1: 0.688,
ranking first or second on 81\% of datasets) with exceptional correlation on
complex patterns (PCC: 0.999). Informer provides competitive accuracy (F1:
0.683) with 30\% faster training. Classical methods achieve perfect predictions
on simple synthetic data with 60 lower cost but show 2-3 worse F1-scores on
real-world datasets. Forecasting quality dominates detection performance:
differences between detection methods (F1: 0.621-0.688) are smaller than
between forecasting models (F1: 0.344-0.688). Our findings provide
evidence-based guidance: use LSTM for complex patterns, Informer for
efficiency-critical deployments, and classical methods for simple periodic data
with resource constraints. The complete implementation and results establish
baselines for future forecasting-based anomaly detection research.

Conclusion: 学习算法是计算策略的主要决定因素，RL能自主发现复杂动态机制，为设计自适应AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that
emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine
intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role
of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains
largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and
supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward
fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical
decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal
that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining
stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic
attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,
which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We
further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a
powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that
enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous
solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex
dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and
correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity
increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary
determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization
autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less
accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both
mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for
designing adaptive AI systems.

Abstract: The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in real-world and high-risk
applications has intensified the discussion about their trustworthiness and
ethical usage, from both a technical and a legislative perspective. The field
of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) addresses this challenge by
proposing explanations that bring to light the decision-making processes of
complex black-box models. Despite being an essential property, the robustness
of explanations is often an overlooked aspect during development: only robust
explanation methods can increase the trust in the system as a whole. This paper
investigates the role of robustness through the usage of a feature importance
aggregation derived from multiple models ($k$-nearest neighbours, random forest
and neural networks). Preliminary results showcase the potential in increasing
the trustworthiness of the application, while leveraging multiple model's
predictive power.

TL;DR: ELMO提出了一种纯低精度训练框架，用于极端多标签分类（XMC），使用BFloat16和Float8数据类型，显著减少GPU内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有XMC方法依赖FP16-FP32混合精度训练，存在不稳定性和内存效率低的问题。

Method: 利用Kahan求和和随机舍入，在Float8中训练XMC模型，无需单精度主权重或张量缩放，并结合梯度融合和分块优化内存。

Result: 在300万标签的XMC模型中，仅需6.6 GiB GPU内存，优于优化SOTA方法的39.7 GiB，且不损失精度。

Conclusion: ELMO证明了纯低精度训练在XMC中的可行性，显著降低了内存需求。

Abstract: Large output spaces, also referred to as Extreme multilabel classification
(XMC), is a setting that arises, e.g., in large-scale tagging and
product-to-product recommendation, and is characterized by the number of labels
ranging from hundreds of thousands to millions. This means that the linear
classification head, usually only a tiny fraction of the overall model, turns
into the main driver for compute and memory demand. Current state-of-the-art
XMC methods predominantly rely on FP16-FP32 mixed-precision training, which we
show can be unstable, and inefficient in terms of memory usage and
computational overhead. Meanwhile, existing low-precision methods typically
retain higher precision for the classification layer. In this work, we propose
ELMO, a pure low-precision training framework for XMC models using BFloat16 and
Float8 data types. By leveraging Kahan summation and stochastic rounding, we
demonstrate that XMC models can be effectively trained entirely in Float8,
without relying on single-precision master weights or tensor scaling.
Low-precision training, combined with our proposed memory optimizations --
gradient fusion and chunking -- enables significant reductions in GPU memory
usage. For example, we train a 3-million-label XMC model with only 6.6 GiB of
GPU memory, compared to the 39.7 GiB required by the optimized SOTA method,
Renee without compromising accuracy.

Result: 在AIME 2025等复杂推理任务中，EAGer显著减少计算量并提升性能。

Conclusion: EAGer在无目标标签时优化效率-性能权衡，有标签时显著节省计算并提升性能。

Abstract: With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,
however, allocates the same compute budget for each prompt. Grounded on the
assumption that different prompts carry different degrees of complexity, and
thus different computation needs, we propose EAGer, a training-free generation
method that leverages model uncertainty through token-wise entropy distribution
to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the
instances where exploration of alternative paths is most needed. We find that
across multiple open-source models on complex reasoning benchmarks such as AIME
2025, EAGer can reallocate the budget without accessing target labels,
achieving the best efficiency-performance trade-off in terms of reasoning
length and Pass@k. When target labels are accessible, EAGer generates up to 65%
fewer tokens (hence saving compute) and achieves up to 37% improvement in
Pass@k compared to the Full Parallel Sampling.

Conclusion: TGRL框架展示了工具强化学习在LLM推理中的跨领域潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in reasoning and tool utilization. However, the generalization of
tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) across diverse domains remains
underexplored. In this work, we investigate the cross-domain generalization of
an LLM agent equipped with a code interpreter tool, which is exclusively
trained on mathematical problem-solving tasks. Despite the restricted training
domain, we evaluate the agent's performance across several distinct reasoning
domains. The results reveal that RL-based tool usage learned from mathematical
tasks can be effectively transferred to complex tasks in other domains,
enabling great task performance and high token efficiency. To facilitate this
cross-domain transfer, we propose a Tool Generalization Reinforcement Learning
(TGRL) framework designed to promote domain-agnostic learning and skill
migration, encompassing: (i) a standardized tool interface that abstracts
domain-specific nuances through consistent formatting and explicit termination,
fostering transferable invocation patterns; (ii) a dual-component reward system
that decomposes rewards to incentivize generalizable behaviors like tool
efficiency and reasoning abstraction, ensuring alignment and robustness across
domain shifts; and (iii) an XML-based prompt template that separates thinking,
tool calls, and responses to encourage modular, domain-invariant planning and
coherent multi-turn interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks validate our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance and
highlighting the cross-domain potential of Tool RL for LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Deciphering the function of unseen protein sequences is a fundamental
challenge with broad scientific impact, yet most existing methods depend on
task-specific adapters or large-scale supervised fine-tuning. We introduce the
"Protein-as-Second-Language" framework, which reformulates amino-acid sequences
as sentences in a novel symbolic language that large language models can
interpret through contextual exemplars. Our approach adaptively constructs
sequence-question-answer triples that reveal functional cues in a zero-shot
setting, without any further training. To support this process, we curate a
bilingual corpus of 79,926 protein-QA instances spanning attribute prediction,
descriptive understanding, and extended reasoning. Empirically, our method
delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned
protein-specific language models. These results highlight that generic LLMs,
when guided with protein-as-language cues, can outperform domain-specialized
models, offering a scalable pathway for protein understanding in foundation
models.

Motivation: 现有机器学习漏洞检测模型只能标记整个函数为漏洞，无法精确定位具体代码行，且忽视了数据中的虚假相关性和偏见。

Method: 提出Detection Alignment（DA）方法，通过比较模型预测的关键代码行与真实漏洞位置的一致性来评估模型。

Result: 分析表明，现有模型的预测常受非漏洞代码行的偏见影响。

Conclusion: DA方法揭示了漏洞检测模型中的偏见问题，为改进模型提供了方向。

Abstract: To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system
security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their
now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to
flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than
precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection
granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development,
ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug,
evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent
work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus
narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more
fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the
presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often
predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we
investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an
explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection
Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines
that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the
vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and
adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze
multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we
show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by
non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and
spurious correlations. The code is available at

Conclusion: ProjNet能够高效处理大规模输入，并在多种问题设置中表现出色。

Abstract: Many machine learning applications require outputs that satisfy complex,
dynamic constraints. This task is particularly challenging in Graph Neural
Network models due to the variable output sizes of graph-structured data. In
this paper, we introduce ProjNet, a Graph Neural Network framework which
satisfies input-dependant constraints. ProjNet combines a sparse vector
clipping method with the Component-Averaged Dykstra (CAD) algorithm, an
iterative scheme for solving the best-approximation problem. We establish a
convergence result for CAD and develop a GPU-accelerated implementation capable
of handling large-scale inputs efficiently. To enable end-to-end training, we
introduce a surrogate gradient for CAD that is both computationally efficient
and better suited for optimization than the exact gradient. We validate ProjNet
on four classes of constrained optimisation problems: linear programming, two
classes of non-convex quadratic programs, and radio transmit power
optimization, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse problem settings.

### [414] [Neural Weight Compression for Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11234)
*Jegwang Ryu,Minkyu Kim,Seungjun Shin,Hee Min Choi,Dokwan Oh,Jaeho Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Neural Weight Compression（NWC）的神经网络编解码器，用于高效压缩语言模型权重，解决了传统压缩方法在权重数据上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型规模和应用的增加，其权重的存储和传输效率变得至关重要。然而，由于对权重数据模态的理解有限，传统压缩方法依赖手动试错，效果不佳。

Method: 提出基于自动编码器的NWC框架，包含三个关键技术：列向张量分块与归一化、重要性感知训练损失、基于模型输出的推理时误差补偿机制。

Result: 在开放权重语言模型上的实验表明，NWC在4-6位精度下实现了与FP16模型几乎相当的准确性，压缩效果达到竞争或领先水平。

Conclusion: NWC为语言模型权重压缩提供了一种高效且自动化的解决方案，显著提升了压缩效率与模型性能的平衡。

Abstract: The efficient storage and transmission of language model weights is becoming
increasingly important, as their scale and adoption continue to grow. However,
as our understanding of this new data modality is limited, designing a good
compression algorithm for language model weights heavily relies on manual,
trial-and-error approaches. In this paper, we propose a learned compression
framework that trains neural codecs directly from pretrained language model
weights. Unlike conventional data (e.g., images), language model weights pose
unique challenges: the sizes and shapes of weight tensors vary significantly,
and the reconstruction quality must be judged by downstream model predictions
rather than na\"ive MSE loss. To address this, we introduce Neural Weight
Compression (NWC), a novel autoencoder-based neural codec tailored to model
weight compression. The proposed method inherits the advantages of
autoencoder-based codecs while incorporating three technical components: (1)
column-wise tensor chunking and normalization; (2) an importance-aware training
loss; (3) an inference-time error compensation mechanism guided by model
outputs. Experiments on open-weight language models show that NWC achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art accuracy-compression tradeoffs, with
particularly strong results at 4-6 bit precisions where accuracy remains nearly
on par with FP16 models.

Motivation: 连接图（CGs）在同步、黎曼信号处理和神经束扩散等应用中扮演关键角色，但如何从观测信号中学习CGs是一个未解决的逆问题。

Method: 基于一致性假设的最大伪似然框架，提出SCGL算法，通过黎曼流形上的块优化过程联合推断网络拓扑、边权重和几何结构。

Result: 实验表明，SCGL在拓扑恢复和几何保真度上均优于现有基线，且计算高效。

Conclusion: SCGL为学习连接图提供了一种有效且高效的方法，适用于多种应用场景。

Abstract: Connection graphs (CGs) extend traditional graph models by coupling network
topology with orthogonal transformations, enabling the representation of global
geometric consistency. They play a key role in applications such as
synchronization, Riemannian signal processing, and neural sheaf diffusion. In
this work, we address the inverse problem of learning CGs directly from
observed signals. We propose a principled framework based on maximum
pseudo-likelihood under a consistency assumption, which enforces spectral
properties linking the connection Laplacian to the underlying combinatorial
Laplacian. Based on this formulation, we introduce the Structured Connection
Graph Learning (SCGL) algorithm, a block-optimization procedure over Riemannian
manifolds that jointly infers network topology, edge weights, and geometric
structure. Our experiments show that SCGL consistently outperforms existing
baselines in both topological recovery and geometric fidelity, while remaining
computationally efficient.

Motivation: 现实图中节点常缺乏特征向量，需通过邻域连接和类标签学习有效嵌入。

Method: 联合优化无监督结构保留、监督正则化和半监督传播三个目标。

Result: 分类准确率与或优于现有方法，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: 框架高效且性能优越，适用于缺乏特征信息的图数据。

Abstract: Graph-based learning is a cornerstone for analyzing structured data, with
node classification as a central task. However, in many real-world graphs,
nodes lack informative feature vectors, leaving only neighborhood connectivity
and class labels as available signals. In such cases, effective classification
hinges on learning node embeddings that capture structural roles and
topological context. We introduce a fast semi-supervised embedding framework
that jointly optimizes three complementary objectives: (i) unsupervised
structure preservation via scalable modularity approximation, (ii) supervised
regularization to minimize intra-class variance among labeled nodes, and (iii)
semi-supervised propagation that refines unlabeled nodes through
random-walk-based label spreading with attention-weighted similarity. These
components are unified into a single iterative optimization scheme, yielding
high-quality node embeddings. On standard benchmarks, our method consistently
achieves classification accuracy at par with or superior to state-of-the-art
approaches, while requiring significantly less computational cost.

Result: 相比直接使用原始数据，该方法显著提高了平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 自监督自编码器在无标签数据可用性增加的情况下，是解决临床数据问题的有效方法。

Abstract: As clinical data are becoming increasingly available, machine learning
methods have been employed to extract knowledge from them and predict clinical
events. While promising, approaches suffer from at least two main issues: low
availability of labelled data and data heterogeneity leading to missing values.
This work proposes the use of self-supervised auto-encoders to efficiently
address these challenges. We apply our methodology to a clinical dataset from
patients with ischaemic heart disease. Patient data is embedded in a latent
space, built using unlabelled data, which is then used to train a neural
network classifier to predict cardiovascular death. Results show improved
balanced accuracy compared to applying the classifier directly to the raw data,
demonstrating that this solution is promising, especially in conditions where
availability of unlabelled data could increase.

Motivation: 在异构数据场景下，现有联邦LoRA调优技术存在客户端漂移问题，且忽视了对调优矩阵的细粒度分析。

Method: 通过分析LoRA矩阵的敏感性，分别优化A矩阵中的方向向量（编码共享知识）和B矩阵中的幅度向量（编码个性化知识），并结合全局和局部优化器进行协同优化。

Result: 在Databricks-Dolly-15k和Natural Instructions数据集上，使用LLaMA2-7B和Deepseek-7B模型，全局性能提升0.39%，本地性能提升0.59%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了异构数据场景下全局模型的泛化能力和本地模型的个性化适应能力。

Abstract: Federated efficient fine-tuning has emerged as an approach that leverages
distributed data and computational resources across nodes to address the
challenges of large-scale fine-tuning and privacy preservation. The Low-Rank
Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained
models by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,
in heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the
global model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of
individual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning
techniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address
this, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA
matrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and
magnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning
method. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,
which encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more
effectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,
by fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which
encode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized
knowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a
pipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further
improves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and
local levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model
and the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data
scenarios. Experiments on Databricks-Dolly-15k and Natural Instructions with
LLaMA2-7B and Deepseek-7B confirm that our method improves global performance
by 0.39% and local performance by 0.59%.

Result: 实验显示高SI原则提升训练稳定性和性能，信息几何分析验证了流形的结构改进。

Conclusion: ENIGMA支持推理、对齐和鲁棒性为单一信息几何目标的假设，无需奖励模型即可实现原则性推理。

Abstract: We present Entropic Mutual-Information Geometry Large-Language Model
Alignment (ENIGMA), a novel approach to Large-Language Model (LLM) training
that jointly improves reasoning, alignment and robustness by treating an
organisation's policies/principles as directions to move on a model's
information manifold. Our single-loop trainer combines Group-Relative Policy
Optimisation (GRPO), an on-policy, critic-free RL method with Chain-of-Thought
(CoT)-format only rewards; a Self-Supervised Alignment with Mutual Information
(SAMI)-style symmetric InfoNCE auxiliary; and an entropic Sinkhorn
optimal-transport regulariser on hidden-state distributions to bound geometry
drift. We also introduce infoNCE metrics that specialise to a standard MI lower
bound under matched negatives to measure how strongly a model's CoT encodes
these policies. These metrics include a Sufficiency Index (SI) that enables the
selection and creation of principles that maximise downstream performance prior
to training. In our experiments using small (1B) LLMs, high-SI principles
predict steadier training dynamics and improved benchmark performance over GRPO
ablations. Our information-geometry analysis of trained models validates
desirable structural change in the manifold. These results support our
hypothesis that reasoning, alignment, and robustness are projections of a
single informationgeometric objective, and that models trained using ENIGMA
demonstrate principled reasoning without the use of a reward model, offering a
path to trusted capability

Motivation: 解决LLMs在网格化交通数据中空间依赖性建模不足的问题。

Method: 结合Vision-LLM视觉编码器和高效数值编码方案，采用两阶段微调（SFT和GRPO）。

Result: 在长期预测和跨域少样本场景中分别提升15.6%和30.04%。

Conclusion: ST-Vision-LLM在数据稀缺环境中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across
various data-scarce environments.

environment that wraps TORAX for simulating the plasma dynamics. The objective
is formulated through rewards depending on the simulated state of the plasma
and control action to optimize specific characteristics of the plasma, such as
performance and stability. The resulting environment instance is then
compatible with a wide range of RL algorithms and libraries and will facilitate
RL research in plasma control. In its current version, one environment is
readily available, based on a ramp-up scenario of the International
Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存在自回归模型中减少冗余计算，但内存开销大，现有方法在长序列场景下存在效率和精度瓶颈。

Method: 提出基于时间局部性和语义边界的检索策略，以及针对输入和输出序列的细粒度管理方案。

Result: LouisKV在多种长序列任务中实现4.7倍加速，同时保持接近无损的精度。

Conclusion: LouisKV通过优化KV缓存检索，显著提升了长序列场景下的效率和准确性。

Abstract: While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.

Result: DiffTSST在风格迁移上表现优异，数据增强后能提升数据稀缺场景下的异常检测性能。

Conclusion: DiffTSST为时间序列风格迁移提供了有效解决方案，并在实际应用中展示了其价值。

Abstract: Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data
remain limited. We introduce DiffTSST, a diffusion-based framework that
disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further
validate its real-world utility by showing that data augmentation with DiffTSST
improves anomaly detection in data-scarce regimes.

Conclusion: EVP作为插件能显著提升现有方法利用历史事件知识的能力。

Abstract: Real-world graph typically evolve via a series of events, modeling dynamic
interactions between objects across various domains. For dynamic graph
learning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular
solutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic
graphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship
between nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events. In
this paper, we propose EVP, an event-aware dynamic graph prompt learning
framework that can serve as a plug-in to existing methods, enhancing their
ability to leverage historical events knowledge. First, we extract a series of
historical events for each node and introduce an event adaptation mechanism to
align the fine-grained characteristics of these events with downstream tasks.
Second, we propose an event aggregation mechanism to effectively integrate
historical knowledge into node representations. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on four public datasets to evaluate and analyze EVP.

Abstract: Synchronous Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training has emerged as a
crucial step for enhancing Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse
capabilities. However, many systems designed to accelerate RL post-training
still suffer from low resource utilization and limited scalability. We present
ROLL Flash, a system that extends ROLL with native support for asynchronous RL
post-training. ROLL Flash is built upon two core design principles:
fine-grained parallelism and rollout-train decoupling. Guided by these
principles, ROLL Flash provides flexible programming interfaces that enable a
fully asynchronous training architecture and support efficient rollout
mechanisms, including queue scheduling and environment-level asynchronous
execution. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that ROLL Flash significantly improves resource
utilization and scalability over synchronous RL post-training. ROLL Flash
achieves up to 2.24x speedup on RLVR tasks and 2.72x on agentic tasks, using
the same GPU budget as synchronous baselines. Furthermore, we implement several
popular off-policy algorithms and verify that asynchronous training can achieve
performance on par with synchronous training.

Motivation: 现实场景中，节点特征矩阵通常稀疏或包含敏感信息，导致性能下降和隐私风险增加。

Method: 通过将特征分为多个高斯噪声视图，独立传播信息并聚合表示，提升鲁棒性和隐私保护。

Result: 实验表明MFP在节点分类任务中优于现有方法，同时显著减少隐私泄露。

Conclusion: MFP为特征缺失或敏感的图学习领域提供了高效且隐私保护的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in node
classification tasks over relational data, yet their effectiveness often
depends on the availability of complete node features. In many real-world
scenarios, however, feature matrices are highly sparse or contain sensitive
information, leading to degraded performance and increased privacy risks.
Furthermore, direct exposure of information can result in unintended data
leakage, enabling adversaries to infer sensitive information. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Multi-view Feature Propagation (MFP) framework
that enhances node classification under feature sparsity while promoting
privacy preservation. MFP extends traditional Feature Propagation (FP) by
dividing the available features into multiple Gaussian-noised views, each
propagating information independently through the graph topology. The
aggregated representations yield expressive and robust node embeddings. This
framework is novel in two respects: it introduces a mechanism that improves
robustness under extreme sparsity, and it provides a principled way to balance
utility with privacy. Extensive experiments conducted on graph datasets
demonstrate that MFP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in node
classification while substantially reducing privacy leakage. Moreover, our
analysis demonstrates that propagated outputs serve as alternative imputations
rather than reconstructions of the original features, preserving utility
without compromising privacy. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis further
confirms the stability and practical applicability of MFP across diverse
scenarios. Overall, MFP provides an effective and privacy-aware framework for
graph learning in domains characterized by missing or sensitive features.

Result: 小批量Adam和AdamW可实现近零测试误差，而全批量版本表现较差；Adam的有效权重衰减界限更小。

Conclusion: 批量大小和权重衰减对Adam的泛化性能至关重要，Adam需要更精细的权重衰减调参。

Abstract: Adam is a popular and widely used adaptive gradient method in deep learning,
which has also received tremendous focus in theoretical research. However, most
existing theoretical work primarily analyzes its full-batch version, which
differs fundamentally from the stochastic variant used in practice. Unlike SGD,
stochastic Adam does not converge to its full-batch counterpart even with
infinitesimal learning rates. We present the first theoretical characterization
of how batch size affects Adam's generalization, analyzing two-layer
over-parameterized CNNs on image data. Our results reveal that while both Adam
and AdamW with proper weight decay $\lambda$ converge to poor test error
solutions, their mini-batch variants can achieve near-zero test error. We
further prove Adam has a strictly smaller effective weight decay bound than
AdamW, theoretically explaining why Adam requires more sensitive $\lambda$
tuning. Extensive experiments validate our findings, demonstrating the critical
role of batch size and weight decay in Adam's generalization performance.

patching. We present knowledge maps of five LLMs which show, at a
coarse-resolution, where knowledge about patient's ages, medical symptoms,
diseases and drugs is stored in the models. In particular for Llama3.3-70B, we
find that most medical knowledge is processed in the first half of the model's
layers. In addition, we find several interesting phenomena: (i) age is often
encoded in a non-linear and sometimes discontinuous manner at intermediate
layers in the models, (ii) the disease progression representation is
non-monotonic and circular at certain layers of the model, (iii) in
Llama3.3-70B, drugs cluster better by medical specialty rather than mechanism
of action, especially for Llama3.3-70B and (iv) Gemma3-27B and MedGemma-27B
have activations that collapse at intermediate layers but recover by the final
layers. These results can guide future research on fine-tuning, un-learning or
de-biasing LLMs for medical tasks by suggesting at which layers in the model
these techniques should be applied.

TL;DR: FedHybrid是一个联邦学习框架，通过混合重计算和压缩技术减少内存占用，同时保证模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动设备在联邦学习中因内存限制导致的部署难题。

Method: 联合评估设备的内存预算、计算能力和数据多样性，生成执行计划，采用激活压缩技术。

Result: 在模拟和实际移动设备上，模型精度提升39.1%，训练时间减少15.5倍。

Conclusion: FedHybrid有效解决了内存限制问题，提升了联邦学习的效率和精度。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SLR文献检索和筛选耗时且依赖人工，传统关键词搜索效率低。

Result: 在8000+论文数据集上验证，错误率低于人工标注，开源模型效果足够。

Conclusion: 人机协作可高效提升SLR流程，开源模型使其经济可行。

Abstract: The creation of systematic literature reviews (SLR) is critical for analyzing
the landscape of a research field and guiding future research directions.
However, retrieving and filtering the literature corpus for an SLR is highly
time-consuming and requires extensive manual effort, as keyword-based searches
in digital libraries often return numerous irrelevant publications. In this
work, we propose a pipeline leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs),
classifying papers based on descriptive prompts and deciding jointly using a
consensus scheme. The entire process is human-supervised and interactively
controlled via our open-source visual analytics web interface, LLMSurver, which
enables real-time inspection and modification of model outputs. We evaluate our
approach using ground-truth data from a recent SLR comprising over 8,000
candidate papers, benchmarking both open and commercial state-of-the-art LLMs
from mid-2024 and fall 2025. Results demonstrate that our pipeline
significantly reduces manual effort while achieving lower error rates than
single human annotators. Furthermore, modern open-source models prove
sufficient for this task, making the method accessible and cost-effective.
Overall, our work demonstrates how responsible human-AI collaboration can
accelerate and enhance systematic literature reviews within academic workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决三导联ECG在便携性上的优势但诊断能力不足的问题，通过生成模型弥补其空间覆盖不足的缺陷。

Method: 改进VAE架构以捕捉ECG信号的时空依赖性，并通过MSE、MAE和FID评估生成质量，专家图灵测试验证临床有效性。

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上生成生理真实且诊断信息丰富的信号，下游任务表现稳健。

Conclusion: 生成模型在ECG重建中具有潜力，为低成本、可扩展的心脏筛查提供新思路。

Abstract: Twelve-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs) are the clinical gold standard for
cardiac diagnosis, providing comprehensive spatial coverage of the heart
necessary to detect conditions such as myocardial infarction (MI). However,
their lack of portability limits continuous and large-scale use. Three-lead ECG
systems are widely used in wearable devices due to their simplicity and
mobility, but they often fail to capture pathologies in unmeasured regions. To
address this, we propose WearECG, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) method that
reconstructs twelve-lead ECGs from three leads: II, V1, and V5. Our model
includes architectural improvements to better capture temporal and spatial
dependencies in ECG signals. We evaluate generation quality using MSE, MAE, and
Frechet Inception Distance (FID), and assess clinical validity via a Turing
test with expert cardiologists. To further validate diagnostic utility, we
fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pretrained ECG model, on a multi-label
classification task involving over 40 cardiac conditions, including six
different myocardial infarction locations, using both real and generated
signals. Experiments on the MIMIC dataset show that our method produces
physiologically realistic and diagnostically informative signals, with robust
performance in downstream tasks. This work demonstrates the potential of
generative modeling for ECG reconstruction and its implications for scalable,
low-cost cardiac screening.

Result: 框架为通用任务适应提供了可扩展的基础。

Conclusion: 迭代摊销推理结合了优化和摊销学习，解决了当前方法的扩展性问题。

Abstract: Modern learning systems increasingly rely on amortized learning - the idea of
reusing computation or inductive biases shared across tasks to enable rapid
generalization to novel problems. This principle spans a range of approaches,
including meta-learning, in-context learning, prompt tuning, learned optimizers
and more. While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they
encode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context
examples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such
methods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as
initializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they
incorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes
amortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on
whether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.
Building on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most
methods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process
task data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address
this, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine
solutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic
optimization. Our formulation bridges optimization-based meta-learning with
forward-pass amortization in models like LLMs, offering a scalable and
extensible foundation for general-purpose task adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Top-K操作符不可微分，阻碍端到端训练，且现有方法存在目标不一致或计算复杂度高的问题。

Method: 通过放松归一化约束，DFTopK获得闭式解，避免排序，实现线性时间复杂度。

Result: 在RecFLow基准和工业系统中，DFTopK显著提升训练效率并实现更优性能，线上A/B测试带来1.77%的收入提升。

Conclusion: DFTopK首次将可微分Top-K操作符引入推荐系统，并实现理论最优的线性时间复杂度。

Abstract: Cascade ranking is a widely adopted paradigm in large-scale information
retrieval systems for Top-K item selection. However, the Top-K operator is
non-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include
Learning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics
like NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable
sorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for
direct Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix
aggregation. A promising alternative is to directly construct a differentiable
approximation of the Top-K selection operator, bypassing the use of soft
permutation matrices. However, even state-of-the-art differentiable Top-K
operator (e.g., LapSum) require $O(n \log n)$ complexity due to their
dependence on sorting for solving the threshold. Thus, we propose DFTopK, a
novel differentiable Top-K operator achieving optimal $O(n)$ time complexity.
By relaxing normalization constraints, DFTopK admits a closed-form solution and
avoids sorting. DFTopK also avoids the gradient conflicts inherent in
differentiable sorting-based methods. We evaluate DFTopK on both the public
benchmark RecFLow and an industrial system. Experimental results show that
DFTopK significantly improves training efficiency while achieving superior
performance, which enables us to scale up training samples more efficiently. In
the online A/B test, DFTopK yielded a +1.77\% revenue lift with the same
computational budget compared to the baseline. To the best of our knowledge,
this work is the first to introduce differentiable Top-K operators into
recommendation systems and the first to achieve theoretically optimal
linear-time complexity for Top-K selection. We have open-sourced our
implementation to facilitate future research in both academia and industry.

Motivation: 整数缩放是整数AI推理中的硬件高成本操作，现有方法（如QAT）未充分解决其影响。

Method: 提出后训练强量化缩放乘数的方法，并引入Rescale-Aware Training微调技术。

Result: 实验显示，即使缩放器宽度减少8倍，仍能通过少量增量训练保持模型精度。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的嵌入式系统提供了更高效、低成本的AI推理方案。

Abstract: Integer AI inference significantly reduces computational complexity in
embedded systems. Quantization-aware training (QAT) helps mitigate accuracy
degradation associated with post-training quantization but still overlooks the
impact of integer rescaling during inference, which is a hardware costly
operation in integer-only AI inference. This work shows that rescaling cost can
be dramatically reduced post-training, by applying a stronger quantization to
the rescale multiplicands at no model-quality loss. Furthermore, we introduce
Rescale-Aware Training, a fine tuning method for ultra-low bit-width rescaling
multiplicands. Experiments show that even with 8x reduced rescaler widths, the
full accuracy is preserved through minimal incremental retraining. This enables
more energy-efficient and cost-efficient AI inference for resource-constrained
embedded systems.

Motivation: 探索强化学习如何优化大型语言模型在推理任务中的表现，尤其是在处理长序列和罕见任务时的优势。

Method: 提出理论框架，分析强化学习在混合分布（短和长链式思维序列）中的优化机制，并通过线性模型和Llama系列模型进行验证。

Conclusion: 强化学习显著提升语言模型在复杂推理任务中的表现，尤其是在处理罕见或长序列任务时。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.

Conclusion: ReLook展示了感知代理、视觉奖励和训练-推理解耦的优势。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they
struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered
pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded
reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust
generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool.
During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual
critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable,
vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors
renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we
introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only
improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference,
we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,
keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.
Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong
baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the
benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference
decoupling.

Conclusion: GTPs通过统一ODE视角，为离线RL提供了更通用的生成策略范式，解决了速度与性能的权衡问题。

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as a powerful class of policies for offline
reinforcement learning (RL) due to their ability to capture complex,
multi-modal behaviors. However, existing methods face a stark trade-off: slow,
iterative models like diffusion policies are computationally expensive, while
fast, single-step models like consistency policies often suffer from degraded
performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to bridge this
gap. The key to moving beyond the limitations of individual methods, we argue,
lies in a unifying perspective that views modern generative models, including
diffusion, flow matching, and consistency models, as specific instances of
learning a continuous-time generative trajectory governed by an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE). This principled foundation provides a clearer
design space for generative policies in RL and allows us to propose Generative
Trajectory Policies (GTPs), a new and more general policy paradigm that learns
the entire solution map of the underlying ODE. To make this paradigm practical
for offline RL, we further introduce two key theoretically principled
adaptations. Empirical results demonstrate that GTP achieves state-of-the-art
performance on D4RL benchmarks - it significantly outperforms prior generative
policies, achieving perfect scores on several notoriously hard AntMaze tasks.

Result: 在三个教育任务中，MISTAKE在模拟学生错误答案、推断潜在误解和生成错误答案方面表现更优。

Conclusion: MISTAKE方法在教育应用中有效提升了错误推理模式的建模能力。

Abstract: Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).

Conclusion: 知识引导的机器学习方法显著提升了ET估算精度，为农业和水资源管理提供了高分辨率的数据支持。

Abstract: Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a critical role in the land-atmosphere
interactions, yet its accurate quantification across various spatiotemporal
scales remains a challenge. In situ measurement approaches, like eddy
covariance (EC) or weather station-based ET estimation, allow for measuring ET
at a single location. Agricultural uses of ET require estimates for each field
over broad areas, making it infeasible to deploy sensing systems at each
location. This study integrates tree-based and knowledge-guided machine
learning (ML) techniques with multispectral remote sensing data, griddled
meteorology and EC data to upscale ET across the Midwest United States. We
compare four tree-based models - Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, LightGBM -
and a simple feed-forward artificial neural network in combination with
features engineered using knowledge-guided ML principles. Models were trained
and tested on EC towers located in the Midwest of the United States using
k-fold cross validation with k=5 and site-year, biome stratified train-test
split to avoid data leakage. Results show that LightGBM with knowledge-guided
features outperformed other methods with an R2=0.86, MSE=14.99 W m^-2 and MAE =
8.82 W m^-2 according to grouped k-fold validation (k=5). Feature importance
analysis shows that knowledge-guided features were most important for
predicting evapotranspiration. Using the best performing model, we provide a
data product at 500 m spatial and one-day temporal resolution for gridded ET
for the period of 2019-2024. Intercomparison between the new gridded product
and state-level weather station-based ET estimates show best-in-class
correspondence.

Result: 实验表明，该框架在多跳场景中表现优异，高跳问题性能提升达33.8%。

Conclusion: 提出的QSGNN框架有效解决了多跳问题检索中的挑战，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has demonstrated its ability to enhance
Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources.
However, multi-hop questions, which require the identification of multiple
knowledge targets to form a synthesized answer, raise new challenges for RAG
systems. Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully
understand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible
to irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning
framework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a
Multi-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various
information levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop
questions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network
(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs
intra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the
information aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates
multi-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the
impact of noise. To enhance its ability to learn robust representations, we
further propose two synthesized data generation strategies for pre-training the
QSGNN. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in multi-hop scenarios, especially in high-hop questions the
improvement can reach 33.8\%. The code is available at:

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) integrates predictive modeling and
optimization by training predictors to optimize the downstream decision target
rather than merely minimizing prediction error. To date, existing DFL methods
typically rely on deterministic point predictions, which are often insufficient
to capture the intrinsic stochasticity of real-world environments. To address
this challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains
a diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and
optimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn
from the diffusion model. Our contributions are twofold. First, we formulate
diffusion DFL using the reparameterization trick, enabling end-to-end training
through diffusion. While effective, it is memory and compute-intensive due to
the need to differentiate through the diffusion sampling process. Second, we
propose a lightweight score function estimator that uses only several forward
diffusion passes and avoids backpropagation through the sampling. This follows
from our results that backpropagating through stochastic optimization can be
approximated by a weighted score function formulation. We empirically show that
our diffusion DFL approach consistently outperforms strong baselines in
decision quality. The source code for all experiments is available at the
project repository: https://github.com/GT-KOALA/Diffusion_DFL.

Abstract: Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.

TL;DR: 论文指出现有RL微调方法在数学推理任务中仅优化已有模式，而非发现新能力，并提出了新基准MATH-B以推动更深入的RL探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法在数学推理任务中仅优化已有模式，未能实现真正的探索和新技能获取，需要更难的基准来推动进步。

Method: 作者构建了MATH-B基准，旨在击败常见开源模型，并通过RL微调验证其难度。

Result: 现有RL微调模型在MATH-B上表现不佳，表明其无法应对更难的数学推理任务。

Conclusion: MATH-B有望推动探索驱动的RL方法，激发更深层次的推理能力。

Abstract: With the advent of DeepSeek-R1, a new wave of reinforcement learning (RL)
methods has emerged that seem to unlock stronger mathematical reasoning.
However, a closer look at the open-source ecosystem reveals a critical
limitation: with sufficiently many draws (e.g., $\texttt{pass@1024}$), many
existing base models already solve nearly all questions on widely used math
benchmarks such as MATH-500 and AIME 2024. This suggests that the RL
fine-tuning methods prevalent in the LLM reasoning literature largely sharpen
existing solution modes rather than discovering entirely new ones. Such
sharpening stands in contrast to the broader promise of RL: to foster
exploration and to acquire new skills. To move beyond this plateau, we
introduce MATH-Beyond (MATH-B), a benchmark deliberately constructed to defeat
common open-source models of up to 8B parameters even under large sampling
budgets. Improving performance on our benchmark via RL requires methods that
learn to reason in ways that go beyond base model capabilities in repeated
sampling. Since the problems are drawn from subsets of DAPO-Math-17K and
DeepScaleR datasets, they remain topically equivalent to standard high-school
math. Validating our premise, RL fine-tuned models such as
Nemotron-Research-Reasoning-Qwen-1.5B and DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview perform
poorly on MATH-B at $\texttt{pass@1024}$, showing how existing approaches fall
short on tackling harder instances. We hope MATH-B will catalyze
exploration-driven RL approaches that elicit deeper reasoning capabilities. We
release MATH-B at https://huggingface.co/datasets/brendel-group/MATH-Beyond.

TL;DR: 论文研究了动态测度传输在生成模型中的应用，重点分析了由随机过程诱导的流，这些流连接了指定的源分布和目标分布。通过条件期望定义的ODE流图实现了所需的传输，并探讨了哪些过程会产生直线流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是理解哪些随机过程能够产生直线流（即点加速度为零的流），从而使得流更容易通过一阶方法精确积分。

Method: 方法包括通过PDE（偏微分方程）表征直线性，分析条件加速度与加权协方差张量的散度之间的平衡，并完全描述了仿射时间插值。

Result: 结果表明，直线性仅在确定性端点耦合下发生，并推导了一般过程的流几何约束条件。

Conclusion: 结论为设计更易积分的传输提供了广泛指导，特别是在生成模型中优化流的结构。

Abstract: We study dynamic measure transport for generative modeling: specifically,
flows induced by stochastic processes that bridge a specified source and target
distribution. The conditional expectation of the process' velocity defines an
ODE whose flow map achieves the desired transport. We ask \emph{which processes
produce straight-line flows} -- i.e., flows whose pointwise acceleration
vanishes and thus are exactly integrable with a first-order method? We provide
a concise PDE characterization of straightness as a balance between conditional
acceleration and the divergence of a weighted covariance (Reynolds) tensor.
Using this lens, we fully characterize affine-in-time interpolants and show
that straightness occurs exactly under deterministic endpoint couplings. We
also derive necessary conditions that constrain flow geometry for general
processes, offering broad guidance for designing transports that are easier to
integrate.

Conclusion: 该框架为研究者提供了易于使用且无前瞻偏差的生成式AI工具。

Abstract: We introduce a family of chronologically consistent, instruction-following
large language models to eliminate lookahead bias. Each model is trained only
on data available before a clearly defined knowledge-cutoff date, ensuring
strict temporal separation from any post-cutoff data. The resulting framework
offers (i) a simple, conversational chat interface, (ii) fully open, fixed
model weights that guarantee replicability, and (iii) a conservative lower
bound on forecast accuracy, isolating the share of predictability that survives
once training leakage is removed. Together, these features provide researchers
with an easy-to-use generative AI tool useful for a wide range of prediction
tasks that is free of lookahead bias.

TL;DR: BGPO是一种内存高效的强化学习算法，通过优化ELBO下界来解决dLLMs中RL目标的内存和计算问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于dLLMs的似然函数难以处理，现有方法在RL训练中需要保留大量计算图，导致内存开销大且样本量受限。

Method: BGPO通过设计一个线性且等价于ELBO目标的下界，实现梯度累积和恒定内存使用。

Result: 实验表明，BGPO在数学问题解决、代码生成和规划任务中显著优于现有RL算法。

Conclusion: BGPO通过优化下界设计，解决了内存和计算效率问题，提升了RL在dLLMs中的性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to diffusion large
language models (dLLMs) lies in the intractability of their likelihood
functions, which are essential for the RL objective, necessitating
corresponding approximation in each training step. While existing methods
approximate the log-likelihoods by their evidence lower bounds (ELBOs) via
customized Monte Carlo (MC) sampling, the forward computational graphs of all
MC samples need to be retained for the gradient computation of non-linear terms
in the RL objective, resulting in significant memory overhead. This constraint
restricts feasible sample sizes, leading to imprecise likelihood approximations
and ultimately distorting the RL objective. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \emph{Boundary-Guided Policy Optimization} (BGPO), a memory-efficient
RL algorithm that maximizes a specially constructed lower bound of the
ELBO-based objective. This lower bound is carefully designed to satisfy two key
properties: (1) Linearity: it is formulated in a linear sum where each term
depends only on a single MC sample, thereby enabling gradient accumulation
across samples and ensuring constant memory usage; (2) Equivalence: Both the
value and gradient of this lower bound are equal to those of the ELBO-based
objective in on-policy training, making it also an effective approximation for
the original RL objective. These properties allow BGPO to adopt a large MC
sample size, resulting in more accurate likelihood approximations and improved
RL objective estimation, which in turn leads to enhanced performance.
Experiments show that BGPO significantly outperforms previous RL algorithms for
dLLMs in math problem solving, code generation, and planning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了强化学习中刻意探索的价值，发现基于预训练模型隐藏状态的多样性奖励能显著提升多样性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨当前强化学习技术是否能促进新行为的发现，而不仅仅是优化已有行为。

Method: 采用基于预训练语言模型隐藏状态的简单、原则性多样性奖励进行探索。

Result: 在推理和训练后阶段均显著提升多样性和pass@k率，例如在Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct上验证效率提升50%以上。

Conclusion: 刻意探索结合正确的多样性定义是发现新行为的实用路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to expand the capabilities of language
models, but it is unclear if current RL techniques promote the discovery of
novel behaviors, or simply sharpen those already present in the base model. In
this paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly
incentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to
understand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our
main finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,
representation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden
states significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for
post-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For
inference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves
efficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and
reasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%
improvement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks. For post-training, we
show that integrating this exploration strategy into an RL pipeline improves
reasoning performance over that of the initial model and over standard RL
post-training. For example, on AIME 2024, our post-trained
Qwen-2.5-7b-Instruct's pass@80 matches the pass@256 of GRPO on the same model,
demonstrating a 3x improvement in test-time sample efficiency. Overall, our
findings suggest that deliberate exploration -- with the right notion of
diversity -- is a practical path toward discovery of new behaviors beyond
sharpening.

TL;DR: 乐观Hedge在两人零和博弈中表现出色，其社会和个人遗憾上界为$O(\log(mn))$。研究优化了上界至$O(\sqrt{\log m \log n})$，并证明其最优性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨乐观Hedge在强非耦合学习动态中的遗憾依赖$m$和$n$的最优性。

Method: 通过优化学习率和负项系数，改进遗憾分析，并提供算法依赖的下界。

Result: 社会和个人遗憾上界改进至$O(\sqrt{\log m \log n})$，且上下界匹配。

Conclusion: 乐观Hedge的遗憾依赖$m$和$n$已达到最优，并改进了动态遗憾和末次迭代收敛率。

Abstract: In two-player zero-sum games, the learning dynamic based on optimistic Hedge
achieves one of the best-known regret upper bounds among strongly-uncoupled
learning dynamics. With an appropriately chosen learning rate, the social and
individual regrets can be bounded by $O(\log(mn))$ in terms of the numbers of
actions $m$ and $n$ of the two players. This study investigates the optimality
of the dependence on $m$ and $n$ in the regret of optimistic Hedge. To this
end, we begin by refining existing regret analysis and show that, in the
strongly-uncoupled setting where the opponent's number of actions is known,
both the social and individual regret bounds can be improved to $O(\sqrt{\log m
\log n})$. In this analysis, we express the regret upper bound as an
optimization problem with respect to the learning rates and the coefficients of
certain negative terms, enabling refined analysis of the leading constants. We
then show that the existing social regret bound as well as these new social and
individual regret upper bounds cannot be further improved for optimistic Hedge
by providing algorithm-dependent individual regret lower bounds. Importantly,
these social regret upper and lower bounds match exactly including the constant
factor in the leading term. Finally, building on these results, we improve the
last-iterate convergence rate and the dynamic regret of a learning dynamic
based on optimistic Hedge, and complement these bounds with algorithm-dependent
dynamic regret lower bounds that match the improved bounds.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习对LLM的推理能力至关重要，但其资源消耗大，需要大量GPU内存和长时间的训练。QeRL旨在解决这些问题。

Method: QeRL结合NVFP4量化和LoRA技术，并引入自适应量化噪声（AQN）机制，动态调整训练中的噪声以优化探索。

Result: 实验表明，QeRL在训练速度上提升1.5倍，首次实现32B LLM在单块H100 80GB GPU上的训练，并在数学基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: QeRL是一个高效且有效的LLM强化学习框架，显著提升了训练速度和性能。

Abstract: We propose QeRL, a Quantization-enhanced Reinforcement Learning framework for
large language models (LLMs). While RL is essential for LLMs' reasoning
capabilities, it is resource-intensive, requiring substantial GPU memory and
long rollout durations. QeRL addresses these issues by combining NVFP4
quantization with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), accelerating rollout phase of RL
while reducing memory overhead. Beyond efficiency, our findings show that
quantization noise increases policy entropy, enhancing exploration, and
enabling the discovery of better strategies during RL. To further optimize
exploration, QeRL introduces an Adaptive Quantization Noise (AQN) mechanism,
which dynamically adjusts noise during training. Experiments demonstrate that
QeRL delivers over 1.5 times speedup in the rollout phase. Moreover, this is
the first framework to enable RL training of a 32B LLM on a single H100 80GB
GPU, while delivering overall speedups for RL training. It also achieves faster
reward growth and higher final accuracy than 16-bit LoRA and QLoRA, while
matching the performance of full-parameter fine-tuning on mathematical
benchmarks such as GSM8K (90.8%) and MATH 500 (77.4%) in the 7B model. These
results establish QeRL as an efficient and effective framework for RL training
in LLMs.

Motivation: 探讨对抗样本的根源，挑战传统观点（决策景观不规则或非鲁棒特征敏感性），提出信息编码机制的解释。

Method: 通过叠加特征的理论分析和实验验证（合成设置和ViT模型在CIFAR-10上的测试）。

Result: 对抗扰动利用叠加特征的干扰，攻击模式可预测；叠加足以导致脆弱性，且在真实模型中持续存在。

Conclusion: 对抗脆弱性是网络表示压缩的副产品，而非学习过程缺陷或输入问题。

Abstract: Fundamental questions remain about when and why adversarial examples arise in
neural networks, with competing views characterising them either as artifacts
of the irregularities in the decision landscape or as products of sensitivity
to non-robust input features. In this paper, we instead argue that adversarial
vulnerability can stem from efficient information encoding in neural networks.
Specifically, we show how superposition - where networks represent more
features than they have dimensions - creates arrangements of latent
representations that adversaries can exploit. We demonstrate that adversarial
perturbations leverage interference between superposed features, making attack
patterns predictable from feature arrangements. Our framework provides a
mechanistic explanation for two known phenomena: adversarial attack
transferability between models with similar training regimes and class-specific
vulnerability patterns. In synthetic settings with precisely controlled
superposition, we establish that superposition suffices to create adversarial
vulnerability. We then demonstrate that these findings persist in a ViT trained
on CIFAR-10. These findings reveal adversarial vulnerability can be a byproduct
of networks' representational compression, rather than flaws in the learning
process or non-robust inputs.

Result: 在合成多模态目标和Boltzmann分布上，相比传统方法，提高了分布近似精度和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 该方法在采样效率和稳定性上优于现有摊销和蒙特卡洛方法。

Abstract: This paper proposes a synergy of amortised and particle-based methods for
sampling from distributions defined by unnormalised density functions. We state
a connection between sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and neural sequential
samplers trained by maximum-entropy reinforcement learning (MaxEnt RL), wherein
learnt sampling policies and value functions define proposal kernels and twist
functions. Exploiting this connection, we introduce an off-policy RL training
procedure for the sampler that uses samples from SMC -- using the learnt
sampler as a proposal -- as a behaviour policy that better explores the target
distribution. We describe techniques for stable joint training of proposals and
twist functions and an adaptive weight tempering scheme to reduce training
signal variance. Furthermore, building upon past attempts to use experience
replay to guide the training of neural samplers, we derive a way to combine
historical samples with annealed importance sampling weights within a replay
buffer. On synthetic multi-modal targets (in both continuous and discrete
spaces) and the Boltzmann distribution of alanine dipeptide conformations, we
demonstrate improvements in approximating the true distribution as well as
training stability compared to both amortised and Monte Carlo methods.

Result: 在真实人形机器人实验中表现出高成功率和低重复动作率。

Conclusion: CFG-DP显著提升了序列机器人任务的确定性控制和执行可靠性。

Abstract: Temporal sequential tasks challenge humanoid robots, as existing Diffusion
Policy (DP) and Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) methods often lack
temporal context, resulting in local optima traps and excessive repetitive
actions. To address these issues, this paper introduces a Classifier-Free
Guidance-Based Diffusion Policy (CFG-DP), a novel framework to enhance DP by
integrating Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) with conditional and unconditional
models. Specifically, CFG leverages timestep inputs to track task progression
and ensure precise cycle termination. It dynamically adjusts action predictions
based on task phase, using a guidance factor tuned to balance temporal
coherence and action accuracy. Real-world experiments on a humanoid robot
demonstrate high success rates and minimal repetitive actions. Furthermore, we
assessed the model's ability to terminate actions and examined how different
components and parameter adjustments affect its performance. This framework
significantly enhances deterministic control and execution reliability for
sequential robotic tasks.

Conclusion: 模型在姿态估计和行为克隆等任务中表现有效，支持跨传感器模型迁移。

Abstract: Today's visuo-tactile sensors come in many shapes and sizes, making it
challenging to develop general-purpose tactile representations. This is because
most models are tied to a specific sensor design. To address this challenge, we
propose two approaches to cross-sensor image generation. The first is an
end-to-end method that leverages paired data (Touch2Touch). The second method
builds an intermediate depth representation and does not require paired data
(T2D2: Touch-to-Depth-to-Touch). Both methods enable the use of sensor-specific
models across multiple sensors via the cross-sensor touch generation process.
Together, these models offer flexible solutions for sensor translation,
depending on data availability and application needs. We demonstrate their
effectiveness on downstream tasks such as in-hand pose estimation and behavior
cloning, successfully transferring models trained on one sensor to another.

Abstract: Maintaining an up-to-date map that accurately reflects recent changes in the
environment is crucial, especially for robots that repeatedly traverse the same
space. Failing to promptly update the changed regions can degrade map quality,
resulting in poor localization, inefficient operations, and even lost robots.
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently seen widespread adoption in online
map reconstruction due to its dense, differentiable, and photorealistic
properties, yet accurately and efficiently updating the regions of change
remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose VG-Mapping, a novel online
3DGS-based mapping system tailored for such semi-static scenes. Our approach
introduces a hybrid representation that augments 3DGS with a TSDF-based voxel
map to efficiently identify changed regions in a scene, along with a
variation-aware density control strategy that inserts or deletes Gaussian
primitives in regions undergoing change. Furthermore, to address the absence of
public benchmarks for this task, we construct a RGB-D dataset comprising both
synthetic and real-world semi-static environments. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method substantially improves the rendering quality and
map update efficiency in semi-static scenes. The code and dataset are available

Result: 在模拟和真实场景中验证，任务成功率、鲁棒性和扩展性均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架有效支持异构多机器人在复杂场景中的长期协作。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for automatic behavior tree (BT) construction
in heterogeneous multi-robot systems, designed to address the challenges of
adaptability and robustness in dynamic environments. Traditional robots are
limited by fixed functional attributes and cannot efficiently reconfigure their
strategies in response to task failures or environmental changes. To overcome
this limitation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate and
extend BTs dynamically, combining the reasoning and generalization power of
LLMs with the modularity and recovery capability of BTs. The proposed framework
consists of four interconnected modules task initialization, task assignment,
BT update, and failure node detection which operate in a closed loop. Robots
tick their BTs during execution, and upon encountering a failure node, they can
either extend the tree locally or invoke a centralized virtual coordinator
(Alex) to reassign subtasks and synchronize BTs across peers. This design
enables long-term cooperative execution in heterogeneous teams. We validate the
framework on 60 tasks across three simulated scenarios and in a real-world cafe
environment with a robotic arm and a wheeled-legged robot. Results show that
our method consistently outperforms baseline approaches in task success rate,
robustness, and scalability, demonstrating its effectiveness for multi-robot
collaboration in complex scenarios.

Conclusion: FORM通过密集因子图平滑和单地图匹配，显著提升了LiDAR里程计的实时性和轨迹质量。

Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become a de-facto sensor for
many robot state estimation tasks, spurring development of many LiDAR Odometry
(LO) methods in recent years. While some smoothing-based LO methods have been
proposed, most require matching against multiple scans, resulting in
sub-real-time performance. Due to this, most prior works estimate a single
state at a time and are ``submap''-based. This architecture propagates any
error in pose estimation to the fixed submap and can cause jittery trajectories
and degrade future registrations. We propose Fixed-Lag Odometry with Reparative
Mapping (FORM), a LO method that performs smoothing over a densely connected
factor graph while utilizing a single iterative map for matching. This allows
for both real-time performance and active correction of the local map as pose
estimates are further refined. We evaluate on a wide variety of datasets to
show that FORM is robust, accurate, real-time, and provides smooth trajectory
estimates when compared to prior state-of-the-art LO methods.

attention due to their advantages of combining the agility of legged locomotion
and the efficiency of wheeled motion. But along with expanded performance, the
whole-body control of wheeled-legged robots remains challenging for hybrid
locomotion. In this paper, we present ATRos, a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based hybrid locomotion framework to achieve hybrid walking-driving
motions on the wheeled-legged robot. Without giving predefined gait patterns,
our planner aims to intelligently coordinate simultaneous wheel and leg
movements, thereby achieving improved terrain adaptability and improved energy
efficiency. Based on RL techniques, our approach constructs a prediction policy
network that could estimate external environmental states from proprioceptive
sensory information, and the outputs are then fed into an actor critic network
to produce optimal joint commands. The feasibility of the proposed framework is
validated through both simulations and real-world experiments across diverse
terrains, including flat ground, stairs, and grassy surfaces. The hybrid
locomotion framework shows robust performance over various unseen terrains,
highlighting its generalization capability.

Result: 晶格取向显著影响夹持器的柔顺性、接触力和能量效率，不同配置各有优势。

Conclusion: 研究为软-刚性混合夹持器设计提供了新思路，优化了农业自动化中的采摘性能，减少作物损伤。

Abstract: The agricultural sector is rapidly evolving to meet growing global food
demands, yet tasks like fruit and vegetable handling remain labor-intensive,
causing inefficiencies and post-harvest losses. Automation, particularly
selective harvesting, offers a viable solution, with soft robotics emerging as
a key enabler. This study introduces a novel hybrid gripper for tomato
harvesting, incorporating a rigid outer frame with a soft auxetic internal
lattice. The six-finger, 3D caging-effect design enables gentle yet secure
grasping in unstructured environments. Uniquely, the work investigates the
effect of auxetic lattice orientation on grasping conformability, combining
experimental validation with 2D Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and nonlinear
finite element analysis (FEA). Auxetic configurations with unit cell
inclinations of 0 deg, 30 deg, 45 deg, and 60 deg are evaluated, and their
grasping forces, deformation responses, and motor torque requirements are
systematically compared. Results demonstrate that lattice orientation strongly
influences compliance, contact forces, and energy efficiency, with distinct
advantages across configurations. This comparative framework highlights the
novelty of tailoring auxetic geometries to optimize robotic gripper
performance. The findings provide new insights into soft-rigid hybrid gripper
design, advancing automation strategies for precision agriculture while
minimizing crop damage.

TL;DR: LOMORO是一种在线协调方案，用于多机器人协作目标监控、路径规划和资源充电，通过资源感知任务协调和在线适应算法优化机器人数量和资源使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长期监控动态目标对人类操作员来说繁琐且对单个机器人不可行，多机器人协作可提高效率，但现有方法常忽略资源限制和机器人数量优化。

Method: 提出LOMORO方案，包括多机器人任务分配建模、资源感知任务协调算法（结合高层目标分配和低层多目标路由）及在线适应算法。

Result: 确保所有目标的监控间隔上限和机器人资源下限，同时最小化活跃机器人数量，通过大规模仿真验证了有效性。

Conclusion: LOMORO在多机器人协作监控中优化了资源使用和机器人数量，适用于动态环境和资源受限场景。

Abstract: Long-term monitoring of numerous dynamic targets can be tedious for a human
operator and infeasible for a single robot, e.g., to monitor wild flocks,
detect intruders, search and rescue. Fleets of autonomous robots can be
effective by acting collaboratively and concurrently. However, the online
coordination is challenging due to the unknown behaviors of the targets and the
limited perception of each robot. Existing work often deploys all robots
available without minimizing the fleet size, or neglects the constraints on
their resources such as battery and memory. This work proposes an online
coordination scheme called LOMORO for collaborative target monitoring, path
routing and resource charging. It includes three core components: (I) the
modeling of multi-robot task assignment problem under the constraints on
resources and monitoring intervals; (II) the resource-aware task coordination
algorithm iterates between the high-level assignment of dynamic targets and the
low-level multi-objective routing via the Martin's algorithm; (III) the online
adaptation algorithm in case of unpredictable target behaviors and robot
failures. It ensures the explicitly upper-bounded monitoring intervals for all
targets and the lower-bounded resource levels for all robots, while minimizing
the average number of active robots. The proposed methods are validated
extensively via large-scale simulations against several baselines, under
different road networks, robot velocities, charging rates and monitoring
intervals.

Motivation: 解决月球导航中未建模的电离层和等离子体层延迟问题，以提升GNSS信号在月球定位中的精度。

Method: 使用Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM)和低成本射线追踪算法模拟不同条件下的信号延迟。

Result: 平均延迟约为1米，但在高太阳活动下可达100米；射线弯曲延迟较小但对低高度路径不可忽略。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计鲁棒的月球定位算法提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Recent advancements in lunar positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) have
demonstrated that terrestrial GNSS signals, including weak sidelobe
transmissions, can be exploited for lunar spacecraft positioning and timing.
While GNSS-based navigation at the Moon has been validated recently, unmodeled
ionospheric and plasmaspheric delays remain a significant error source,
particularly given the unique signal geometry and extended propagation paths.
This paper characterizes these delays using the Global Core Plasma Model (GCPM)
and a custom low-cost ray-tracing algorithm that iteratively solves for bent
signal paths. We simulate first-, second-, and third-order group delays, as
well as excess path length from ray bending, for GNSS signals received at both
lunar orbit and the lunar south pole under varying solar and geomagnetic
conditions. Results show that mean group delays are typically on the order of 1
m, but can exceed 100 m for low-altitude ray paths during high solar activity,
while bending delays are generally smaller but non-negligible for low-altitude
ray paths. We also quantify the influence of signal frequency, geomagnetic
$K_p$ index, and solar R12 index. These findings inform the design of robust
positioning and timing algorithms that utilize terrestrial GNSS signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法过于依赖简单指标，无法捕捉预测模型在复杂交互和安全关键场景中的细微行为。

Method: 提出了一种新颖的测试框架，考虑了场景结构、地图上下文、代理密度和空间分布等因素。

Conclusion: 框架为安全驱动的预测验证奠定了基础，有助于识别易失败的极端案例并开发鲁棒的预测系统。

Abstract: Current evaluation methods for autonomous driving prediction models rely
heavily on simplistic metrics such as Average Displacement Error (ADE) and
Final Displacement Error (FDE). While these metrics offer basic performance
assessments, they fail to capture the nuanced behavior of prediction modules
under complex, interactive, and safety-critical driving scenarios. For
instance, existing benchmarks do not distinguish the influence of nearby versus
distant agents, nor systematically test model robustness across varying
multi-agent interactions. This paper addresses this critical gap by proposing a
novel testing framework that evaluates prediction performance under diverse
scene structures, saying, map context, agent density and spatial distribution.
Through extensive empirical analysis, we quantify the differential impact of
agent proximity on target trajectory prediction and identify scenario-specific
failure cases that are not exposed by traditional metrics. Our findings
highlight key vulnerabilities in current state-of-the-art prediction models and
demonstrate the importance of scenario-aware evaluation. The proposed framework
lays the groundwork for rigorous, safety-driven prediction validation,
contributing significantly to the identification of failure-prone corner cases
and the development of robust, certifiable prediction systems for autonomous
vehicles.

Conclusion: 该方法为通用机器人策略的评估和改进提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist robot policies can now perform a wide range of manipulation
skills, but evaluating and improving their ability with unfamiliar objects and
instructions remains a significant challenge. Rigorous evaluation requires a
large number of real-world rollouts, while systematic improvement demands
additional corrective data with expert labels. Both of these processes are
slow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable
alternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,
a key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle
multi-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world
model compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view
prediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon
interactions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a
step forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be
used to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist
robot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a
pose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control
through frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k
trajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally
consistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for
over 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance
without real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful
trajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our
approach can improve policy success by 44.7\%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的训练范式，从路径模仿转向决策理解，通过Compass-Data-22k数据集和动态奖励函数，使智能体在导航任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型视觉语言模型在导航任务中依赖模仿专家轨迹，限制了智能体的探索和泛化能力。

Method: 引入Compass-Data-22k数据集和动态奖励函数，采用SFT-then-RFT训练方法。

Result: 7B参数的智能体在导航基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越更大的专有模型，并在真实机器人上实现稳健导航。

Conclusion: 新范式通过决策理解显著提升了智能体的导航能力，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The dominant paradigm for training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in
navigation relies on imitating expert trajectories. This approach reduces the
complex navigation task to a sequence-to-sequence replication of a single
correct path, fundamentally limiting the agent's ability to explore and
generalize. In this work, we argue for and introduce a new paradigm: a shift
from Path Imitation to Decision Understanding. The goal of this paradigm is to
build agents that do not just follow, but truly understand how to navigate. We
materialize this through two core contributions: first, we introduce
Compass-Data-22k, a novel 22k-trajectory dataset.Its Reinforcement Fine-Tuning
(RFT) subset provides a panoramic view of the decision landscape by annotating
all feasible actions with A* geodesic distances. Second, we design a novel
gap-aware hybrid reward function that dynamically adapts its feedback to
decision certainty, shifting between decisive signals for optimal actions and
nuanced scores to encourage exploration. Integrated into an SFT-then-RFT
recipe, our CompassNav agent is trained not to memorize static routes, but to
develop an internal ``compass'' that constantly intuits the direction to the
goal by evaluating the relative quality of all possible moves. This approach
enables our 7B agent to set a new state-of-the-art on Goal navigation
benchmarks, outperforming even larger proprietary models, and achieve robust
real-world goal navigation on a physical robot.

Result: 实验表明，EFN显著提高了适应性、鲁棒性和成功率。

Conclusion: Dejavu为代理在部署后持续优化行为提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Embodied agents face a fundamental limitation: once deployed in real-world
environments to perform specific tasks, they are unable to acquire new useful
knowledge to enhance task performance. In this paper, we propose a general
post-deployment learning framework called Dejavu, which employs an Experience
Feedback Network (EFN) and augments the frozen Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
policy with retrieved execution memories. EFN automatically identifies
contextually successful prior action experiences and conditions action
prediction on this retrieved guidance. We adopt reinforcement learning with
semantic similarity rewards on EFN to ensure that the predicted actions align
with past successful behaviors under current observations. During deployment,
EFN continually enriches its memory with new trajectories, enabling the agent
to exhibit "learning from experience" despite fixed weights. Experiments across
diverse embodied tasks show that EFN significantly improves adaptability,
robustness, and success rates over frozen baselines. These results highlight a
promising path toward embodied agents that continually refine their behavior
after deployment.

Motivation: 当前单机器人方法在交互中忽略了代理间的动态关系，导致接触不准确、穿透和不真实的运动。Harmanoid旨在解决这一问题，实现更丰富的多机器人交互。

Method: Harmanoid包含两个关键组件：1) 接触感知的运动重定向，通过对齐SMPL接触点与机器人顶点恢复身体协调；2) 交互驱动的运动控制器，利用交互特定奖励强化协调关键点和物理合理的接触。

Result: 实验表明，Harmanoid在交互运动模仿上显著优于现有单机器人框架，后者在此类场景中表现不佳。

Conclusion: Harmanoid通过显式建模代理间接触和交互感知动态，成功捕捉了单机器人框架忽略的耦合行为，为多机器人交互提供了更真实的解决方案。

Abstract: The true promise of humanoid robotics lies beyond single-agent autonomy: two
or more humanoids must engage in physically grounded, socially meaningful
whole-body interactions that echo the richness of human social interaction.
However, single-humanoid methods suffer from the isolation issue, ignoring
inter-agent dynamics and causing misaligned contacts, interpenetrations, and
unrealistic motions. To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid
motion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two
robots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid
comprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which
restores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices,
and (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages
interaction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically
plausible contacts. By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and
interaction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between
humanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook. Experiments
demonstrate that Harmanoid significantly improves interactive motion imitation,
surpassing existing single-humanoid frameworks that largely fail in such
scenarios.

Result: 在开门任务中，UF-RNN表现出更强的适应性，成功率高过传统随机RNN基线。

Conclusion: 将不确定性驱动的预见性融入模仿学习可显著提升机器人处理不可预测环境的能力。

Abstract: Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active "Foresight" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.

Conclusion: 研究表明感知与内部预测的交互对注意力自组织发展至关重要，支持发育机制对稳健注意力形成的贡献。

Abstract: This study investigates the developmental interaction between top-down (TD)
and bottom-up (BU) visual attention in robotic learning. Our goal is to
understand how structured, human-like attentional behavior emerges through the
mutual adaptation of TD and BU mechanisms over time. To this end, we propose a
novel attention model $A^3 RNN$ that integrates predictive TD signals and
saliency-based BU cues through a bi-directional attention architecture.
  We evaluate our model in robotic manipulation tasks using imitation learning.
Experimental results show that attention behaviors evolve throughout training,
from saliency-driven exploration to prediction-driven direction. Initially, BU
attention highlights visually salient regions, which guide TD processes, while
as learning progresses, TD attention stabilizes and begins to reshape what is
perceived as salient. This trajectory reflects principles from cognitive
science and the free-energy framework, suggesting the importance of
self-organizing attention through interaction between perception and internal
prediction. Although not explicitly optimized for stability, our model exhibits
more coherent and interpretable attention patterns than baselines, supporting
the idea that developmental mechanisms contribute to robust attention
formation.

Abstract: Efficient physics simulation has significantly accelerated research progress
in robotics applications such as grasping and assembly. The advent of
GPU-accelerated simulation frameworks like Isaac Sim has particularly empowered
learning-based methods, enabling them to tackle increasingly complex tasks. The
PAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni is a versatile mobile manipulator equipped with a
mecanum-wheeled base, allowing omnidirectional movement and a wide range of
task capabilities. However, until now, no model of the robot has been available
in Isaac Sim. In this paper, we introduce such a model, calibrated to
approximate the behavior of the real robot, with a focus on its omnidirectional
drive dynamics. We present two control models for the omnidirectional drive: a
physically accurate model that replicates real-world wheel dynamics and a
lightweight velocity-based model optimized for learning-based applications.
With these models, we introduce a learning-based calibration approach to
approximate the real robot's S-shaped velocity profile using minimal trajectory
data recordings. This simulation should allow researchers to experiment with
the robot and perform efficient learning-based control in diverse environments.

Abstract: Chemistry, a long-standing discipline, has historically relied on manual and
often time-consuming processes. While some automation exists, the field is now
on the cusp of a significant evolution driven by the integration of robotics
and artificial intelligence (AI), giving rise to the concept of the
robochemist: a new paradigm where autonomous systems assist in designing,
executing, and analyzing experiments. Robochemists integrate mobile
manipulators, advanced perception, teleoperation, and data-driven protocols to
execute experiments with greater adaptability, reproducibility, and safety.
Rather than a fully automated replacement for human chemists, we envisioned the
robochemist as a complementary partner that works collaboratively to enhance
discovery, enabling a more efficient exploration of chemical space and
accelerating innovation in pharmaceuticals, materials science, and sustainable
manufacturing. This article traces the technologies, applications, and
challenges that define this transformation, highlighting both the opportunities
and the responsibilities that accompany the emergence of the robochemist.
Ultimately, the future of chemistry is argued to lie in a symbiotic partnership
where human intuition and expertise is amplified by robotic precision and

Abstract: In this paper, we develop and open-source, for the first time, a square-root
filter (SRF)-based visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), termed sqrtVINS,
which is ultra-fast, numerically stable, and capable of dynamic initialization
even under extreme conditions (i.e., extremely small time window). Despite
recent advancements in VINS, resource constraints and numerical instability on
embedded (robotic) systems with limited precision remain critical challenges. A
square-root covariance-based filter offers a promising solution by providing
numerical stability, efficient memory usage, and guaranteed positive
semi-definiteness. However, canonical SRFs suffer from inefficiencies caused by
disruptions in the triangular structure of the covariance matrix during
updates. The proposed method significantly improves VINS efficiency with a
novel Cholesky decomposition (LLT)-based SRF update, by fully exploiting the
system structure to preserve the structure. Moreover, we design a fast, robust,
dynamic initialization method, which first recovers the minimal states without
triangulating 3D features and then efficiently performs iterative SRF update to
refine the full states, enabling seamless VINS operation. The proposed
LLT-based SRF is extensively verified through numerical studies, demonstrating
superior numerical stability and achieving robust efficient performance on
32-bit single-precision floats, operating at twice the speed of
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our initialization method, tested on both
mobile workstations and Jetson Nano computers, achieving a high success rate of
initialization even within a 100 ms window under minimal conditions. Finally,
the proposed sqrtVINS is extensively validated across diverse scenarios,
demonstrating strong efficiency, robustness, and reliability. The full
open-source implementation is released to support future research and
applications.

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了可行着陆姿态集，并能有效复用过去知识，加速新物体学习。

Abstract: Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently
gained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,
the focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective
of its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to
accurately "throw-flip" objects to a desired landing pose (position and
orientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from
parasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing
poses. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the
impulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that
effectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the
feasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free
flight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.
Real robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip
objects to a pose target within ($\pm$5 cm, $\pm$45 degrees) threshold in
dozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile
dynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to
unseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods. Additionally, we show
that past knowledge on in-hand object spinning can be effectively reused,
accelerating learning by 70% when throwing a new object with a Center of Mass
(CoM) shift. A video summarizing the proposed method and the hardware
experiments is available at https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU.

Conclusion: 分层规划器在长时规划和目标跟踪任务中表现优异，显著提升了跟踪性能。

Abstract: Achieving persistent tracking of multiple dynamic targets over a large
spatial area poses significant challenges for a single-robot system with
constrained sensing capabilities. As the robot moves to track different
targets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them
progressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage
uncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing
track of targets that remain unseen for too long. However, most existing
approaches rely on short planning horizons and assume small, bounded
environments, resulting in poor tracking performance and target loss in
large-scale scenarios. In this paper, we present a hierarchical planner for
tracking multiple moving targets with an aerial vehicle. To address the
challenge of tracking non-static targets, our method incorporates motion models
and uncertainty propagation during path execution, allowing for more informed
decision-making. We decompose the multi-target tracking task into sub-tasks of
single target search and detection, and our proposed pipeline consists a novel
low-level coverage planner that enables searching for a target in an evolving
belief area, and an estimation method to assess the likelihood of success for
each sub-task, making it possible to convert the active target tracking task to
a Markov decision process (MDP) that we solve with a tree-based algorithm to
determine the sequence of sub-tasks. We validate our approach in simulation,
demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing planners for active target
tracking tasks, and our proposed planner outperforms existing approaches,
achieving a reduction of 11-70% in final uncertainty across different
environments.

Conclusion: 对称性在机器人步态设计中起关键作用，该方法显著提高了步态适应性和动态运动策略的灵活性。

Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit a wide range of viable gaits, but generating
specific footfall sequences often requires laborious expert tuning of numerous
variables, such as touch-down and lift-off events and holonomic constraints for
each leg. This paper presents a unified reinforcement learning framework for
generating versatile quadrupedal gaits by leveraging the intrinsic symmetries
and velocity-period relationship of dynamic legged systems. We propose a
symmetry-guided reward function design that incorporates temporal,
morphological, and time-reversal symmetries. By focusing on preserved
symmetries and natural dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for
predefined trajectories, enabling smooth transitions between diverse locomotion
patterns such as trotting, bounding, half-bounding, and galloping. Implemented
on the Unitree Go2 robot, our method demonstrates robust performance across a
range of speeds in both simulations and hardware tests, significantly improving
gait adaptability without extensive reward tuning or explicit foot placement
control. This work provides insights into dynamic locomotion strategies and
underscores the crucial role of symmetries in robotic gait design.

Abstract: Galilean symmetry is the natural symmetry of inertial motion that underpins
Newtonian physics. Although rigid-body symmetry is one of the most established
and fundamental tools in robotics, there appears to be no comparable treatment
of Galilean symmetry for a robotics audience. In this paper, we present a
robotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the
community's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations
and pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the
physics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to
Einstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can
be used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that
use inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use
coordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean
matrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields
significant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator
kinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty. We believe that
the time is right for the robotics community to benefit from rediscovering and
extending this classical material and applying it to modern problems.

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上，SuperEx比视距基线提高了12%的地图精度，探索效率也显著提升。

Conclusion: SuperEx为非视距感知在机器人探索中的应用提供了可靠路径，显著提升了地图构建和探索效率。

Abstract: Efficient exploration and mapping in unknown indoor environments is a
fundamental challenge, with high stakes in time-critical settings. In current
systems, robot perception remains confined to line-of-sight; occluded regions
remain unknown until physically traversed, leading to inefficient exploration
when layouts deviate from prior assumptions. In this work, we bring
non-line-of-sight (NLOS) sensing to robotic exploration. We leverage
single-photon LiDARs, which capture time-of-flight histograms that encode the
presence of hidden objects - allowing robots to look around blind corners.
Recent single-photon LiDARs have become practical and portable, enabling
deployment beyond controlled lab settings. Prior NLOS works target 3D
reconstruction in static, lab-based scenarios, and initial efforts toward
NLOS-aided navigation consider simplified geometries. We introduce SuperEx, a
framework that integrates NLOS sensing directly into the mapping-exploration
loop. SuperEx augments global map prediction with beyond-line-of-sight cues by
(i) carving empty NLOS regions from timing histograms and (ii) reconstructing
occupied structure via a two-step physics-based and data-driven approach that
leverages structural regularities. Evaluations on complex simulated maps and
the real-world KTH Floorplan dataset show a 12% gain in mapping accuracy under
< 30% coverage and improved exploration efficiency compared to line-of-sight
baselines, opening a path to reliable mapping beyond direct visibility.

Conclusion: 群体编码SNNs是资源受限应用中高效节能机器人控制的有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical
challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control
tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy
consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper
introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the
event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy
optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency
and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded
Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations
into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through
gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using
the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental
results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy
savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks
(ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN
policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from
commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during
pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a
promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in
resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in
real-world robotics systems.

Conclusion: 提出的四通道双边控制方法在笛卡尔坐标系中有效，适用于不同结构的机械臂，并能通过解耦维度实现直观操作。

Abstract: Four-channel bilateral control is a method for achieving remote control with
force feedback and adjustment operability by synchronizing the positions and
forces of two manipulators. This is expected to significantly improve the
operability of the remote control in contact-rich tasks. Among these, 4-channel
bilateral control on the Cartesian coordinate system is advantageous owing to
its suitability for manipulators with different structures and because it
allows the dynamics in the Cartesian coordinate system to be adjusted by
adjusting the control parameters, thus achieving intuitive operability for
humans. This paper proposes a 4-channel bilateral control method that achieves
the desired dynamics by decoupling each dimension in the Cartesian coordinate
system regardless of the scaling factor.

Result: 在自动驾驶赛车模拟中，实现了0%碰撞率，并将超车时间减少60%。

Conclusion: 强化学习动态调整参数解决了安全性与竞争性的权衡，为自适应运动规划提供了新思路。

Abstract: Sampling-based trajectory planners are widely used for agile autonomous
driving due to their ability to generate fast, smooth, and kinodynamically
feasible trajectories. However, their behavior is often governed by a cost
function with manually tuned, static weights, which forces a tactical
compromise that is suboptimal across the wide range of scenarios encountered in
a race. To address this shortcoming, we propose using a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent as a high-level behavioral selector that dynamically switches the
cost function parameters of an analytical, low-level trajectory planner during
runtime. We show the effectiveness of our approach in simulation in an
autonomous racing environment where our RL-based planner achieved 0% collision
rate while reducing overtaking time by up to 60% compared to state-of-the-art
static planners. Our new agent now dynamically switches between aggressive and
conservative behaviors, enabling interactive maneuvers unattainable with static
configurations. These results demonstrate that integrating reinforcement
learning as a high-level selector resolves the inherent trade-off between
safety and competitiveness in autonomous racing planners. The proposed
methodology offers a pathway toward adaptive yet interpretable motion planning
for broader autonomous driving applications.

Abstract: Most robotic grasping systems rely on converting sensor data into explicit 3D
point clouds, which is a computational step not found in biological
intelligence. This paper explores a fundamentally different, neuro-inspired
paradigm for 6-DoF grasp detection. We introduce SpikeGrasp, a framework that
mimics the biological visuomotor pathway, processing raw, asynchronous events
from stereo spike cameras, similarly to retinas, to directly infer grasp poses.
Our model fuses these stereo spike streams and uses a recurrent spiking neural
network, analogous to high-level visual processing, to iteratively refine grasp
hypotheses without ever reconstructing a point cloud. To validate this
approach, we built a large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset. Experiments show
that SpikeGrasp surpasses traditional point-cloud-based baselines, especially
in cluttered and textureless scenes, and demonstrates remarkable data
efficiency. By establishing the viability of this end-to-end, neuro-inspired
approach, SpikeGrasp paves the way for future systems capable of the fluid and
efficient manipulation seen in nature, particularly for dynamic objects.

Abstract: The scalability of robotic learning is fundamentally bottlenecked by the
significant cost and labor of real-world data collection. While simulated data
offers a scalable alternative, it often fails to generalize to the real world
due to significant gaps in visual appearance, physical properties, and object
interactions. To address this, we propose RoboSimGS, a novel Real2Sim2Real
framework that converts multi-view real-world images into scalable,
high-fidelity, and physically interactive simulation environments for robotic
manipulation. Our approach reconstructs scenes using a hybrid representation:
3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) captures the photorealistic appearance of the
environment, while mesh primitives for interactive objects ensure accurate
physics simulation. Crucially, we pioneer the use of a Multi-modal Large
Language Model (MLLM) to automate the creation of physically plausible,
articulated assets. The MLLM analyzes visual data to infer not only physical
properties (e.g., density, stiffness) but also complex kinematic structures
(e.g., hinges, sliding rails) of objects. We demonstrate that policies trained
entirely on data generated by RoboSimGS achieve successful zero-shot
sim-to-real transfer across a diverse set of real-world manipulation tasks.
Furthermore, data from RoboSimGS significantly enhances the performance and
generalization capabilities of SOTA methods. Our results validate RoboSimGS as
a powerful and scalable solution for bridging the sim-to-real gap.

Abstract: Building generalist robot policies that can handle diverse tasks in
open-ended environments is a central challenge in robotics. To leverage
knowledge from large-scale pretraining, prior work has typically built
generalist policies either on top of vision-language understanding models
(VLMs) or generative models. However, both semantic understanding from
vision-language pretraining and visual dynamics modeling from visual-generation
pretraining are crucial for embodied robots. Recent unified models of
generation and understanding have demonstrated strong capabilities in both
comprehension and generation through large-scale pretraining. We posit that
robotic policy learning can likewise benefit from the combined strengths of
understanding, planning and continuous future representation learning. Building
on this insight, we introduce UniCoD, which acquires the ability to dynamically
model high-dimensional visual features through pretraining on over 1M
internet-scale instructional manipulation videos. Subsequently, UniCoD is
fine-tuned on data collected from the robot embodiment, enabling the learning
of mappings from predictive representations to action tokens. Extensive
experiments show our approach consistently outperforms baseline methods in
terms of 9\% and 12\% across simulation environments and real-world
out-of-distribution tasks.

as growth for future research in oceanography and robot algorithms. Mission
specification is flexible, and can be specified declaratively. Behavior
specification is similarly flexible, supporting simultaneous use of real-time
task planning and hard-coded user specified plans. These features were
demonstrated in the field on Sentry, in addition to a variety of simulated
cases. These results are discussed, and future work is outlined.

Motivation: 现有方法缺乏生成可控多样性轨迹的机制，而这对安全规划至关重要。

Method: 提出PrefCVAE框架，利用弱标签偏好对赋予潜在变量语义属性。

Result: PrefCVAE在不降低基线准确性的情况下，实现了可控且语义有意义的预测。

Conclusion: 偏好监督是增强生成模型的有效且经济的方法。

Abstract: Deep generative models such as conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs)
have shown great promise for predicting trajectories of surrounding agents in
autonomous vehicle planning. State-of-the-art models have achieved remarkable
accuracy in such prediction tasks. Besides accuracy, diversity is also crucial
for safe planning because human behaviors are inherently uncertain and
multimodal. However, existing methods generally lack a scheme to generate
controllably diverse trajectories, which is arguably more useful than randomly
diversified trajectories, to the end of safe planning. To address this, we
propose PrefCVAE, an augmented CVAE framework that uses weakly labeled
preference pairs to imbue latent variables with semantic attributes. Using
average velocity as an example attribute, we demonstrate that PrefCVAE enables
controllable, semantically meaningful predictions without degrading baseline
accuracy. Our results show the effectiveness of preference supervision as a
cost-effective way to enhance sampling-based generative models.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ROGER方法通过在线调整奖励权重增益，解决了机器人运动学习中的约束违反问题，并在实际机器人上实现了高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人运动学习方法依赖离线选择奖励权重增益，无法保证训练中的约束满足。

Method: 提出ROGER方法，根据交互过程中的惩罚动态调整奖励权重增益，避免约束违反。

Result: 在60公斤四足机器人上实现近零约束违反，性能提升50%；在MuJoCo基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: ROGER为约束满足的实时机器人运动学习提供了有效解决方案，简化了奖励权重调优。

Abstract: Existing robot locomotion learning techniques rely heavily on the offline
selection of proper reward weighting gains and cannot guarantee constraint
satisfaction (i.e., constraint violation) during training. Thus, this work aims
to address both issues by proposing Reward-Oriented Gains via Embodied
Regulation (ROGER), which adapts reward-weighting gains online based on
penalties received throughout the embodied interaction process. The ratio
between the positive reward (primary reward) and negative reward (penalty)
gains is automatically reduced as the learning approaches the constraint
thresholds to avoid violation. Conversely, the ratio is increased when learning
is in safe states to prioritize performance. With a 60-kg quadruped robot,
ROGER achieved near-zero constraint violation throughout multiple learning
trials. It also achieved up to 50% more primary reward than the equivalent
state-of-the-art techniques. In MuJoCo continuous locomotion benchmarks,
including a single-leg hopper, ROGER exhibited comparable or up to 100% higher
performance and 60% less torque usage and orientation deviation compared to
those trained with the default reward function. Finally, real-world locomotion
learning of a physical quadruped robot was achieved from scratch within one
hour without any falls. Therefore, this work contributes to
constraint-satisfying real-world continual robot locomotion learning and
simplifies reward weighting gain tuning, potentially facilitating the
development of physical robots and those that learn in the real world.

*Christopher D. Hsu,Pratik Chaudhari*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出使用Universal Scene Description (USD)作为LLM机器人任务的通用场景表示方法，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为特定任务设计，缺乏通用性。USD作为一种XML场景图，既能被LLM理解，又足够丰富支持多种任务。

Method: 开发了“Real to USD”系统，利用四足机器人构建室内环境的USD表示，并通过Gemini解析USD进行场景理解和规划。

Result: 在真实和模拟环境中验证了USD的有效性，展示了复杂推理和规划能力。

Conclusion: USD是一种通用且有效的场景表示方法，适用于LLM机器人任务。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can help robots reason about abstract task
specifications. This requires augmenting classical representations of the
environment used by robots with natural language-based priors. There are a
number of existing approaches to doing so, but they are tailored to specific
tasks, e.g., visual-language models for navigation, language-guided neural
radiance fields for mapping, etc. This paper argues that the Universal Scene
Description (USD) language is an effective and general representation of
geometric, photometric and semantic information in the environment for
LLM-based robotics tasks. Our argument is simple: a USD is an XML-based scene
graph, readable by LLMs and humans alike, and rich enough to support
essentially any task -- Pixar developed this language to store assets, scenes
and even movies. We demonstrate a ``Real to USD'' system using a Unitree Go2
quadruped robot carrying LiDAR and a RGB camera that (i) builds an explicit USD
representation of indoor environments with diverse objects and challenging
settings with lots of glass, and (ii) parses the USD using Google's Gemini to
demonstrate scene understanding, complex inferences, and planning. We also
study different aspects of this system in simulated warehouse and hospital
settings using Nvidia's Issac Sim. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Voronoi覆盖控制在应急场景中存在局限性，如异构机器人能力差异、初始部署配置集中以及时间紧迫性。

Method: 采用双层架构，分别优化空中和地面机器人位置，空中机器人通过空投将地面传感器部署到高优先级区域。

Result: 仿真结果显示响应时间减少88%，目标传感器覆盖在25秒内完成（初始传感器损失18.5%）。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了应急响应效率，适用于异构机器人团队的快速部署。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-layer Voronoi coverage control approach for
coordinating hybrid aerial-ground robot teams in hazardous material emergency
response scenarios. Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods face three
critical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities
with vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations,
and urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual
convergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled
two-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot
positioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to
high-priority locations. We provide detailed implementation of bounded Voronoi
cell computation, efficient numerical integration techniques for
importance-weighted centroids, and robust control strategies that prevent agent
trapping. Simulation results demonstrate an 88% reduction in response time,
achieving target sensor coverage (18.5% of initial sensor loss) in 25 seconds
compared to 220 seconds for ground-only deployment. Complete implementation
code is available at https://github.com/dHutchings/ME292B.

Result: 识别了六种常用的触觉数据表示结构，并提供了选择指南。

Conclusion: 论文为触觉数据表示的选择提供了实用指南，强调了硬件、任务需求和信息编码之间的关系。

Abstract: Robotic tactile perception is a complex process involving several
computational steps performed at different levels. Tactile information is
shaped by the interplay of robot actions, the mechanical properties of its
body, and the software that processes the data. In this respect, high-level
computation, required to process and extract information, is commonly performed
by adapting existing techniques from other domains, such as computer vision,
which expects input data to be properly structured. Therefore, it is necessary
to transform tactile sensor data to match a specific data structure. This
operation directly affects the tactile information encoded and, as a
consequence, the task execution. This survey aims to address this specific
aspect of the tactile perception pipeline, namely Data Representation. The
paper first clearly defines its contributions to the perception pipeline and
then reviews how previous studies have dealt with the problem of representing
tactile information, investigating the relationships among hardware,
representations, and high-level computation methods. The analysis has led to
the identification of six structures commonly used in the literature to
represent data. The manuscript provides discussions and guidelines for properly
selecting a representation depending on operating conditions, including the
available hardware, the tactile information required to be encoded, and the
task at hand.

Result: 仿真验证了接触力和位置的准确恢复，硬件实验显示亚厘米级定位精度和低于0.2N的力误差。

Conclusion: 该方法通过直接扭矩测量和校准，显著提高了接触检测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: This paper presents a method for detecting and localizing contact along robot
legs using distributed joint torque sensors and a single hip-mounted
force-torque (FT) sensor using a generalized momentum-based observer framework.
We designed a low-cost strain-gauge-based joint torque sensor that can be
installed on every joint to provide direct torque measurements, eliminating the
need for complex friction models and providing more accurate torque readings
than estimation based on motor current. Simulation studies on a floating-based
2-DoF robot leg verified that the proposed framework accurately recovers
contact force and location along the thigh and shin links. Through a
calibration procedure, our torque sensor achieved an average 96.4% accuracy
relative to ground truth measurements. Building upon the torque sensor, we
performed hardware experiments on a 2-DoF manipulator, which showed
sub-centimeter contact localization accuracy and force errors below 0.2 N.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多目标强化学习（MORL）的人形机器人运动框架，平衡了命令跟踪和外部力顺应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法主要强调鲁棒性，但缺乏对外部力的顺应性，尤其是在不稳定的人形机器人上。

Method: 采用偏好条件化的MORL框架，结合刚性命令跟踪和顺应行为，并通过速度阻力因子建模外部力。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中验证了框架的有效性，提高了适应性和收敛性。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了可部署的偏好条件化人形机器人运动。

Abstract: Humanoid locomotion requires not only accurate command tracking for
navigation but also compliant responses to external forces during human
interaction. Despite significant progress, existing RL approaches mainly
emphasize robustness, yielding policies that resist external forces but lack
compliance-particularly challenging for inherently unstable humanoids. In this
work, we address this by formulating humanoid locomotion as a multi-objective
optimization problem that balances command tracking and external force
compliance. We introduce a preference-conditioned multi-objective RL (MORL)
framework that integrates rigid command following and compliant behaviors
within a single omnidirectional locomotion policy. External forces are modeled
via velocity-resistance factor for consistent reward design, and training
leverages an encoder-decoder structure that infers task-relevant privileged
features from deployable observations. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments on a humanoid robot. Experimental results
indicate that our framework not only improves adaptability and convergence over
standard pipelines, but also realizes deployable preference-conditioned
humanoid locomotion.

TL;DR: GRIP是一个统一的模块化框架，用于机器人在动态、杂乱和语义复杂环境中的导航，通过三种变体（GRIP-L、GRIP-F、GRIP-R）实现高效、可扩展的导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态先验或有限记忆，限制了在部分可观测性和语义模糊性下的适应性。

Method: GRIP结合动态2D网格构建、开放词汇对象接地、共现感知符号规划和混合策略执行（行为克隆、D*搜索和网格条件控制）。

Result: 在AI2-THOR和RoboTHOR基准测试中，GRIP在长时任务中实现了高达9.6%的成功率和2倍以上的路径效率提升。

Conclusion: GRIP是一个鲁棒、可扩展且可解释的框架，能够桥接仿真和现实世界导航。

Abstract: Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often
rely on static priors or limited memory, constraining adaptability under
partial observability and semantic ambiguity. We present GRIP, Grid-based Relay
with Intermediate Planning, a unified, modular framework with three scalable
variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid
construction, open-vocabulary object grounding, co-occurrence-aware symbolic
planning, and hybrid policy execution using behavioral cloning, D* search, and
grid-conditioned control. Empirical results on AI2-THOR and RoboTHOR benchmarks
show that GRIP achieves up to 9.6% higher success rates and over $2\times$
improvement in path efficiency (SPL and SAE) on long-horizon tasks. Qualitative
analyses reveal interpretable symbolic plans in ambiguous scenes. Real-world
deployment on a Jetbot further validates GRIP's generalization under sensor
noise and environmental variation. These results position GRIP as a robust,
scalable, and explainable framework bridging simulation and real-world
navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动驾驶流水线中，全局规划的最优性信息在传递到局部规划时通常简化为稀疏的路径点，导致局部规划缺乏上下文信息，影响决策质量。

Method: 引入QuayPoints框架，将全局最优性信息（如时间最优性）传递给局部规划，帮助其在偏离最优路径时做出更明智的决策。

Result: 实验表明，集成QuayPoints的规划器能够在四条不同赛道上成功超越速度达自车75%的对手。

Conclusion: 通过QuayPoints传递全局信息能有效提升局部规划的决策能力，尤其在战略超车等场景中表现显著。

Abstract: Autonomous racing requires tight integration between perception, planning and
control to minimize latency as well as timely decision making. A standard
autonomy pipeline comprising a global planner, local planner, and controller
loses information as the higher-level racing context is sequentially propagated
downstream into specific task-oriented context. In particular, the global
planner's understanding of optimality is typically reduced to a sparse set of
waypoints, leaving the local planner to make reactive decisions with limited
context. This paper investigates whether additional global insights,
specifically time-optimality information, can be meaningfully passed to the
local planner to improve downstream decisions. We introduce a framework that
preserves essential global knowledge and conveys it to the local planner
through QuayPoints regions where deviations from the optimal raceline result in
significant compromises to optimality. QuayPoints enable local planners to make
more informed global decisions when deviating from the raceline, such as during
strategic overtaking. To demonstrate this, we integrate QuayPoints into an
existing planner and show that it consistently overtakes opponents traveling at
up to 75% of the ego vehicle's speed across four distinct race tracks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定时间过渡策略未考虑驾驶员实时表现差异，导致接管效果不佳。

Method: 通过合作微分博弈建模共享控制，引入驾驶员特定状态跟踪矩阵动态调整控制权。

Result: 自适应过渡策略减少了轨迹偏差和驾驶员控制负担，提升了车辆稳定性。

Conclusion: 动态调整控制权的自适应策略显著优于传统固定时间过渡方法。

Abstract: The transition of control from autonomous systems to human drivers is
critical in automated driving systems, particularly due to the out-of-the-loop
(OOTL) circumstances that reduce driver readiness and increase reaction times.
Existing takeover strategies are based on fixed time-based transitions, which
fail to account for real-time driver performance variations. This paper
proposes an adaptive transition strategy that dynamically adjusts the control
authority based on both the time and tracking ability of the driver trajectory.
Shared control is modeled as a cooperative differential game, where control
authority is modulated through time-varying objective functions instead of
blending control torques directly. To ensure a more natural takeover, a
driver-specific state-tracking matrix is introduced, allowing the transition to
align with individual control preferences. Multiple transition strategies are
evaluated using a cumulative trajectory error metric. Human-in-the-loop control
scenarios of the standardized ISO lane change maneuvers demonstrate that
adaptive transitions reduce trajectory deviations and driver control effort
compared to conventional strategies. Experiments also confirm that continuously
adjusting control authority based on real-time deviations enhances vehicle
stability while reducing driver effort during takeover.

Abstract: Embodied intelligence has witnessed remarkable progress in recent years,
driven by advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and the
rise of large-scale multimodal models. Among its core challenges, robot
manipulation stands out as a fundamental yet intricate problem, requiring the
seamless integration of perception, planning, and control to enable interaction
within diverse and unstructured environments. This survey presents a
comprehensive overview of robotic manipulation, encompassing foundational
background, task-organized benchmarks and datasets, and a unified taxonomy of
existing methods. We extend the classical division between high-level planning
and low-level control by broadening high-level planning to include language,
code, motion, affordance, and 3D representations, while introducing a new
taxonomy of low-level learning-based control grounded in training paradigms
such as input modeling, latent learning, and policy learning. Furthermore, we
provide the first dedicated taxonomy of key bottlenecks, focusing on data
collection, utilization, and generalization, and conclude with an extensive
review of real-world applications. Compared with prior surveys, our work offers
both a broader scope and deeper insight, serving as an accessible roadmap for
newcomers and a structured reference for experienced researchers. All related

Abstract: Many language-guided robotic systems rely on collapsing spatial reasoning

ambiguity. To address this challenge, we propose RoboMAP, a framework that
represents spatial targets as continuous, adaptive affordance heatmaps. This
dense representation captures the uncertainty in spatial grounding and provides
richer information for downstream policies, thereby significantly enhancing
task success and interpretability. RoboMAP surpasses the previous
state-of-the-art on a majority of grounding benchmarks with up to a 50x speed
improvement, and achieves an 82\% success rate in real-world manipulation.
Across extensive simulated and physical experiments, it demonstrates robust
performance and shows strong zero-shot generalization to navigation. More

Conclusion: GTR2L框架有效提升了自动驾驶的安全性和决策能力，适用于复杂动态环境。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge,
especially in highly dynamic and complex traffic environments where diverse
agents interact and unexpected hazards frequently emerge. Traditional
reinforcement learning (RL) methods often struggle to balance safety,
efficiency, and adaptability, as they primarily focus on reward maximization
without explicitly modeling risk or safety constraints. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a novel game-theoretic risk-shaped RL (GTR2L)
framework for safe AD. GTR2L incorporates a multi-level game-theoretic world
model that jointly predicts the interactive behaviors of surrounding vehicles
and their associated risks, along with an adaptive rollout horizon that adjusts
dynamically based on predictive uncertainty. Furthermore, an uncertainty-aware
barrier mechanism enables flexible modulation of safety boundaries. A dedicated
risk modeling approach is also proposed, explicitly capturing both epistemic
and aleatoric uncertainty to guide constrained policy optimization and enhance
decision-making in complex environments. Extensive evaluations across diverse
and safety-critical traffic scenarios show that GTR2L significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, including human drivers, in terms of success rate,
collision and violation reduction, and driving efficiency. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型依赖大规模数据和模型扩展的高成本问题，提供一种更经济的性能提升方法。

Method: RoVer利用PRM评估候选动作的可靠性并预测动作空间方向，通过共享感知特征缓存降低计算成本。

Result: 实现了测试时扩展的优势，无需额外训练开销即可提升动作决策质量。

Conclusion: RoVer为VLA模型提供了一种高效、可扩展的测试时性能提升方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have become a prominent paradigm for
embodied intelligence, yet further performance improvements typically rely on
scaling up training data and model size -- an approach that is prohibitively
expensive for robotics and fundamentally limited by data collection costs.We
address this limitation with $\mathbf{RoVer}$, an embodied test-time scaling
framework that uses a $\mathbf{Ro}$bot Process Reward Model (PRM) as a
Test-Time $\mathbf{Ver}$ifier to enhance the capabilities of existing VLA
models without modifying their architectures or weights. Specifically, RoVer
(i) assigns scalar-based process rewards to evaluate the reliability of
candidate actions, and (ii) predicts an action-space direction for candidate
expansion/refinement. During inference, RoVer generates multiple candidate
actions concurrently from the base policy, expands them along PRM-predicted
directions, and then scores all candidates with PRM to select the optimal
action for execution. Notably, by caching shared perception features, it can
amortize perception cost and evaluate more candidates under the same test-time
computational budget. Essentially, our approach effectively transforms
available computing resources into better action decision-making, realizing the
benefits of test-time scaling without extra training overhead. Our
contributions are threefold: (1) a general, plug-and-play test-time scaling
framework for VLAs; (2) a PRM that jointly provides scalar process rewards and
an action-space direction to guide exploration; and (3) an efficient
direction-guided sampling strategy that leverages a shared perception cache to
enable scalable candidate generation and selection during inference.

Conclusion: AMO-HEAD是一种有效的解决方案，适用于无人机在复杂室内环境中的航向估计。

Abstract: Accurate and robust heading estimation is crucial for unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) when conducting indoor inspection tasks. However, the cluttered
nature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,
which can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,
this paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation
approach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is
a lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
framework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable
heading estimation. In the proposed approach, gyroscope angular rate
measurements are integrated to propagate the quaternion state, which is
subsequently corrected using accelerometer and magnetometer data. The corrected
quaternion is then used to compute the UAV's heading. An adaptive process noise
covariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope
measurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler
method integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,
a scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection. A
theoretical observability analysis of the proposed AMO-HEAD is performed using
the Lie derivative. Extensive experiments were conducted in real world indoor
environments with customized UAV platforms. The results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in providing precise heading estimation
under magnetically disturbed conditions.

Abstract: Priors are vital for planning under partial observability, yet difficult to
obtain in practice. We present a sampling-based pipeline that leverages
large-scale pretrained generative models to produce probabilistic priors
capturing environmental uncertainty and spatio-semantic relationships in a
zero-shot manner. Conditioned on partial observations, the pipeline recovers
complete RGB-D point cloud samples with occupancy and target semantics,
formulated to be directly useful in configuration-space planning. We establish
a Matterport3D benchmark of rooms partially visible through doorways, where a
robot must navigate to an unobserved target object. Effective priors for this
setting must represent both occupancy and target-location uncertainty in
unobserved regions. Experiments show that our approach recovers commonsense
spatial semantics consistent with ground truth, yielding diverse, clean 3D
point clouds usable in motion planning, highlight the promise of generative
models as a rich source of priors for robotic planning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于模拟学习的策略在工业标准下成功率不足（约80%），且策略链式执行脆弱，需要提升鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Refinery框架，结合贝叶斯优化微调策略和高斯混合模型采样选择初始化条件。

Result: 在机器人装配任务中，平均成功率提升10.98%，达到91.51%，并支持8部件链式装配。

Conclusion: Refinery有效提升了策略鲁棒性和成功率，适用于复杂装配任务。

Abstract: Simulation-based learning has enabled policies for precise, contact-rich
tasks (e.g., robotic assembly) to reach high success rates (~80%) under high
levels of observation noise and control error. Although such performance may be
sufficient for research applications, it falls short of industry standards and
makes policy chaining exceptionally brittle. A key limitation is the high
variance in individual policy performance across diverse initial conditions. We
introduce Refinery, an effective framework that bridges this performance gap,
robustifying policy performance across initial conditions. We propose Bayesian
Optimization-guided fine-tuning to improve individual policies, and Gaussian
Mixture Model-based sampling during deployment to select initializations that
maximize execution success. Using Refinery, we improve mean success rates by
10.98% over state-of-the-art methods in simulation-based learning for robotic
assembly, reaching 91.51% in simulation and comparable performance in the real
world. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these fine-tuned policies can be
chained to accomplish long-horizon, multi-part
assembly$\unicode{x2013}$successfully assembling up to 8 parts without
requiring explicit multi-step training.

Motivation: 现有抓取方法通常针对单一夹具设计，限制了在需要多样化末端执行器的实际场景中的适用性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段（GPP）预测抓取点，第二阶段（AWP）优化抓取角度和宽度，并利用对比学习实现零样本泛化。

Result: 实验结果显示，XGrasp在各种夹具类型上具有竞争力的抓取成功率，同时推理速度显著提升。

Conclusion: XGrasp通过模块化设计和数据增强解决了多夹具抓取的挑战，为未来视觉-语言能力提供了可能。

Abstract: Most robotic grasping methods are typically designed for single gripper
types, which limits their applicability in real-world scenarios requiring
diverse end-effectors. We propose XGrasp, a real-time gripper-aware grasp
detection framework that efficiently handles multiple gripper configurations.
The proposed method addresses data scarcity by systematically augmenting
existing datasets with multi-gripper annotations. XGrasp employs a hierarchical
two-stage architecture. In the first stage, a Grasp Point Predictor (GPP)
identifies optimal locations using global scene information and gripper
specifications. In the second stage, an Angle-Width Predictor (AWP) refines the
grasp angle and width using local features. Contrastive learning in the AWP
module enables zero-shot generalization to unseen grippers by learning
fundamental grasping characteristics. The modular framework integrates
seamlessly with vision foundation models, providing pathways for future
vision-language capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate competitive
grasp success rates across various gripper types, while achieving substantial
improvements in inference speed compared to existing gripper-aware methods.

Result: 在CARLA仿真平台上验证，DRLACP在多场景下表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DRLACP能有效处理不确定性，提升多车辆协同规划的效率和安全性。

Abstract: In future intelligent transportation systems, autonomous cooperative planning
(ACP), becomes a promising technique to increase the effectiveness and security
of multi-vehicle interactions. However, multiple uncertainties cannot be fully
addressed for existing ACP strategies, e.g. perception, planning, and
communication uncertainties. To address these, a novel deep reinforcement
learning-based autonomous cooperative planning (DRLACP) framework is proposed
to tackle various uncertainties on cooperative motion planning schemes.
Specifically, the soft actor-critic (SAC) with the implementation of gate
recurrent units (GRUs) is adopted to learn the deterministic optimal
time-varying actions with imperfect state information occurred by planning,
communication, and perception uncertainties. In addition, the real-time actions
of autonomous vehicles (AVs) are demonstrated via the Car Learning to Act
(CARLA) simulation platform. Evaluation results show that the proposed DRLACP
learns and performs cooperative planning effectively, which outperforms other
baseline methods under different scenarios with imperfect AV state information.

Abstract: Deploying humanoid robots to interact with real-world environments--such as
carrying objects or sitting on chairs--requires generalizable, lifelike motions
and robust scene perception. Although prior approaches have advanced each
capability individually, combining them in a unified system is still an ongoing
challenge. In this work, we present a physical-world humanoid-scene interaction
system, PhysHSI, that enables humanoids to autonomously perform diverse
interaction tasks while maintaining natural and lifelike behaviors. PhysHSI
comprises a simulation training pipeline and a real-world deployment system. In
simulation, we adopt adversarial motion prior-based policy learning to imitate
natural humanoid-scene interaction data across diverse scenarios, achieving
both generalization and lifelike behaviors. For real-world deployment, we
introduce a coarse-to-fine object localization module that combines LiDAR and
camera inputs to provide continuous and robust scene perception. We validate
PhysHSI on four representative interactive tasks--box carrying, sitting, lying,
and standing up--in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating
consistently high success rates, strong generalization across diverse task
goals, and natural motion patterns.

Result: 在nuPlan和interPlan数据集上，Flow Planner表现优于现有学习型方法。

Conclusion: Flow Planner有效建模复杂驾驶场景中的交互行为，性能达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Modeling interactive driving behaviors in complex scenarios remains a
fundamental challenge for autonomous driving planning. Learning-based
approaches attempt to address this challenge with advanced generative models,
removing the dependency on over-engineered architectures for representation
fusion. However, brute-force implementation by simply stacking transformer
blocks lacks a dedicated mechanism for modeling interactive behaviors that are
common in real driving scenarios. The scarcity of interactive driving data
further exacerbates this problem, leaving conventional imitation learning
methods ill-equipped to capture high-value interactive behaviors. We propose
Flow Planner, which tackles these problems through coordinated innovations in
data modeling, model architecture, and learning scheme. Specifically, we first
introduce fine-grained trajectory tokenization, which decomposes the trajectory
into overlapping segments to decrease the complexity of whole trajectory
modeling. With a sophisticatedly designed architecture, we achieve efficient
temporal and spatial fusion of planning and scene information, to better
capture interactive behaviors. In addition, the framework incorporates flow
matching with classifier-free guidance for multi-modal behavior generation,
which dynamically reweights agent interactions during inference to maintain
coherent response strategies, providing a critical boost for interactive
scenario understanding. Experimental results on the large-scale nuPlan dataset
and challenging interactive interPlan dataset demonstrate that Flow Planner
achieves state-of-the-art performance among learning-based approaches while
effectively modeling interactive behaviors in complex driving scenarios.

Motivation: 传统刚性外骨骼笨重且需要额外合规控制，而软外骨骼虽穿戴舒适但控制复杂。本文旨在解决软外骨骼的非线性人机交互动力学问题。

Method: 使用深度Koopman网络建模人机交互动力学，并结合模型预测控制（MPC）实现实时康复训练。

Result: 实验表明，结合EMG信号的Koopman模型显著提高了精度，个性化模型优于非个性化模型，控制框架优于传统PID控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为软康复机器人提供了一种新的控制框架，具有较高的应用潜力。

Abstract: Effective rehabilitation methods are essential for the recovery of lower limb
dysfunction caused by stroke. Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great
potentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are
usually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.
Moreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In
contrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic
compliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would
pose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic
actuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee
that is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and
enable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to
model the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the
electromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls
the pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model
accurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based
on the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to
control the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in
real-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given
reference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the
EMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to
great extent. In addition, a personalized Koopman model trained from the
individual's own data performs better than the non-personalized model.
Consequently, our control framework outperforms the traditional PID control in
both passive and active training modes. Hence the proposed method provides a
new control framework for soft rehabilitation robots.

Motivation: SO(3)的几何特性使其动作表示复杂，不同表示在强化学习中的表现尚不明确。

Method: 系统评估了SO(3)的多种动作表示（如欧拉角、四元数等）在PPO、SAC和TD3算法下的表现，分析了探索、熵正则化和训练稳定性。

Result: 局部切向量表示在算法中表现最可靠，几何特性显著影响探索和优化。

Conclusion: 提出了选择和使用旋转动作的实用指南，强调几何特性对强化学习的重要性。

Abstract: Many robotic control tasks require policies to act on orientations, yet the
geometry of SO(3) makes this nontrivial. Because SO(3) admits no global,
smooth, minimal parameterization, common representations such as Euler angles,
quaternions, rotation matrices, and Lie algebra coordinates introduce distinct
constraints and failure modes. While these trade-offs are well studied for
supervised learning, their implications for actions in reinforcement learning
remain unclear. We systematically evaluate SO(3) action representations across
three standard continuous control algorithms, PPO, SAC, and TD3, under dense
and sparse rewards. We compare how representations shape exploration, interact
with entropy regularization, and affect training stability through empirical
studies and analyze the implications of different projections for obtaining
valid rotations from Euclidean network outputs. Across a suite of robotics
benchmarks, we quantify the practical impact of these choices and distill
simple, implementation-ready guidelines for selecting and using rotation
actions. Our results highlight that representation-induced geometry strongly
influences exploration and optimization and show that representing actions as
tangent vectors in the local frame yields the most reliable results across
algorithms.

Abstract: Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1
robot equipped with an RGB-D camera validate the sim-to-real transferability of
DemoHLM, demonstrating robust performance under spatial variations across ten
loco-manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Rotor failures in quadrotors may result in high-speed rotation and vibration
due to rotor imbalance, which introduces significant challenges for autonomous
flight in unknown environments. The mainstream approaches against rotor
failures rely on fault-tolerant control (FTC) and predefined trajectory
tracking. To the best of our knowledge, online failure detection and diagnosis
(FDD), trajectory planning, and FTC of the post-failure quadrotors in unknown
and complex environments have not yet been achieved. This paper presents a
rotor-failure-aware quadrotor navigation system designed to mitigate the
impacts of rotor imbalance. First, a composite FDD-based nonlinear model
predictive controller (NMPC), incorporating motor dynamics, is designed to
ensure fast failure detection and flight stability. Second, a
rotor-failure-aware planner is designed to leverage FDD results and
spatial-temporal joint optimization, while a LiDAR-based quadrotor platform
with four anti-torque plates is designed to enable reliable perception under
high-speed rotation. Lastly, extensive benchmarks against state-of-the-art
methods highlight the superior performance of the proposed approach in
addressing rotor failures, including propeller unloading and motor stoppage.
The experimental results demonstrate, for the first time, that our approach
enables autonomous quadrotor flight with rotor failures in challenging
environments, including cluttered rooms and unknown forests.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂遮挡问题，提升了机器人跟随性能。

Abstract: Robot person following (RPF) is a core capability in human-robot interaction,
enabling robots to assist users in daily activities, collaborative work, and
other service scenarios. However, achieving practical RPF remains challenging
due to frequent occlusions, particularly in dynamic and crowded environments.
Existing approaches often rely on fixed-point following or sparse
candidate-point selection with oversimplified heuristics, which cannot
adequately handle complex occlusions caused by moving obstacles such as
pedestrians. To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive trajectory
sampling method that generates dense candidate points within socially aware
zones and evaluates them using a multi-objective cost function. Based on the
optimal point, a person-following trajectory is estimated relative to the
predicted motion of the target. We further design a prediction-aware model
predictive path integral (MPPI) controller that simultaneously tracks this
trajectory and proactively avoids collisions using predicted pedestrian
motions. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in smoothness, safety, robustness, and human
comfort, with its effectiveness further demonstrated on a mobile robot in
real-world scenarios.

Abstract: Effective generalization in robotic manipulation requires representations
that capture invariant patterns of interaction across environments and tasks.
We present a self-supervised framework for learning hierarchical manipulation
concepts that encode these invariant patterns through cross-modal sensory
correlations and multi-level temporal abstractions without requiring human
annotation. Our approach combines a cross-modal correlation network that
identifies persistent patterns across sensory modalities with a multi-horizon
predictor that organizes representations hierarchically across temporal scales.
Manipulation concepts learned through this dual structure enable policies to
focus on transferable relational patterns while maintaining awareness of both
immediate actions and longer-term goals. Empirical evaluation across simulated
benchmarks and real-world deployments demonstrates significant performance
improvements with our concept-enhanced policies. Analysis reveals that the
learned concepts resemble human-interpretable manipulation primitives despite
receiving no semantic supervision. This work advances both the understanding of
representation learning for manipulation and provides a practical approach to
enhancing robotic performance in complex scenarios.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for humanoid robots to execute

approach combines hierarchical planning, time-optimal standing position

hierarchical planning strategy, leveraging \ac{ik} and \ac{mip}, reduces
computational complexity by decoupling the high-dimensional planning problem. A
novel MIP formulation optimizes standing position selection and trajectory
length, minimizing task completion time. Furthermore, an MPC system with
simplified kinematics and single-step position correction ensures

orchestration and stable global communication. Latency evaluations conducted
under both local and international VPN scenarios (including Hong Kong, Japan,

total video latency under 1.2 seconds, even across high-latency networks. This
low-latency dual-protocol design ensures responsive closed-loop interaction and
robust performance in distributed environments. Unlike conventional

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速自动驾驶需要快速控制循环和严格的时间限制，但ROS 2及其DDS传输在共享计算单元时引入了高延迟。

Method: SIM通过共享内存、无锁双缓冲和原生内存布局优化数据传输，同时与ROS 2兼容。

Result: SIM将延迟降低高达98%，平均延迟降低95%，并显著提升自动驾驶系统的响应频率和安全性。

Conclusion: SIM为自动驾驶系统提供了一种高效的低延迟数据传输方案，显著提升了性能和安全距离。

Abstract: Ensuring safety in high-speed autonomous vehicles requires rapid control
loops and tightly bounded delays from perception to actuation. Many open-source
autonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control
nodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant
(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available
time budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport
designed for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data
in native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double
buffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into
ROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM
operates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness
and minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence
numbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,
liveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces
data-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such
as FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows
95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a
production-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased
localization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz. Applied across all
latency-critical modules, SIM cut average perception-to-decision latency from
521.91 ms to 290.26 ms, reducing emergency braking distance at 40 mph (64 km/h)
on dry concrete by 13.6 ft (4.14 m).

Abstract: Achieving mission objectives in a realistic simulation of aerial combat is
highly challenging due to imperfect situational awareness and nonlinear flight
dynamics. In this work, we introduce a novel 3D multi-agent air combat
environment and a Hierarchical Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning framework to
tackle these challenges. Our approach combines heterogeneous agent dynamics,
curriculum learning, league-play, and a newly adapted training algorithm. To
this end, the decision-making process is organized into two abstraction levels:
low-level policies learn precise control maneuvers, while high-level policies
issue tactical commands based on mission objectives. Empirical results show
that our hierarchical approach improves both learning efficiency and combat
performance in complex dogfight scenarios.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖单一策略联合优化奖励和安全性，可能导致不稳定，或使用需要先验知识的外部安全过滤器。

Method: 提出模块化成本感知调节器，基于预测的约束违规缩放动作，避免动作的退化抑制。

Result: 在Safety Gym运动任务中，约束违规减少126倍，回报提高一个数量级。

Conclusion: 该方法与离策略RL方法无缝集成，实现了最先进的回报-成本比。

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to mitigate unsafe behaviors that
arise from exploration during training by reducing constraint violations while
maintaining task performance. Existing approaches typically rely on a single
policy to jointly optimize reward and safety, which can cause instability due
to conflicting objectives, or they use external safety filters that override
actions and require prior system knowledge. In this paper, we propose a modular
cost-aware regulator that scales the agent's actions based on predicted
constraint violations, preserving exploration through smooth action modulation
rather than overriding the policy. The regulator is trained to minimize
constraint violations while avoiding degenerate suppression of actions. Our
approach integrates seamlessly with off-policy RL methods such as SAC and TD3,
and achieves state-of-the-art return-to-cost ratios on Safety Gym locomotion
tasks with sparse costs, reducing constraint violations by up to 126 times
while increasing returns by over an order of magnitude compared to prior
methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于双四元数的新型NMPC框架（DQ-NMPC），用于四旋翼飞行器的精确控制，显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四旋翼飞行器在复杂任务中具有潜力，但其精确控制仍面临挑战，主要由于其欠驱动特性和动力学耦合。

Method: 通过双四元数流形表示动力学和姿态误差，实现了紧凑且全局非奇异的控制框架。

Conclusion: DQ-NMPC在复杂环境中表现出优越性能，为四旋翼飞行器的精确控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: MAVs have great potential to assist humans in complex tasks, with
applications ranging from logistics to emergency response. Their agility makes
them ideal for operations in complex and dynamic environments. However,
achieving precise control in agile flights remains a significant challenge,
particularly due to the underactuated nature of quadrotors and the strong
coupling between their translational and rotational dynamics. In this work, we
propose a novel NMPC framework based on dual-quaternions (DQ-NMPC) for
quadrotor flight. By representing both quadrotor dynamics and the pose error
directly on the dual-quaternion manifold, our approach enables a compact and
globally non-singular formulation that captures the quadrotor coupled dynamics.
We validate our approach through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating better numerical conditioning and significantly improved tracking
performance, with reductions in position and orientation errors of up to 56.11%
and 56.77%, compared to a conventional baseline NMPC method. Furthermore, our
controller successfully handles aggressive trajectories, reaching maximum
speeds up to 13.66 m/s and accelerations reaching 4.2 g within confined space
conditions of dimensions 11m x 4.5m x 3.65m under which the baseline controller
fails.

Result: 在CiCross数据集上，IntersectioNDE在模拟保真度、稳定性和复杂交通动态复现方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IntersectioNDE为复杂城市交叉路口提供了更可靠的模拟环境，有助于提升自动驾驶系统的测试和验证。

Abstract: Realistic traffic simulation is critical for ensuring the safety and
reliability of autonomous vehicles (AVs), especially in complex and diverse
urban traffic environments. However, existing data-driven simulators face two
key challenges: a limited focus on modeling dense, heterogeneous interactions
at urban intersections - which are prevalent, crucial, and practically
significant in countries like China, featuring diverse agents including
motorized vehicles (MVs), non-motorized vehicles (NMVs), and pedestrians - and
the inherent difficulty in robustly learning high-dimensional joint
distributions for such high-density scenes, often leading to mode collapse and
long-term simulation instability. We introduce City Crossings Dataset
(CiCross), a large-scale dataset collected from a real-world urban
intersection, uniquely capturing dense, heterogeneous multi-agent interactions,
particularly with a substantial proportion of MVs, NMVs and pedestrians. Based
on this dataset, we propose IntersectioNDE (Intersection Naturalistic Driving
Environment), a data-driven simulator tailored for complex urban intersection
scenarios. Its core component is the Interaction Decoupling Strategy (IDS), a
training paradigm that learns compositional dynamics from agent subsets,
enabling the marginal-to-joint simulation. Integrated into a scene-aware
Transformer network with specialized training techniques, IDS significantly
enhances simulation robustness and long-term stability for modeling
heterogeneous interactions. Experiments on CiCross show that IntersectioNDE
outperforms baseline methods in simulation fidelity, stability, and its ability
to replicate complex, distribution-level urban traffic dynamics.

Conclusion: 该方法将状态估计、传感器和运动学校准统一为一个数据驱动的框架，适用于多种机器人平台。

Abstract: Accurate state estimation is critical for legged and aerial robots operating
in dynamic, uncertain environments. A key challenge lies in specifying process
and measurement noise covariances, which are typically unknown or manually
tuned. In this work, we introduce a bi-level optimization framework that
jointly calibrates covariance matrices and kinematic parameters in an
estimator-in-the-loop manner. The upper level treats noise covariances and
model parameters as optimization variables, while the lower level executes a
full-information estimator. Differentiating through the estimator allows direct
optimization of trajectory-level objectives, resulting in accurate and
consistent state estimates. We validate our approach on quadrupedal and
humanoid robots, demonstrating significantly improved estimation accuracy and
uncertainty calibration compared to hand-tuned baselines. Our method unifies
state estimation, sensor, and kinematics calibration into a principled,
data-driven framework applicable across diverse robotic platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: NaviGait结合轨迹优化和强化学习，实现更稳健和直观的双足运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在双足运动控制中表现强大，但奖励设计复杂且难以调整；而离线轨迹优化方法虽可调且数学基础强，但对现实扰动脆弱。

Method: NaviGait采用分层框架，利用离线优化的步态库生成连续参考运动，并通过策略提供关节和速度修正以稳定参考轨迹。

Result: NaviGait简化了奖励设计，训练更快，且运动更接近原始参考轨迹。

Conclusion: NaviGait通过解耦高层运动生成和低层修正，提供了更可扩展和通用的动态稳健运动控制方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method to learn robust
control policies for bipedal locomotion. Yet, it can be difficult to tune
desired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In
comparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,
offer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans
for high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain
brittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.
  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the
structure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and
intuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized
gaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference
motions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both
joint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize
the reference trajectories in the gait library. One notable advantage of
NaviGait is that it dramatically simplifies reward design by encoding rich
motion priors from trajectory optimization, reducing the need for finely tuned
shaping terms and enabling more stable and interpretable learning. Our
experimental results demonstrate that NaviGait enables faster training compared
to conventional and imitation-based RL, and produces motions that remain
closest to the original reference. Overall, by decoupling high-level motion
generation from low-level correction, NaviGait offers a more scalable and
generalizable approach for achieving dynamic and robust locomotion.

Conclusion: 这种全向机器人套件为教育机器人学提供了更广泛的应用可能性。

Abstract: Recent developments of low cost off-the-shelf programmable components, their
modularity, and also rapid prototyping made educational robotics flourish, as
it is accessible in most schools today. They allow to illustrate and embody
theoretical problems in practical and tangible applications, and gather
multidisciplinary skills. They also give a rich natural context for
project-oriented pedagogy. However, most current robot kits all are limited to
egocentric aspect of the robots perception. This makes it difficult to access
more high-level problems involving e.g. coordinates or navigation. In this
paper we introduce an educational holonomous robot kit that comes with an
external tracking system, which lightens the constraint on embedded systems,
but allows in the same time to discover high-level aspects of robotics,

Abstract: Scooping items with tools such as spoons and ladles is common in daily life,
ranging from assistive feeding to retrieving items from environmental disaster
sites. However, developing a general and autonomous robotic scooping policy is
challenging since it requires reasoning about complex tool-object interactions.
Furthermore, scooping often involves manipulating deformable objects, such as
granular media or liquids, which is challenging due to their
infinite-dimensional configuration spaces and complex dynamics. We propose a
method, SCOOP'D, which uses simulation from OmniGibson (built on NVIDIA
Omniverse) to collect scooping demonstrations using algorithmic procedures that
rely on privileged state information. Then, we use generative policies via
diffusion to imitate demonstrations from observational input. We directly apply
the learned policy in diverse real-world scenarios, testing its performance on
various item quantities, item characteristics, and container types. In
zero-shot deployment, our method demonstrates promising results across 465
trials in diverse scenarios, including objects of different difficulty levels
that we categorize as "Level 1" and "Level 2." SCOOP'D outperforms all
baselines and ablations, suggesting that this is a promising approach to
acquiring robotic scooping skills. Project page is at

Abstract: Accurate real-time estimation of end effector interaction forces in hydraulic
excavators is a key enabler for advanced automation in heavy machinery.
Accurate knowledge of these forces allows improved, precise grading and digging
maneuvers. To address these challenges, we introduce a high-accuracy,
retrofittable 2D force- and payload estimation algorithm that does not impose
additional requirements on the operator regarding trajectory, acceleration or
the use of the slew joint. The approach is designed for retrofittability,
requires minimal calibration and no prior knowledge of machine-specific dynamic
characteristics. Specifically, we propose a method for identifying a dynamic
model, necessary to estimate both end effector interaction forces and bucket
payload during normal operation. Our optimization-based payload estimation
achieves a full-scale payload accuracy of 1%. On a standard 25 t excavator, the
online force measurement from pressure and inertial measurements achieves a
direction accuracy of 13 degree and a magnitude accuracy of 383 N. The method's
accuracy and generalization capability are validated on two excavator platforms
of different type and weight classes. We benchmark our payload estimation
against a classical quasistatic method and a commercially available system. Our
system outperforms both in accuracy and precision.

Abstract: While Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated impressive

To address this, we introduce ManiAgent, an agentic architecture for general
manipulation tasks that achieves end-to-end output from task descriptions and

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化规划器难以处理接触复杂性，而在线强化学习样本效率低且多任务能力有限。

Conclusion: 该框架在数据效率和多任务能力上优于在线强化学习，适用于复杂接触任务。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to exploit physical contact, rather than simply
avoid collisions, is crucial for autonomy in unstructured environments.
Traditional optimization-based planners struggle with contact complexity, while
on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) is sample-inefficient and has limited
multi-task ability. We propose a framework combining a learned world model with
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC), trained on a demonstration-free
offline dataset to predict future outcomes in a compressed latent space. To
address sparse contact rewards and sensor noise, the MPC uses a learned
surrogate value function for dense, robust planning. Our single, scalable model
supports contact-aware tasks, including wall support after perturbation,
blocking incoming objects, and traversing height-limited arches, with improved
data efficiency and multi-task capability over on-policy RL. Deployed on a
physical humanoid, our system achieves robust, real-time contact planning from
proprioception and ego-centric depth images. Website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接在现实世界中训练机器人操作策略成本高且耗时，仿真训练的RL策略虽可扩展，但精确动力学的任务仍难以实现有效的仿真到现实迁移。

Method: Phys2Real包含三个核心组件：高保真几何重建、VLM推断的物理参数先验分布，以及基于交互数据的在线物理参数估计。

Conclusion: Phys2Real通过结合VLM和交互信息，成功解决了复杂任务的仿真到现实迁移问题。

Abstract: Learning robotic manipulation policies directly in the real world can be
expensive and time-consuming. While reinforcement learning (RL) policies
trained in simulation present a scalable alternative, effective sim-to-real
transfer remains challenging, particularly for tasks that require precise
dynamics. To address this, we propose Phys2Real, a real-to-sim-to-real RL
pipeline that combines vision-language model (VLM)-inferred physical parameter
estimates with interactive adaptation through uncertainty-aware fusion. Our
approach consists of three core components: (1) high-fidelity geometric
reconstruction with 3D Gaussian splatting, (2) VLM-inferred prior distributions
over physical parameters, and (3) online physical parameter estimation from
interaction data. Phys2Real conditions policies on interpretable physical
parameters, refining VLM predictions with online estimates via ensemble-based
uncertainty quantification. On planar pushing tasks of a T-block with varying
center of mass (CoM) and a hammer with an off-center mass distribution,
Phys2Real achieves substantial improvements over a domain randomization
baseline: 100% vs 79% success rate for the bottom-weighted T-block, 57% vs 23%
in the challenging top-weighted T-block, and 15% faster average task completion
for hammer pushing. Ablation studies indicate that the combination of VLM and
interaction information is essential for success. Project website:
