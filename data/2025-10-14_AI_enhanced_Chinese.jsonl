Furthermore, its interpretability\nand insightful decision-making process enhance its applicability in complex\nmedical scenarios. Evaluation of the proposed approach encompasses key metrics\nincluding Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and training and evaluation time. The\nmethodology resulted in an F1-score of up to 0.85 when using the complete\ntraining data, with an F1-score of 0.77 when utilizing 50\\% of the training\ndata. This shows a reduction of F1-score of 0.08 while in the reduction of 50\\%\nof the training data and training time. The evaluation of the methodology\nresulted in the 32 Frame per Second which is usable for the realtime\napplications.

This iterative\ndenoising process enables the model to correct fine structural inconsistencies\nand enhance tumor boundary delineation. Experiments conducted on the BraTS 2021\ndatasets demonstrate that NNDM achieves superior performance compared to\nconventional U-Net and transformer-based baselines, yielding improvements in\nDice coefficient and Hausdorff distance metrics. Moreover, the diffusion-guided\nrefinement enhances robustness across modalities and tumor subregions. The\nproposed NNDM establishes a new direction for combining deterministic\nsegmentation networks with stochastic diffusion models, advancing the state of\nthe art in automated brain tumor analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "NNDM\u7ed3\u5408NN-UNet\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8111\u80bf\u7624MRI\u5206\u5272\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CNN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6570\u636e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNNDM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316NN-UNet\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728BraTS 2021\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNNDM\u5728Dice\u7cfb\u6570\u548cHausdorff\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "NNDM\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u968f\u673a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Both of these processes are\nslow, costly, and difficult to scale. World models offer a promising, scalable\nalternative by enabling policies to rollout within imagination space. However,\na key challenge is building a controllable world model that can handle\nmulti-step interactions with generalist robot policies. This requires a world\nmodel compatible with modern generalist policies by supporting multi-view\nprediction, fine-grained action control, and consistent long-horizon\ninteractions, which is not achieved by previous works. In this paper, we make a\nstep forward by introducing a controllable multi-view world model that can be\nused to evaluate and improve the instruction-following ability of generalist\nrobot policies. Our model maintains long-horizon consistency with a\npose-conditioned memory retrieval mechanism and achieves precise action control\nthrough frame-level action conditioning. Trained on the DROID dataset (95k\ntrajectories, 564 scenes), our model generates spatially and temporally\nconsistent trajectories under novel scenarios and new camera placements for\nover 20 seconds. We show that our method can accurately rank policy performance\nwithout real-world robot rollouts. Moreover, by synthesizing successful\ntrajectories in imagination and using them for supervised fine-tuning, our\napproach can improve policy success by 44.7\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5904\u7406\u964c\u751f\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u59ff\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728DROID\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u751f\u621020\u79d2\u4ee5\u4e0a\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6210\u529f\u738744.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel\nsemantic cohesive knowledge distillation scheme for deep cross-modal hashing,\ndubbed as SODA. Specifically, the multi-label information is introduced as a\nnew textual modality and reformulated as a set of ground-truth label prompt,\ndepicting the semantics presented in the image like the text modality. Then, a\ncross-modal teacher network is devised to effectively distill cross-modal\nsemantic characteristics between image and label modalities and thus learn a\nwell-mapped Hamming space for image modality. In a sense, such Hamming space\ncan be regarded as a kind of prior knowledge to guide the learning of\ncross-modal student network and comprehensively preserve the semantic\nsimilarities between image and text modality.

While there are proposals to avoid redundant computation by\nreusing KV caches across queries and to increase GPU utilization by\ndisaggregating a single query to different engines, their promises cannot be\nrealized without efficiently offloading and communicating KV cache across LLM\ninference engines and queries.\n  We present LMCache, the first and so far the most efficient open-source KV\ncaching solution, which extracts and stores KV caches generated by modern LLM\nengines (vLLM and SGLang) and shares the KV caches across engines and queries.\nLMCache exposes KV caches in the LLM engine interface, effectively transforming\nLLM engines from individual token processors to a collection of engines with KV\ncache as the storage and communication medium. In particular, it supports both\ncache offloading (prefix reuse across queries) and prefill-decode\ndisaggregation (cross-engine cache transfer). LMCache's high performance and\nwide adoption stem from the following contributions: highly optimized KV cache\ndata movement with performance optimizations including batched data movement\noperations, compute and I/O pipelining; a modular KV cache connector component,\ndecoupling LMCache from the rapid evolution of inference engines; a first-class\ncontrol API, such as pinning, lookup, cleanup, movement, and compression, for\nflexible cache orchestration across GPU, CPU, storage, and network layers.\nEvaluation shows that combining LMCache with vLLM achieves up to 15x\nimprovement in throughput across diverse workloads.

To address this, we present Harmanoid , a dual-humanoid\nmotion imitation framework that transfers interacting human motions to two\nrobots while preserving both kinematic fidelity and physical realism. Harmanoid\ncomprises two key components: (i) contact-aware motion retargeting, which\nrestores inter-body coordination by aligning SMPL contacts with robot vertices,\nand (ii) interaction-driven motion controller, which leverages\ninteraction-specific rewards to enforce coordinated keypoints and physically\nplausible contacts. By explicitly modeling inter-agent contacts and\ninteraction-aware dynamics, Harmanoid captures the coupled behaviors between\nhumanoids that single-humanoid frameworks inherently overlook.

This simulation should allow researchers to experiment with\nthe robot and perform efficient learning-based control in diverse environments.\nWe provide the integration publicly at https://github.com/AIS-Bonn/tiago_isaac.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5728Isaac Sim\u4e2d\u4e3aPAL Robotics TIAGo++ Omni\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u662f\u5176\u5168\u5411\u9a71\u52a8\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4fTIAGo++ Omni\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728Isaac Sim\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u56e2\u961f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5168\u5411\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u786e\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u901f\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u5728Isaac Sim\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4e86TIAGo++ Omni\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u516c\u5f00\u4e86\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4eff\u771f\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In order to identify cell instances\nfrom foreground pixels (e.g., pixel clustering), most methods decompose\ninstance information into pixel-wise objectives, such as distances to\nforeground-background boundaries (distance maps), heat gradients with the\ncenter point as heat source (heat diffusion maps), and distances from the\ncenter point to foreground-background boundaries with fixed angles (star-shaped\npolygons). However, pixel-wise objectives may lose significant geometric\nproperties of the cell instances, such as shape, curvature, and convexity,\nwhich require a collection of pixels to represent. To address this challenge,\nwe present a novel pixel clustering method, called Ceb (for Cell boundaries),\nto leverage cell boundary features and labels to divide foreground pixels into\ncell instances. Starting with probability maps generated from semantic\nsegmentation, Ceb first extracts potential foreground-foreground boundaries\nwith a revised Watershed algorithm. For each boundary candidate, a boundary\nfeature representation (called boundary signature) is constructed by sampling\npixels from the current foreground-foreground boundary as well as the\nneighboring background-foreground boundaries. Next, a boundary classifier is\nused to predict its binary boundary label based on the corresponding boundary\nsignature. Finally, cell instances are obtained by dividing or merging\nneighboring regions based on the predicted boundary labels.

Video Summary: https://youtu.be/txYc9b1oflU", "summary": "Dynamic manipulation, such as robot tossing or throwing objects, has recently\ngained attention as a novel paradigm to speed up logistic operations. However,\nthe focus has predominantly been on the object's landing location, irrespective\nof its final orientation. In this work, we present a method enabling a robot to\naccurately \"throw-flip\" objects to a desired landing pose (position and\norientation). Conventionally, objects thrown by revolute robots suffer from\nparasitic rotation, resulting in highly restricted and uncontrollable landing\nposes. Our approach is based on two key design choices: first, leveraging the\nimpulse-momentum principle, we design a family of throwing motions that\neffectively decouple the parasitic rotation, significantly expanding the\nfeasible set of landing poses. Second, we combine a physics-based model of free\nflight with regression-based learning methods to account for unmodeled effects.\nReal robot experiments demonstrate that our framework can learn to throw-flip\nobjects to a pose target within ($\\pm$5 cm, $\\pm$45 degrees) threshold in\ndozens of trials. Thanks to data assimilation, incorporating projectile\ndynamics reduces sample complexity by an average of 40% when throw-flipping to\nunseen poses compared to end-to-end learning methods.

As the robot moves to track different\ntargets, the ones outside the field of view accumulate uncertainty, making them\nprogressively harder to track. An effective path planning algorithm must manage\nuncertainty over a long horizon and account for the risk of permanently losing\ntrack of targets that remain unseen for too long.

High-Fidelity Portrait Image Super-Resolution", "comment": null, "summary": "Portrait pictures, which typically feature both human subjects and natural\nbackgrounds, are one of the most prevalent forms of photography on social\nmedia. Existing image super-resolution (ISR) techniques generally focus either\non generic real-world images or strictly aligned facial images (i.e., face\nsuper-resolution). In practice, separate models are blended to handle portrait\nphotos: the face specialist model handles the face region, and the general\nmodel processes the rest. However, these blending approaches inevitably\nintroduce blending or boundary artifacts around the facial regions due to\ndifferent model training recipes, while human perception is particularly\nsensitive to facial fidelity. To overcome these limitations, we study the\nportrait image supersolution (PortraitISR) problem, and propose HeadsUp, a\nsingle-step diffusion model that is capable of seamlessly restoring and\nupscaling portrait images in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, we build our\nmodel on top of a single-step diffusion model and develop a face supervision\nmechanism to guide the model in focusing on the facial region.

In this paper, we present a\nrobotics-tailored exposition of Galilean symmetry that leverages the\ncommunity's familiarity with and understanding of rigid-body transformations\nand pose representations. Our approach contrasts with common treatments in the\nphysics literature that introduce Galilean symmetry as a stepping stone to\nEinstein's relativity. A key insight is that the Galilean matrix Lie group can\nbe used to describe two different pose representations, Galilean frames, that\nuse inertial velocity in the state definition, and extended poses, that use\ncoordinate velocity. We provide three examples where applying the Galilean\nmatrix Lie-group algebra to robotics problems is straightforward and yields\nsignificant insights: inertial navigation above the rotating Earth, manipulator\nkinematics, and sensor data fusion under temporal uncertainty.

Longitudinal Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nand other neuroimaging data are valuable for characterizing trajectories of\nchange associated with typical and atypical aging.

This leads to computational problems for most traditional deep\nlearning methods that cannot represent the underlying continuous biological\nprocess. To address these limitations, we present a new, fully data-driven\nmethod for representing aging trajectories across the entire brain by modelling\nsubject-specific longitudinal T1-weighted MRI data as continuous functions\nusing Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Therefore, we introduce a novel\nINR architecture capable of partially disentangling spatial and temporal\ntrajectory parameters and design an efficient framework that directly operates\non the INRs' parameter space to classify brain aging trajectories. To evaluate\nour method in a controlled data environment, we develop a biologically grounded\ntrajectory simulation and generate T1-weighted 3D MRI data for 450 healthy and\ndementia-like subjects at regularly and irregularly sampled timepoints.

Through\nanalysis of factors in this issue, this study identifies four key challenges\nthat affect the accuracy of Shatian pomelo detection: imaging devices, lighting\nconditions, object scale variation, and occlusion. To mitigate these\nchallenges, a multi-strategy framework is proposed in this paper.

Secondly, to simulate the inconsistent illumination\nconditions, specific data augmentations such as adjusting contrast and changing\nbrightness, are applied to the above dataset.

Artificial\nintelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these\nlimitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require\nlarge, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently\nstruggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient\nvariability and rare pathological cases.

Beyond compromising image quality, this\nstructured noise also affects high-level tasks, such as object detection and\ntracking, where reliable lighting is crucial. Despite the prevalence of\nflicker, the lack of a large-scale, realistic dataset has been a significant\nbarrier to advancing research in flicker removal. To address this issue, we\npresent BurstDeflicker, a scalable benchmark constructed using three\ncomplementary data acquisition strategies. First, we develop a Retinex-based\nsynthesis pipeline that redefines the goal of flicker removal and enables\ncontrollable manipulation of key flicker-related attributes (e.g., intensity,\narea, and frequency), thereby facilitating the generation of diverse flicker\npatterns.

Existing data-driven\nforecasting methods typically model atmospheric dynamics over a fixed short\ntime interval (e.g., 6 hours) and rely on naive autoregression-based rollout\nfor long-term forecasting (e.g., 138 hours). However, this paradigm suffers\nfrom two key limitations: (1) it often inadequately models the spatial and\nmulti-scale temporal dependencies inherent in global weather systems, and (2)\nthe rollout strategy struggles to balance error accumulation with the capture\nof fine-grained atmospheric variations. In this study, we propose ARROW, an\nAdaptive-Rollout Multi-scale temporal Routing method for Global Weather\nForecasting. To contend with the first limitation, we construct a\nmulti-interval forecasting model that forecasts weather across different time\nintervals. Within the model, the Shared-Private Mixture-of-Experts captures\nboth shared patterns and specific characteristics of atmospheric dynamics\nacross different time scales, while Ring Positional Encoding accurately encodes\nthe circular latitude structure of the Earth when representing spatial\ninformation.

In practice, annotators make mistakes, rare\ncategories are ambiguous, and conventional AL heuristics (uncertainty,\ndiversity) often amplify such errors by repeatedly selecting mislabeled or\nredundant samples. We propose Reliable Active Learning via Neural Collapse\nGeometry (NCAL-R), a framework that leverages the emergent geometric\nregularities of deep networks to counteract unreliable supervision. Our method\nintroduces two complementary signals: (i) a Class-Mean Alignment Perturbation\nscore, which quantifies how candidate samples structurally stabilize or distort\ninter-class geometry, and (ii) a Feature Fluctuation score, which captures\ntemporal instability of representations across training checkpoints. By\ncombining these signals, NCAL-R prioritizes samples that both preserve class\nseparation and highlight ambiguous regions, mitigating the effect of noisy or\nredundant labels. Experiments on ImageNet-100 and CIFAR100 show that NCAL-R\nconsistently outperforms standard AL baselines, achieving higher accuracy with\nfewer labels, improved robustness under synthetic label noise, and stronger\ngeneralization to out-of-distribution data. These results suggest that\nincorporating geometric reliability criteria into acquisition decisions can\nmake Active Learning less brittle to annotation errors and distribution shifts,\na key step toward trustworthy deployment in real-world labeling pipelines.

This field has seen\nsignificant progress with numerous CNN and Transformer-based methods enhancing\nthe segmentation accuracy and robustness. Traditional CNN approaches manage\naudio-visual interactions through basic operations like padding and\nmultiplications but are restricted by CNNs' limited local receptive field. More\nrecently, Transformer-based methods treat auditory cues as queries, utilizing\nattention mechanisms to enhance audio-visual cooperation within frames.\nNevertheless, they typically struggle to extract multimodal coefficients and\ntemporal dynamics adequately. To overcome these limitations, we present the\nComplementary and Contrastive Transformer (CCFormer), a novel framework adept\nat processing both local and global information and capturing spatial-temporal\ncontext comprehensively. Our CCFormer initiates with the Early Integration\nModule (EIM) that employs a parallel bilateral architecture, merging\nmulti-scale visual features with audio data to boost cross-modal\ncomplementarity.

Traditional Voronoi coverage control methods face three\ncritical limitations in emergency contexts: heterogeneous agent capabilities\nwith vastly different velocities, clustered initial deployment configurations,\nand urgent time constraints requiring rapid response rather than eventual\nconvergence. Our method addresses these challenges through a decoupled\ntwo-layer architecture that separately optimizes aerial and ground robot\npositioning, with aerial agents delivering ground sensors via airdrop to\nhigh-priority locations.

Recently, there has\nbeen a lot of focus on self-supervised pre-training methods through Masked\nAutoencoders (MAE) \\cite{he2022masked,bachmann2022multimae}, usually used as a\nfirst step before optimizing for a downstream task, such as classification or\nregression. This is very useful as it doesn't require any manually labeled\ndata. In this work, we introduce Probabilistic Hyper-Graphs using Masked\nAutoencoders (PHG-MAE): a novel model that unifies the classical work on neural\ngraphs \\cite{leordeanu2021semi} with the modern approach of masked autoencoders\nunder a common theoretical framework. Through random masking of entire\nmodalities, not just patches, the model samples from the distribution of\nhyper-edges on each forward pass. Additionally, the model adapts the standard\nMAE algorithm by combining pre-training and fine-tuning into a single training\nloop. Moreover, our approach enables the creation of inference-time ensembles\nwhich, through aggregation, boost the final prediction performance and\nconsistency. Lastly, we show that we can apply knowledge distillation on top of\nthe ensembles with little loss in performance, even with models that have fewer\nthan 1M parameters. While our work mostly focuses on outdoor UAV scenes that\ncontain multiple world interpretations and modalities, the same steps can be\nfollowed in other similar domains, such as autonomous driving or indoor\nrobotics.

To\naddress this problem, this study proposes a novel and universal framework for\ntracking the spatiotemporal evolution of large-scale landslide scars using a\nvision foundation model.

The proposed framework operates within a knowledge-guided,\nauto-propagation, and interactive refinement paradigm to ensure the continuous\nand accurate identification of landslide scars. The proposed framework was\nvalidated through application to two representative cases: the post-failure\nBaige landslide and the active Sela landslide (2017-2025).

Conventional post-detection methods such as Non-Maximum Suppression\nand Soft-NMS rely only on spatial overlap, which can suppress true positives or\nretain false alarms in cluttered or ambiguous fire scenes. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an uncertainty aware post-detection framework that\nrescales detection confidences using both statistical uncertainty and domain\nrelevant visual cues. A lightweight Confidence Refinement Network integrates\nuncertainty estimates with color, edge, and texture features to adjust\ndetection scores without modifying the base model. Experiments on the D-Fire\ndataset demonstrate improved precision, recall, and mean average precision\ncompared to existing baselines, with only modest computational overhead.

Many researchers have worked on\ndeveloping gesture-based PD recognition systems; however, their performance\naccuracy is not satisfactory. In this study, we propose a multi-class Parkinson\nDisease detection system based on finger tapping using an attention-enhanced\nCNN BiLSTM. We collected finger tapping videos and derived temporal, frequency,\nand amplitude based features from wrist and hand movements. Then, we proposed a\nhybrid deep learning framework integrating CNN, BiLSTM, and attention\nmechanisms for multi-class PD severity classification from video-derived motion\nfeatures. First, the input sequence is reshaped and passed through a Conv1D\nMaxPooling block to capture local spatial dependencies. The resulting feature\nmaps are fed into a BiLSTM layer to model temporal dynamics.

However, the cluttered\nnature of indoor environments often introduces severe magnetic disturbances,\nwhich can significantly degrade heading accuracy. To address this challenge,\nthis paper presents an Adaptive MARG-Only Heading (AMO-HEAD) estimation\napproach for UAVs operating in magnetically disturbed environments. AMO-HEAD is\na lightweight and computationally efficient Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)\nframework that leverages inertial and magnetic sensors to achieve reliable\nheading estimation.

An adaptive process noise\ncovariance method is introduced to model and compensate for gyroscope\nmeasurement noise, bias drift, and discretization errors arising from the Euler\nmethod integration. To mitigate the effects of external magnetic disturbances,\na scaling factor is applied based on real-time magnetic deviation detection.

In contrast to existing methods that focus solely on\nstatic scenarios and enforce multi-view consistency by averaging color\nvariations which inevitably sacrifice both chromatic richness and\ncontrollability, our approach is able to preserve color diversity and\nsteerability while ensuring cross-view and cross-time consistency. In\nparticular, the core insight of our method is to colorize only a single key\nview and then fine-tune a personalized colorizer to propagate its color to\nnovel views and time steps. Through personalization, the colorizer learns a\nscene-specific deterministic color mapping underlying the reference view,\nenabling it to consistently project corresponding colors to the content in\nnovel views and video frames via its inherent inductive bias. Once trained, the\npersonalized colorizer can be applied to infer consistent chrominance for all\nother images, enabling direct reconstruction of colorful 3D scenes with a\ndedicated Lab color space Gaussian splatting representation. The proposed\nframework ingeniously recasts complicated 3D colorization as a more tractable\nsingle image paradigm, allowing seamless integration of arbitrary image\ncolorization models with enhanced flexibility and controllability.

However, existing methods rarely unify these tasks within a single\nframework. Generation-based approaches struggle with fine-grained identity\nconsistency across instances, while editing-based methods often lose spatial\ncontrollability and instruction alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose\nReMix, a unified framework for character-consistent generation and editing. It\nconstitutes two core components: the ReMix Module and IP-ControlNet. The ReMix\nModule leverages the multimodal reasoning ability of MLLMs to edit semantic\nfeatures of input images and adapt instruction embeddings to the native DiT\nbackbone without fine-tuning. While this ensures coherent semantic layouts,\npixel-level consistency and pose controllability remain challenging. To address\nthis, IP-ControlNet extends ControlNet to decouple semantic and layout cues\nfrom reference images and introduces an {\\epsilon}-equivariant latent space\nthat jointly denoises the reference and target images within a shared noise\nspace.

Nowadays, robotic exoskeletons have shown great\npotentials in rehabilitation. Nevertheless, traditional rigid exoskeletons are\nusually heavy and need a lot of work to help the patients to put them on.\nMoreover, it also requires extra compliance control to guarantee the safety. In\ncontrast, soft exoskeletons are easy and comfortable to wear and have intrinsic\ncompliance, but their complex nonlinear human-robot interaction dynamics would\npose significant challenges for control. In this work, based on the pneumatic\nactuators inspired by origami, we design a rehabilitation exoskeleton for knee\nthat is easy and comfortable to wear. To guarantee the control performance and\nenable a nice human-robot interaction, we first use Deep Koopman Network to\nmodel the human-robot interaction dynamics. In particular, by viewing the\nelectromyography (EMG) signals and the duty cycle of the PWM wave that controls\nthe pneumatic robot's valves and pump as the inputs, the linear Koopman model\naccurately captures the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. Next, based\non the obtained Koopman model, we further use Model Predictive Control (MPC) to\ncontrol the soft robot and help the user to do rehabilitation training in\nreal-time. The goal of the rehabilitation training is to track a given\nreference signal shown on the screen. Experiments show that by integrating the\nEMG signals into the Koopman model, we have improved the model accuracy to\ngreat extent. In addition, a personalized Koopman model trained from the\nindividual's own data performs better than the non-personalized model.\nConsequently, our control framework outperforms the traditional PID control in\nboth passive and active training modes.

However, existing continuous-time methods face\nthree key challenges: (1) some methods depend solely on node-specific memory\nwithout effectively incorporating information from neighboring nodes, resulting\nin embedding staleness; (2) most fail to explicitly capture correlations\nbetween node neighborhoods, limiting contextual awareness; and (3) many fail to\nfully capture the structural dynamics of evolving graphs, especially in absence\nof rich link attributes. To address these limitations, we introduce TAWRMAC-a\nnovel framework that integrates Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart, Memory\nAugmentation, and Neighbor Co-occurrence embedding. TAWRMAC enhances embedding\nstability through a memory-augmented GNN with fixedtime encoding and improves\ncontextual representation by explicitly capturing neighbor correlations.\nAdditionally, its Temporal Anonymous Walks with Restart mechanism distinguishes\nbetween nodes exhibiting repetitive interactions and those forming new\nconnections beyond their immediate neighborhood. This approach captures\nstructural dynamics better and supports strong inductive learning. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that TAWRMAC\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in dynamic link prediction\nand node classification under both transductive and inductive settings across\nthree different negative sampling strategies.

Using Huber\nregression as a close-up example within Tikhonov-regularized risk minimization\nin reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS), we address two central challenges:\n(i) the breakdown of standard concentration tools under weak moment\nassumptions, and (ii) the analytical difficulties introduced by unbounded\nhypothesis spaces. Our first message is conceptual: conventional\ngeneralization-error bounds for robust losses do not faithfully capture\nout-of-sample performance. We argue that learnability should instead be\nquantified through prediction error, namely the $L_2$-distance to the truth\n$f^\\star$, which is $\\sigma$-independent and directly reflects the target of\nrobust estimation.

We also introduce three metrics tailored\nto PyTorch to JAX: T2J CodeTrans Score, T2J FixCost Score (an LLM-based\nestimate of bug-fix effort), and T2J Comparison Score (LLM-as-judge).\nEmpirically, T2J raises GPT-4o-mini performance by up to 10% on CodeBLEU, 50%\non T2J FixCost Score, 1.33 points on T2J CodeTrans Score (0--4 scale), and 100%\non T2J Comparison Score; moreover, the generated code runs up to 2.5x faster\nthan the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "T2J\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728PyTorch\u5230JAX\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "PyTorch\u548cJAX\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u751f\u6001\u6210\u719f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u4ee3\u7801\u5e93\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "T2J\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u96c6PyTorch\u4ee3\u7801\u3001\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cbJAX\u8349\u6848\u3001\u4e13\u4e1a\u5f00\u53d1\u8005\u4fee\u590d\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f18\u5316LLM\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "T2J\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86GPT-4o-mini\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCodeBLEU\u63d0\u534710%\uff0c\u4fee\u590d\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e50%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53472.5\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "T2J\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PyTorch\u5230JAX\u7ffb\u8bd1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u6846\u67b6\u4ee3\u7801\u7ffb\u8bd1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Many open-source\nautonomy systems rely on ROS 2 middleware; when multiple sensor and control\nnodes share one compute unit, ROS 2 and its DDS transports add significant\n(de)serialization, copying, and discovery overheads, shrinking the available\ntime budget. We present Sensor-in-Memory (SIM), a shared-memory transport\ndesigned for intra-host pipelines in autonomous vehicles. SIM keeps sensor data\nin native memory layouts (e.g., cv::Mat, PCL), uses lock-free bounded double\nbuffers that overwrite old data to prioritize freshness, and integrates into\nROS 2 nodes with four lines of code. Unlike traditional middleware, SIM\noperates beside ROS 2 and is optimized for applications where data freshness\nand minimal latency outweigh guaranteed completeness. SIM provides sequence\nnumbers, a writer heartbeat, and optional checksums to ensure ordering,\nliveness, and basic integrity. On an NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, SIM reduces\ndata-transport latency by up to 98% compared to ROS 2 zero-copy transports such\nas FastRTPS and Zenoh, lowers mean latency by about 95%, and narrows\n95th/99th-percentile tail latencies by around 96%. In tests on a\nproduction-ready Level 4 vehicle running Autoware.Universe, SIM increased\nlocalization frequency from 7.5 Hz to 9.5 Hz.

We begin by presenting the foundational theoretical concepts of\nCVCNNs, including complex convolutions, pooling layers, Wirtinger-based\ndifferentiation, and various complex-valued activation functions. These are\ncomplemented by critical adaptations of training techniques, including complex\nbatch normalization and weight initialization schemes, to ensure stability in\ntraining dynamics. Empirical evaluations are conducted across three stages.\nFirst, CVCNNs are benchmarked on standard image datasets, where they\ndemonstrate competitive performance with real-valued CNNs, even under synthetic\ncomplex perturbations. Although our focus is audio signal processing, we first\nevaluate CVCNNs on image datasets to establish baseline performance and\nvalidate training stability before applying them to audio tasks. In the second\nexperiment, we focus on audio classification using Mel-Frequency Cepstral\nCoefficients (MFCCs). CVCNNs trained on real-valued MFCCs slightly outperform\nreal CNNs, while preserving phase in input workflows highlights challenges in\nexploiting phase without architectural modifications.

Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets,\nSAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc\nsegmentation under cross-dataset training conditions.

Yet, it can be difficult to tune\ndesired robot behaviors due to unintuitive and complex reward design. In\ncomparison, offline trajectory optimization methods, like Hybrid Zero Dynamics,\noffer more tuneable, interpretable, and mathematically grounded motion plans\nfor high-dimensional legged systems. However, these methods often remain\nbrittle to real-world disturbances like external perturbations.\n  In this work, we present NaviGait, a hierarchical framework that combines the\nstructure of trajectory optimization with the adaptability of RL for robust and\nintuitive locomotion control. NaviGait leverages a library of offline-optimized\ngaits and smoothly interpolates between them to produce continuous reference\nmotions in response to high-level commands. The policy provides both\njoint-level and velocity command residual corrections to modulate and stabilize\nthe reference trajectories in the gait library.

An interesting aspect of software systems is that they\ncan be represented as different types of graphs, depending on the extraction\ngoals and priorities. For example, function calls within the software can be\ncaptured to create function call graphs, which highlight the relationships\nbetween functions and their dependencies. Alternatively, the processes spawned\nby the software can be modeled to generate process interaction graphs, which\nfocus on runtime behavior and inter-process communication. While these graph\nrepresentations are related, each captures a distinct perspective of the\nsystem, providing complementary insights into its structure and operation.\nWhile previous studies have leveraged graph neural networks (GNNs) to analyze\nsoftware behaviors, most of this work has focused on a single type of graph\nrepresentation. The joint modeling of both function call graphs and process\ninteraction graphs remains largely underexplored, leaving opportunities for\ndeeper, multi-perspective analysis of software systems.

These networks effortlessly identify and select\nfeatures in a non-intuitive data-driven manner, making it difficult to\ndetermine which features were most influential. That leads to a ``black box\",\nwhere users cannot know how the image data are analyzed but rely on empirical\nresults. Therefore the decision-making process can be biased by background\ninformation that is difficult to detect. Here we discuss examples of such\nhidden biases and propose techniques for identifying them, methods to\ndistinguish between contextual information and background noise, and explore\nwhether CNNs learn from irrelevant features. One effective approach to identify\ndataset bias is to classify blank background parts of the images. However, in\nsome situations a blank background in the images is not available, making it\nmore difficult to separate the foreground information from the blank\nbackground. Such parts of the image can also be considered contextual learning,\nnot necessarily bias. To overcome this, we propose two approaches that were\ntested on six different datasets, including natural, synthetic, and hybrid\ndatasets. The first method involves dividing images into smaller,\nnon-overlapping tiles of various sizes, which are then shuffled randomly,\nmaking classification more challenging. The second method involves the\napplication of several image transforms, including Fourier, Wavelet transforms,\nand Median filter, and their combinations. These transforms help recover\nbackground noise information used by CNN to classify images. Results indicate\nthat this method can effectively distinguish between contextual information and\nbackground noise, and alert on the presence of background noise even without\nthe need to use background information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86CNN\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u8bc6\u522b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86CNN\u662f\u5426\u4ece\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eCNN\u7684\u975e\u76f4\u89c2\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u80fd\u53d7\u5230\u96be\u4ee5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u504f\u89c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u5c0f\u56fe\u5757\uff1b2) \u5e94\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u5982\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u53d8\u6362\u3001\u5c0f\u6ce2\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u4e2d\u503c\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff09\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u533a\u5206\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u80cc\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63ed\u793aCNN\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We introduce a new fine-tuning\nstrategy, STAT, to train such a student model by using the metacognition\nability of a stronger large language model (LLM) as the teacher. The teacher\nuses the task dataset to create a list of skills needed for the task, and then\nlabels each data point with its required skills (Didolkar et al., 2024). By\nmonitoring the student's answers, the teacher creates a Missing-Skill-Profile\nfor the student, tracking how often they failed to apply each skill in their\nresponses. We use this idea to build a modified training set in one of two\nways. In STAT-Sel, the teacher uses an existing set of training examples but\nadaptively reweights them according to the Missing-Skill-Profile. In STAT-Syn,\nthe teacher synthesizes additional examples involving missing skills. Across\nextensive experiments on Llama and Qwen models, our methods yield improvements\nof up to 7.5% on MATH, whereas SFT provides only limited gains. Furthermore,\nSTAT enhances performance on out-of-distribution benchmarks (e.g., AIME24/25,\nAMC23, etc.) by an average of 4.6%. Crucially, we find that STAT is\ncomplementary to RL via GRPO (Shao et al., 2024): after the model is improved\nusing STAT to address skill gaps, GRPO continues to add further gains.

However, these methods often\nstruggle with viewpoint variations, occlusions, and noise. Multi-modal\napproaches that incorporate 3D body shape information offer improved robustness\nbut are computationally expensive, limiting their feasibility for real-time\napplications. To address these challenges, we introduce Mesh-Gait, a novel\nend-to-end multi-modal gait recognition framework that directly reconstructs 3D\nrepresentations from 2D silhouettes, effectively combining the strengths of\nboth modalities. Compared to existing methods, directly learning 3D features\nfrom 3D joints or meshes is complex and difficult to fuse with silhouette-based\ngait features. To overcome this, Mesh-Gait reconstructs 3D heatmaps as an\nintermediate representation, enabling the model to effectively capture 3D\ngeometric information while maintaining simplicity and computational\nefficiency. During training, the intermediate 3D heatmaps are gradually\nreconstructed and become increasingly accurate under supervised learning, where\nthe loss is calculated between the reconstructed 3D joints, virtual markers,\nand 3D meshes and their corresponding ground truth, ensuring precise spatial\nalignment and consistent 3D structure. Mesh-Gait extracts discriminative\nfeatures from both silhouettes and reconstructed 3D heatmaps in a\ncomputationally efficient manner. This design enables the model to capture\nspatial and structural gait characteristics while avoiding the heavy overhead\nof direct 3D reconstruction from RGB videos, allowing the network to focus on\nmotion dynamics rather than irrelevant visual details.

While CNNs are effective at capturing\nlocal patterns, they struggle with long-range dependencies due to their limited\nreceptive fields.

Existing KV\ncache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires\nidentical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct\nprecomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and\nrepeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially\naddress these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This\npaper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and\nhigh generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit\nsimilar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model\nfor generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for\nrestoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response\nquality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:\n(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache\nrecomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection\naccuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)\ngrouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.\nExperiments show CacheClip retains up to 94.8% and 85.0% of full-attention\nperformance on NIAH and LongBench, outperforming APE and CacheBlend by 25.2%\nand 35.1% on NIAH (with reomp% = 20%).

In\nthis paper, we investigate their vulnerability to adversarial attacks, where\nsubtle perturbations to the upstream weather forecasts can alter the downstream\nTC trajectory predictions. Although research on adversarial attacks in DLWF\nmodels has grown recently, generating perturbed upstream forecasts that\nreliably steer downstream output toward attacker-specified trajectories remains\na challenge. First, conventional TC detection systems are opaque,\nnon-differentiable black boxes, making standard gradient-based attacks\ninfeasible. Second, the extreme rarity of TC events leads to severe class\nimbalance problem, making it difficult to develop efficient attack methods that\nwill produce the attacker's target trajectories. Furthermore, maintaining\nphysical consistency in adversarially generated forecasts presents another\nsignificant challenge. To overcome these limitations, we propose Cyc-Attack, a\nnovel method that perturbs the upstream forecasts of DLWF models to generate\nadversarial trajectories.

To advance toward the ultimate goal of universal modeling, recent\nresearch has focused on developing a unified tokenizer. However, existing\ntokenizers face a significant performance trade-off between understanding and\ngeneration, stemming from the inherent conflict between high-level semantic\nabstraction and low-level pixel reconstruction. To tackle this challenge, we\npropose a generic and unified tokenizer, namely UniFlow, by flexibly adapting\nany visual encoder with a concise reconstruction decoder. Specifically, we\nintroduce layer-wise adaptive self-distillation applied to the well-pretrained\nvisual encoders, which enables UniFlow to simultaneously inherit the strong\nsemantic features for visual understanding and flexibly adapt to model\nfine-grained details for visual generation. Moreover, we propose a lightweight\npatch-wise pixel flow decoder, which efficiently achieves high-fidelity pixel\nreconstruction by modeling a conditional flow from the noisy state back to the\npatch-wise pixel domain. By leveraging the semantic features as visual\nconditions for the decoder, we effectively alleviate the training conflicts\nbetween understanding and generation. Furthermore, the patch-wise learning\nstrategy simplifies the data distribution, thereby improving training\nefficiency. Extensive experiments across 13 challenging benchmarks spanning 7\nwidely studied visual understanding and generation tasks demonstrate that\nUniFlow achieves a win-win outcome. For instance, our 7B UniFlow-XL not only\nsurpasses the 14B TokenFlow-XL by 7.75% on average understanding benchmarks,\nbut also achieves competitive results in both visual reconstruction and\ngeneration, surpassing UniTok by 0.15 in rFID and 0.09 in gFID (without\nguidance), respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "UniFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u50cf\u7d20\u6d41\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u51b2\u7a81\uff0cUniFlow\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u50cf\u7d20\u6d41\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c7B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a14B\u6a21\u578b7.75%\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e5f\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "UniFlow\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cc\u8d62\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

These conditions lead to weakened\ntexture and amplified noise and deteriorate the appearance saturation and\nboundary completeness of frame cameras, which are necessary for motion feature\nmatching. In degraded scenes, the frame camera provides dense appearance\nsaturation but sparse boundary completeness due to its long imaging time and\nlow dynamic range. In contrast, the event camera offers sparse appearance\nsaturation, while its short imaging time and high dynamic range gives rise to\ndense boundary completeness. Traditionally, existing methods utilize feature\nfusion or domain adaptation to introduce event to improve boundary\ncompleteness.

We\npropose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss\nbut an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during\npre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a\nlong-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information\n(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this\nU-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are\ntrained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term\nand short-term memory demands.

Recent approaches leverage diffusion\nmodels for step-by-step generation, yet unconditional diffusion offers little\ncontrol over desired properties, often leading to unstable quality and\ndifficulty in incorporating new objectives. Inference-time guidance methods\nmitigate these issues by adjusting the sampling process without retraining, but\nthey remain inherently local, heuristic, and limited in controllability. To\novercome these limitations, we propose TreeDiff, a Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) guided dual-space diffusion framework for controllable graph generation.\nTreeDiff is a plug-and-play inference-time method that expands the search space\nwhile keeping computation tractable. Specifically, TreeDiff introduces three\nkey designs to make it practical and scalable: (1) a macro-step expansion\nstrategy that groups multiple denoising updates into a single transition,\nreducing tree depth and enabling long-horizon exploration; (2) a dual-space\ndenoising mechanism that couples efficient latent-space denoising with\nlightweight discrete correction in graph space, ensuring both scalability and\nstructural fidelity; and (3) a dual-space verifier that predicts long-term\nrewards from partially denoised graphs, enabling early value estimation and\nremoving the need for full rollouts.

Recent work has introduced\nmulti-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a\nsingle model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility,\nquantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency\nimproves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and\nactivates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present\nAnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded\nQuantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing\nweights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables\nbit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly,\nbit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism\nincrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary\ncodes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are\nenabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ\nstructure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible\noverhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly\nnarrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains\ncompetitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x\nover half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods.

Existing kernel-based approaches\noften test the relative similarity with a fixed kernel in a manually specified\nalternative hypothesis, e.g., Q is closer to U than P. Although kernel\nselection is known to be important to kernel-based testing methods, the\nmanually specified hypothesis poses a significant challenge for kernel\nselection in relative similarity testing: Once the hypothesis is specified\nfirst, we can always find a kernel such that the hypothesis is rejected. This\nchallenge makes relative similarity testing ill-defined when we want to select\na good kernel after the hypothesis is specified.

Our model demonstrates notable improvements over existing\nGAN-based and recent diffusion-based frameworks - improved customization,\ncolor-matching capabilities, identity preservation and compatibility with\ntextual descriptions or LLMs with affordable computational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamMakeup\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5316\u5986\u5b9a\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GANs\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u7403\u5316\u5986\u54c1\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u865a\u62df\u5316\u5986\u6a21\u62df\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46GANs\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u5b9a\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DreamMakeup\u91c7\u7528\u65e9\u671f\u505c\u6b62\u7684DDIM\u53cd\u6f14\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u9762\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u3001RGB\u989c\u8272\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7684GAN\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0cDreamMakeup\u5728\u5b9a\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u989c\u8272\u5339\u914d\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6216LLMs\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamMakeup\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5316\u5986\u5b9a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While these priors improve reconstruction quality\nwith fewer measurements, they risk hallucinating features when test images lie\noutside the training distribution. Existing uncertainty quantification methods\nin this setting (i) require an in-distribution calibration dataset, which may\nnot be available, (ii) provide heuristic rather than statistical estimates, or\n(iii) quantify uncertainty from model capacity or limited measurements rather\nthan distribution shift. We propose an instance-level, calibration-free\nuncertainty indicator that is sensitive to distribution shift, requires no\nknowledge of the training distribution, and incurs no retraining cost. Our key\nhypothesis is that reconstructions of in-distribution images remain stable\nunder random measurement variations, while reconstructions of\nout-of-distribution (OOD) images exhibit greater instability. We use this\nstability as a proxy for detecting distribution shift.

Black-box methods presume access only to the\nmodel's outputs and often rely on training auxiliary reference models. While\nthey have shown strong empirical performance, they rely on assumptions that\nrarely hold in real-world settings: (i) the attacker knows the training\nhyperparameters; (ii) all available non-training samples come from the same\ndistribution as the training data; and (iii) the fraction of training data in\nthe evaluation set is known. In this paper, we demonstrate that removing these\nassumptions leads to a significant drop in the performance of black-box\nattacks.

Building on maximum-margin implicit bias theory, ImpMIA uses the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions to identify training samples.\nThis is done by finding the samples whose gradients most strongly reconstruct\nthe trained model's parameters.

To measure the performance of retrosynthesis\nsystems, we propose a novel evaluation protocol for reactions and synthetic\npaths based on a structured review by expert chemists. Using this protocol, we\ncompare systems on a set of 32 novel targets, curated to reflect recent trends\nin drug structures. While the insights behind our methodology are broadly\napplicable to retrosynthesis, our focus is on targets in the drug-like domain.\nBy releasing our benchmark targets and the details of our evaluation protocol,\nwe hope to inspire further research into reliable retrosynthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "RetroTrim\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u907f\u514d\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u5408\u6210\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u9006\u5408\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u53cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u9006\u5408\u6210\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u8bc4\u5206\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5e7b\u89c9\u53cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "RetroTrim\u662f\u552f\u4e00\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5e7b\u89c9\u53cd\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u91cf\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "RetroTrim\u4e3a\u9006\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u63a8\u52a8\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Recently, generative networks have been\nincreasingly employed to synthesize new data that closely resembles the\noriginal datasets. However, the appropriate size and depth of generative\nnetworks required to generate data with a specified tree edit distance remain\nunclear. In this paper, we theoretically establish the existence and\nconstruction of generative networks capable of producing trees similar to a\ngiven tree with respect to the tree edit distance. Specifically, for a given\nrooted, ordered, and vertex-labeled tree T of size n + 1 with labels from an\nalphabet \\Sigma, and a non-negative integer d, we prove that all rooted,\nordered, and vertex-labeled trees over \\Sigma with tree edit distance at most d\nfrom T can be generated using a ReLU-based generative network with size O(n^3 )\nand constant depth. The proposed networks were implemented and evaluated for\ngenerating trees with up to 21 nodes. Due to their deterministic architecture,\nthe networks successfully generated all valid trees within the specified tree\nedit distance. In contrast, state-of-the-art graph generative models GraphRNN\nand GraphGDP, which rely on non-deterministic mechanisms, produced\nsignificantly fewer valid trees, achieving validation rates of only up to 35%\nand 48%, respectively.

To this end, we introduce \\textbf{GIR-Bench}, a comprehensive\nbenchmark that evaluates unified models across three complementary\nperspectives. Firstly, we investigate understanding-generation consistency\n(GIR-Bench-UGC), asking whether models can consistently leverage the same\nknowledge in both understanding and generation tasks. Secondly, we investigate\nwhether models can perform reasoning-centric text-to-image generation that\nrequires applying logical constraints and implicit knowledge to generate\nfaithful visual content (GIR-Bench-T2I).

Building on this foundation, we\nintroduce two new methods, $\\texttt{MuAdam}$ and $\\texttt{MuAdam-SANIA}$, which\ncombine the spectral geometry of Muon with Adam-style preconditioning. Our\nexperiments demonstrate that these optimizers are competitive with, and in some\ncases outperform, existing state-of-the-art methods.

Instead of applying\nexplainability to the model's behavior, we seek to gain a better understanding\nof the problem itself. To this end, we propose a novel model that integrates an\noptimized pruning mechanism capable of removing nodes from the graph during the\ntraining process, rather than doing so as a separate procedure. This\nintegration allows the architecture to learn how to minimize prediction error\nwhile selecting the most relevant nodes. Thus, during training, the model\nsearches for the most relevant subset of nodes, obtaining the most important\nelements of the problem, facilitating its analysis. To evaluate the proposed\napproach, we used several widely used traffic datasets, comparing the accuracy\nobtained by pruning with the model and with other methods.

Due to privacy concerns, data providers typically\nanonymize datasets before sharing them; however, the existence of multiple\nmasking configurations results in masked datasets with varying utility.\nConsequently, a key challenge lies in efficiently determining the optimal\nmasking configuration that maximizes a dataset's utility. This paper presents\nAEGIS, a middleware framework for identifying the optimal masking configuration\nfor machine learning datasets that consist of features and a class label. We\nintroduce a utility optimizer that minimizes predictive utility deviation -- a\nmetric based on the changes in feature-label correlations before and after\nmasking.

While these approaches have shown promise, they often\noperate under a one-shot paradigm that relies heavily on the current scene\ncontext, potentially underestimating the importance of scene dynamics and their\ntemporal evolution. This limitation restricts the model's ability to make\ninformed and adaptive decisions in complex driving scenarios. We propose a new\nperspective: the future trajectory of an autonomous vehicle is closely\nintertwined with the evolving dynamics of its environment, and conversely, the\nvehicle's own future states can influence how the surrounding scene unfolds.\nMotivated by this bidirectional relationship, we introduce SeerDrive, a novel\nend-to-end framework that jointly models future scene evolution and trajectory\nplanning in a closed-loop manner. Our method first predicts future bird's-eye\nview (BEV) representations to anticipate the dynamics of the surrounding scene,\nthen leverages this foresight to generate future-context-aware trajectories.\nTwo key components enable this: (1) future-aware planning, which injects\npredicted BEV features into the trajectory planner, and (2) iterative scene\nmodeling and vehicle planning, which refines both future scene prediction and\ntrajectory generation through collaborative optimization. Extensive experiments\non the NAVSIM and nuScenes benchmarks show that SeerDrive significantly\noutperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SeerDrive\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u672a\u6765\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5f53\u524d\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "SeerDrive\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\uff08BEV\uff09\u8868\u793a\u6765\u9884\u5224\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6b64\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u672a\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u672a\u6765\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728NAVSIM\u548cnuScenes\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSeerDrive\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SeerDrive\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u5efa\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

This reveals that these traditional quantities are not\nisolated heuristics but projections of a shared redundancy geometry. The theory\nfurther predicts that redundancy is bounded both above and below, giving rise\nto an optimal equilibrium that balances over-compression (loss of structure)\nand over-coupling (collapse). While classical communication theory favors\nminimal redundancy for transmission efficiency, finite and structured systems,\nsuch as those underlying real-world learning, achieve maximal stability and\ngeneralization near this equilibrium. Experiments with masked autoencoders are\nused to illustrate and verify this principle: the model exhibits a stable\nredundancy level where generalization peaks.

This approach leverages latent feature correlations to recover\nmissing values while balancing reliability and scalability. After evaluating\nmultiple methods, XGBoost was chosen for its superior predictive performance.\n  Results and Discussion: The framework outperformed existing methods and the\ndata challenge leaderboard, demonstrating high accuracy, robustness, and\ninterpretability. SHAP-based post hoc analysis identified top contributing SDOH\nfactors and age-specific feature patterns. Notably, flooring material emerged\nas a strong predictor, reflecting socioeconomic and environmental disparities.\nOther influential factors, age, SES, lifestyle, social interaction, sleep,\nstress, and BMI, underscore the multifactorial nature of cognitive aging and\nthe value of interpretable, data-driven SDOH modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u793e\u4f1a\u5065\u5eb7\u51b3\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff08SDOH\uff09\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u53d1\u73b0AD\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u5176\u795e\u7ecf\u9000\u884c\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u4e0d\u53ef\u9006\uff0c\u4e14\u98ce\u9669\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u8bca\u65ad\u524d\u591a\u5e74\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SVD\u63d2\u8865\u5904\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\uff0cXGBoost\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5173\u952eSDOH\u56e0\u7d20\u5982\u5730\u677f\u6750\u6599\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "SDOH\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u8ba4\u77e5\u8001\u5316\u7684\u591a\u56e0\u7d20\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e9\u671f\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002"}}

However, existing methods lack the flexibility to\nmodulate this reasoning strength, limiting MLLMs' adaptability across factual\nand creative scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose equipping MLLMs with\nmechanisms that enable flexible control over associative reasoning. We begin by\ninvestigating the internal mechanisms underlying associative behavior in MLLMs\nand find that: (1) middle layers play a pivotal role in shaping model's\nassociative tendencies, (2) modifying representations in these layers\neffectively regulates associative reasoning strength, and (3) hallucinations\ncan be exploited to derive steering vectors that guide this modulation.\nBuilding on these findings, we introduce Flexible Association Control (FlexAC),\na lightweight and training-free framework for modulating associative behavior\nin MLLMs. FlexAC first induces hallucination-guided intermediate\nrepresentations to encode associative directions. Then, it selects\nhigh-association instances to construct effective associative steering vectors,\nwhose strengths are adaptively calibrated to balance creative guidance with\noutput stability. Finally, recognizing the multi-dimensional nature of\nassociative reasoning, FlexAC incorporates task-specific associative vectors\nderived from a forward pass on a few target-domain samples, enabling models to\nfollow diverse associative directions and better adapt to creative tasks.\nNotably, our method achieves up to a 5.8x improvement in creativity on\nCreation-MMBench and a 29% reduction in hallucination rate on CHAIR, surpassing\nexisting baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling flexible\ncontrol over associative reasoning in MLLMs. Our code is available at\nhttps://github.com/ylhz/FlexAC.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlexAC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8054\u60f3\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u4e0e\u521b\u9020\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8054\u60f3\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u521b\u9020\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFlexAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u4fee\u6539\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8054\u60f3\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u8054\u60f3\u63a8\u7406\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Creation-MMBench\u4e0a\u521b\u9020\u529b\u63d0\u53475.8\u500d\uff0cCHAIR\u4e0a\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u964d\u4f4e29%\u3002", "conclusion": "FlexAC\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9MLLMs\u8054\u60f3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u521b\u9020\u6027\u4e0e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

This paper presents an\napproach for detecting educational content in online videos. We focus on two\nwidely used educational content classes: literacy and math. For each class, we\nchoose prominent codes (sub-classes) based on the Common Core Standards. For\nexample, literacy codes include `letter names', `letter sounds', and math codes\ninclude `counting', `sorting'. We pose this as a fine-grained multilabel\nclassification problem as videos can contain multiple types of educational\ncontent and the content classes can get visually similar (e.g., `letter names'\nvs `letter sounds'). We propose a novel class prototypes based supervised\ncontrastive learning approach that can handle fine-grained samples associated\nwith multiple labels. We learn a class prototype for each class and a loss\nfunction is employed to minimize the distances between a class prototype and\nthe samples from the class. Similarly, distances between a class prototype and\nthe samples from other classes are maximized. As the alignment between visual\nand audio cues are crucial for effective comprehension, we consider a\nmultimodal transformer network to capture the interaction between visual and\naudio cues in videos while learning the embedding for videos.

When applied to real-world\ndownstream tasks, VLMs inevitably encounter both the in-distribution (ID) data\nand out-of-distribution (OOD) data. The OOD datasets often include both\ncovariate shifts (e.g., known classes with changes in image styles) and\nsemantic shifts (e.g., test-time unseen classes). This highlights the\nimportance of improving VLMs' generalization ability to covariate-shifted OOD\ndata, while effectively detecting open-set semantic-shifted OOD classes. In\nthis paper, inspired by the substantial energy change observed in closed-set\ndata when re-aligning vision-language modalities (specifically by directly\nreducing the maximum cosine similarity to a low value), we introduce a novel\nOOD score, named {\\Delta}Energy. {\\Delta}Energy significantly outperforms the\nvanilla energy-based OOD score and provides a more reliable approach for OOD\ndetection. Furthermore, {\\Delta}Energy can simultaneously improve OOD\ngeneralization under covariate shifts, which is achieved by lower-bound\nmaximization for {\\Delta}Energy (termed EBM). EBM is theoretically proven to\nnot only enhance OOD detection but also yields a domain-consistent Hessian,\nwhich serves as a strong indicator for OOD generalization. Based on this\nfinding, we developed a unified fine-tuning framework that allows for improving\nVLMs' robustness in both OOD generalization and OOD detection.

While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role\nof the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains\nlargely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and\nsupervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward\nfundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical\ndecision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal\nthat RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining\nstable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic\nattractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL,\nwhich converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We\nfurther show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a\npowerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that\nenhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous\nsolutions found by SL-trained networks.

In our scenario, we consider retinal OCTs, where typically\nhigh-quality Spectralis images are available with given ground truth\nsegmentations, enabling the training of segmentation networks. The recent\ndevelopment in Home-OCT devices, however, yields retinal OCTs with lower\nquality and a large domain shift, such that out-of-the-pocket segmentation\nnetworks cannot be applied for this type of data. Synthesizing annotated images\nfrom the Home-OCT domain using the proposed approach closes this gap and leads\nto significantly improved segmentation results without adding any further\nsupervision. The advantage of uncertainty-guidance becomes obvious when\ncompared to style transfer: it enables arbitrary domain shifts without any\nstrict learning of an image style.

To address this, we propose\nDocReward, a document reward model that evaluates documents based on their\nstructure and style. We construct a multi-domain dataset DocPair of 117K paired\ndocuments, covering 32 domains and 267 document types, each including a high-\nand low-professionalism document with identical content but different structure\nand style. This enables the model to evaluate professionalism comprehensively,\nand in a textual-quality-agnostic way. DocReward is trained using the\nBradley-Terry loss to score documents, penalizing predictions that contradict\nthe annotated ranking. To assess the performance of reward models, we create a\ntest dataset containing document bundles ranked by well-educated human\nevaluators.

To address this issue, recent\nwork made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus\nnarrowing down the vulnerability detection \"window\" and providing more\nfine-grained predictions.

However, its capability for\naccurate surface reconstruction remains underexplored. Due to the discrete and\nunstructured nature of Gaussians, supervision based solely on image rendering\nloss often leads to inaccurate geometry and inconsistent multi-view alignment.\nIn this work, we propose a novel method that enhances the geometric\nrepresentation of 3D Gaussians through view alignment (VA). Specifically, we\nincorporate edge-aware image cues into the rendering loss to improve surface\nboundary delineation. To enforce geometric consistency across views, we\nintroduce a visibility-aware photometric alignment loss that models occlusions\nand encourages accurate spatial relationships among Gaussians. To further\nmitigate ambiguities caused by lighting variations, we incorporate normal-based\nconstraints to refine the spatial orientation of Gaussians and improve local\nsurface estimation.

To construct this large-scale dataset, Situat3DChange leverages\n11K human observations of environmental changes to establish shared mental\nmodels and shared situational awareness for human-AI collaboration. These\nobservations, enriched with egocentric and allocentric perspectives as well as\ncategorical and coordinate spatial relations, are integrated using an LLM to\nsupport understanding of situated changes. To address the challenge of\ncomparing pairs of point clouds from the same scene with minor changes, we\npropose SCReasoner, an efficient 3D MLLM approach that enables effective point\ncloud comparison with minimal parameter overhead and no additional tokens\nrequired for the language decoder.

The Low-Rank\nAdaptation (LoRA) enables efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained\nmodels by introducing trainable low-rank matrices into weight updates.However,\nin heterogeneous data scenarios, client drift weakens the generalization of the\nglobal model, and local models often fail to meet the personalized needs of\nindividual clients.Moreover, existing federated LoRA efficient fine-tuning\ntechniques overlook fine-grained analysis of the tuning matrices. To address\nthis, we conducted preliminary experiments and found that different LoRA\nmatrices exhibit different sensitivity to changes in the direction and\nmagnitude of their vectors.We thus propose a fine-grained federated LoRA tuning\nmethod. By fine-tuning the more sensitive directional vectors in the A matrix,\nwhich encode shared knowledge, our method learns shared features more\neffectively across clients and enhances global generalization. Simultaneously,\nby fine-tuning the more sensitive magnitude vectors in the B matrix, which\nencode personalized knowledge, our method better captures personalized\nknowledge, enabling detailed adaptation to local data. The method uses a\npipeline combining global and local optimizers. Global optimization further\nimproves local models, achieving collaborative optimization between global and\nlocal levels. This improves both the generalization ability of the global model\nand the personalized adaptation of local models under heterogeneous data\nscenarios.

While Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they\ninherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based\ntraffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as\nrepresenting the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can\nbe inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,\nwe propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal\nforecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a\nVision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as\nimage sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform\ncell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling\nnumerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents\nfloating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled\nwith a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first\ntrained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for\npredictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a\nmemory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world\nmobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing\nmethods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best\nbaseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios.

For dynamic graph\nlearning, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as popular\nsolutions. Recently, prompt learning methods have been explored on dynamic\ngraphs. However, existing methods generally focus on capturing the relationship\nbetween nodes and time, while overlooking the impact of historical events.

While deep learning models have advanced in network\narchitecture design, they remain heavily limited by scarce multimodal annotated\ndata. Although Mixup-based augmentation improves generalization in unimodal\ntasks, its direct application to MSA introduces critical challenges: random\nmixing often amplifies label ambiguity and semantic inconsistency due to the\nlack of emotion-aware mixing mechanisms. To overcome these issues, we propose\nMS-Mix, an adaptive, emotion-sensitive augmentation framework that\nautomatically optimizes sample mixing in multimodal settings. The key\ncomponents of MS-Mix include: (1) a Sentiment-Aware Sample Selection (SASS)\nstrategy that effectively prevents semantic confusion caused by mixing samples\nwith contradictory emotions. (2) a Sentiment Intensity Guided (SIG) module\nusing multi-head self-attention to compute modality-specific mixing ratios\ndynamically based on their respective emotional intensities.

In recent years, photo enhancement methods have either focused on\nenhancement performance, producing powerful models that cannot be deployed on\nedge devices, or prioritized computational efficiency, resulting in inadequate\nperformance for real-world applications. To this end, this paper introduces a\npyramid network called LLF-LUT++, which integrates global and local operators\nthrough closed-form Laplacian pyramid decomposition and reconstruction. This\napproach enables fast processing of high-resolution images while also achieving\nexcellent performance. Specifically, we utilize an image-adaptive 3D LUT that\ncapitalizes on the global tonal characteristics of downsampled images, while\nincorporating two distinct weight fusion strategies to achieve coarse global\nimage enhancement. To implement this strategy, we designed a spatial-frequency\ntransformer weight predictor that effectively extracts the desired distinct\nweights by leveraging frequency features. Additionally, we apply local\nLaplacian filters to adaptively refine edge details in high-frequency\ncomponents. After meticulously redesigning the network structure and\ntransformer model, LLF-LUT++ not only achieves a 2.64 dB improvement in PSNR on\nthe HDR+ dataset, but also further reduces runtime, with 4K resolution images\nprocessed in just 13 ms on a single GPU.

While motivated by similar goals, these approaches differ in how they\nencode and leverage task-specific information, often provided as in-context\nexamples. In this work, we propose a unified framework which describes how such\nmethods differ primarily in the aspects of learning they amortize - such as\ninitializations, learned updates, or predictive mappings - and how they\nincorporate task data at inference. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes\namortized models into parametric, implicit, and explicit regimes, based on\nwhether task adaptation is externalized, internalized, or jointly modeled.\nBuilding on this view, we identify a key limitation in current approaches: most\nmethods struggle to scale to large datasets because their capacity to process\ntask data at inference (e.g., context length) is often limited. To address\nthis, we propose iterative amortized inference, a class of models that refine\nsolutions step-by-step over mini-batches, drawing inspiration from stochastic\noptimization.

However, the Top-K operator is\nnon-differentiable, hindering end-to-end training. Existing methods include\nLearning-to-Rank approaches (e.g., LambdaLoss), which optimize ranking metrics\nlike NDCG and suffer from objective misalignment, and differentiable\nsorting-based methods (e.g., ARF, LCRON), which relax permutation matrices for\ndirect Top-K optimization but introduce gradient conflicts through matrix\naggregation.

Project website:\n  https://yuxuan-xue.com/physic", "summary": "Reconstructing metrically accurate humans and their surrounding scenes from a\nsingle image is crucial for virtual reality, robotics, and comprehensive 3D\nscene understanding. However, existing methods struggle with depth ambiguity,\nocclusions, and physically inconsistent contacts. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce PhySIC, a framework for physically plausible Human-Scene\nInteraction and Contact reconstruction. PhySIC recovers metrically consistent\nSMPL-X human meshes, dense scene surfaces, and vertex-level contact maps within\na shared coordinate frame from a single RGB image. Starting from coarse\nmonocular depth and body estimates, PhySIC performs occlusion-aware inpainting,\nfuses visible depth with unscaled geometry for a robust metric scaffold, and\nsynthesizes missing support surfaces like floors. A confidence-weighted\noptimization refines body pose, camera parameters, and global scale by jointly\nenforcing depth alignment, contact priors, interpenetration avoidance, and 2D\nreprojection consistency. Explicit occlusion masking safeguards invisible\nregions against implausible configurations. PhySIC is efficient, requiring only\n9 seconds for joint human-scene optimization and under 27 seconds end-to-end.\nIt naturally handles multiple humans, enabling reconstruction of diverse\ninteractions. Empirically, PhySIC outperforms single-image baselines, reducing\nmean per-vertex scene error from 641 mm to 227 mm, halving PA-MPJPE to 42 mm,\nand improving contact F1 from 0.09 to 0.51. Qualitative results show realistic\nfoot-floor interactions, natural seating, and plausible reconstructions of\nheavily occluded furniture.

At inference,\nwe decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle,\nkeeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains.\nAcross three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong\nbaselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the\nbenefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference\ndecoupling.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLook\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\uff08MLLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u524d\u7aef\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "LLMs\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u524d\u7aef\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u56e0\u9700\u8bc4\u4f30\u6e32\u67d3\u50cf\u7d20\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u800c\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MLLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u6279\u8bc4\u8005\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u6e90\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u786e\u4fdd\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cReLook\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLook\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u4ee3\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u8026\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational\ntasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect\nstudent answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance\ninferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher\nalignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect\nanswers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aMISTAKE\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u6216\u8f85\u52a9\u6559\u5e08\u57f9\u8bad\u3002", "method": "MISTAKE\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u8bef\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u8bef\u89e3\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6559\u80b2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cMISTAKE\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5b66\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u6f5c\u5728\u8bef\u89e3\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u7b54\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "MISTAKE\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Under the multi-hop settings, existing methods often struggle to fully\nunderstand the questions with complex semantic structures and are susceptible\nto irrelevant noise during the retrieval of multiple information targets. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a novel graph representation learning\nframework for multi-hop question retrieval. We first introduce a\nMulti-information Level Knowledge Graph (Multi-L KG) to model various\ninformation levels for a more comprehensive understanding of multi-hop\nquestions. Based on this, we design a Query-Specific Graph Neural Network\n(QSGNN) for representation learning on the Multi-L KG. QSGNN employs\nintra/inter-level message passing mechanisms, and in each message passing the\ninformation aggregation is guided by the query, which not only facilitates\nmulti-granular information aggregation but also significantly reduces the\nimpact of noise.

To address\nthis challenge, we propose the first diffusion-based DFL approach, which trains\na diffusion model to represent the distribution of uncertain parameters and\noptimizes the decision by solving a stochastic optimization with samples drawn\nfrom the diffusion model.

In\nthis paper, we investigate the value of deliberate exploration -- explicitly\nincentivizing the model to discover novel and diverse behaviors -- and aim to\nunderstand how the knowledge in pre-trained models can guide this search. Our\nmain finding is that exploration with a simple, principled,\nrepresentation-based bonus derived from the pre-trained language model's hidden\nstates significantly improves diversity and pass@k rates -- both for\npost-training, and in a novel inference-time scaling setting we introduce. For\ninference-time, exploration with representation-based diversity improves\nefficiency, consistently improving pass@k rates across a variety of models and\nreasoning tasks. For example, for Qwen-2.5-14b-Instruct we obtain over 50%\nimprovement in verifier efficiency on almost all tasks.
