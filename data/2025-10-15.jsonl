In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor.

IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated\nmodules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a\ndeeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical\nanalysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and\narchitectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack\neffectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By\nexposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers\na previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,\noffering valuable insights for improving their resilience.

In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,\nnot all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be\nintegrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a\nnondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation\ninto deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the\nGumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall\nshort in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.\nOnce the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust\nto different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this\nend, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even\nduring inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and\nreduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as\nwell as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them\nbeing a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical\nconditions."}

Most existing multi-modal\nalignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or\nadding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main\nlimitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular\ninputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural\nfeatures; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to\ncatastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In\nthis paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an\ninstance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule\non-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)\nthat produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input\nmolecular graph.

Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to\nmitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor\nand all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global\nsynchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution\nof trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.\nOur key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep\nthrough trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each\ntrajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL\npost-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace\nglobal updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter\nservice. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,\nallowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the\nactor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates\nlong-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation\nthroughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring\nrobustness for long-running jobs.

With the advent of capable image and video generation\nmodels, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars\nfrom a single casually captured reference image of a target subject.

For\na single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to\nminimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that\nindividual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a\nvariant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor\nthat simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for\nachieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods\nthat optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain\nomniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based\napproaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case\" loss in an online\nfashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly\nmore difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must\nincur suboptimal sample complexity.

However, existing Visual\nQuestion Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic\nunderstanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.\nConfined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these\nquestions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This\nlimitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than\nengage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a\nnew, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark\nis constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents\ncollaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse\nquestions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual\nunderstanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic\nmeaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14\nstate-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in\ncurrent models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a\nclear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models."}

In this work, we propose an inference-time\nfeature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and\nimprove upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the\nart for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and\npreserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide\nrange of downstream tasks."}

Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use\nthe last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train\nlarge unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands\nsubstantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its\naccessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model\nconditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a\nunified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the\nalignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning\ncapabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In\naddition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for\ngeneration, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits\ntremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image\nediting, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating\nthe unified encoder design of UniFusion."}

While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work\nwith images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration\nstructures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we\nintroduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.\nOur CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable\nsingle-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly\nlearned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature\nvectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as\nSwin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our\nvectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on\nbenchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit\nCuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in\nlimited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for\nintegrating global structural information into deep networks for structured\nimage analysis."}
