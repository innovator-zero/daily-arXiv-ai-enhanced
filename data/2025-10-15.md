### [1] [Enhancing the Quality of 3D Lunar Maps Using JAXA's Kaguya Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11817)
*Yumi Iwashita,Haakon Moe,Yang Cheng,Adnan Ansar,Georgios Georgakis,Adrian Stoica,Kazuto Nakashima,Ryo Kurazume,Jim Torresen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种方法，通过减少压缩图像中的噪声，提高Kaguya TC图像生成的3D月球地图质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球月球探索需求增加，但现有Kaguya TC图像因压缩和立体匹配误差导致高度不准确，影响任务安全。

Method: 分析Kaguya TC图像的压缩行为，识别噪声模式，提出减少视差图中残余噪声的方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法有效降低高程噪声，提升地形数据的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: 该方法为未来月球任务提供了更高质量的3D地图，支持长距离任务如NASA的Endurance任务。

Abstract: As global efforts to explore the Moon intensify, the need for high-quality 3D
lunar maps becomes increasingly critical-particularly for long-distance
missions such as NASA's Endurance mission concept, in which a rover aims to
traverse 2,000 km across the South Pole-Aitken basin. Kaguya TC (Terrain
Camera) images, though globally available at 10 m/pixel, suffer from altitude
inaccuracies caused by stereo matching errors and JPEG-based compression
artifacts. This paper presents a method to improve the quality of 3D maps
generated from Kaguya TC images, focusing on mitigating the effects of
compression-induced noise in disparity maps. We analyze the compression
behavior of Kaguya TC imagery, and identify systematic disparity noise
patterns, especially in darker regions. In this paper, we propose an approach
to enhance 3D map quality by reducing residual noise in disparity images
derived from compressed images. Our experimental results show that the proposed
approach effectively reduces elevation noise, enhancing the safety and
reliability of terrain data for future lunar missions.

### [2] [Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835)
*Yiming Liu,Yuhui Zhang,Dhruba Ghosh,Ludwig Schmidt,Serena Yeung-Levy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLIP和DINO在相同条件下预训练后，CLIP在文本密集型任务中表现更好，而DINO在视觉中心任务中略优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究CLIP的优势是否源于语言监督或更大的训练数据。

Method: 在相同架构、数据集和训练配置下预训练CLIP和DINO，分析嵌入特征并评估在VQA任务中的表现。

Result: CLIP擅长高层次语义（如对象类别、文本），DINO对低层次特征（如颜色、样式）更敏感。

Conclusion: 语言监督对CLIP的优势贡献有限，视觉编码器设计对VLM性能有重要影响。

Abstract: CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for
vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage
stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To
disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings
-- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration --
achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP
captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is
more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated
into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive
tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of
language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield
limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder
design and its impact on VLM performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoDINO是一种新型自监督学习框架，专为乳腺X光检查设计，通过创新的数据增强和对比学习目标，在多个乳腺癌筛查任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自监督学习在医学影像中应用有限，主要因数据不足和领域特定偏差。MammoDINO旨在解决这一问题，提供无标注的计算机辅助诊断基础。

Method: 引入乳腺组织感知的数据增强采样器和跨切片对比学习目标，利用3D结构进行2D预训练。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上实现最先进性能，并展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MammoDINO为乳腺X光检查提供了一种可扩展、无标注的多用途CAD工具基础，有助于减轻放射科医生负担并提高诊断效率。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has transformed vision encoder training in
general domains but remains underutilized in medical imaging due to limited
data and domain specific biases. We present MammoDINO, a novel SSL framework
for mammography, pretrained on 1.4 million mammographic images. To capture
clinically meaningful features, we introduce a breast tissue aware data
augmentation sampler for both image-level and patch-level supervision and a
cross-slice contrastive learning objective that leverages 3D digital breast
tomosynthesis (DBT) structure into 2D pretraining. MammoDINO achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple breast cancer screening tasks and
generalizes well across five benchmark datasets. It offers a scalable,
annotation-free foundation for multipurpose computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
tools for mammogram, helping reduce radiologists' workload and improve
diagnostic efficiency in breast cancer screening.

TL;DR: 提出了一种双模型框架，结合VideoLLaMA和Qwen2.5-VL的优势，通过任务特定优化提升交通视频分析性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通视频分析需要细粒度行为理解和全面描述生成，现有方法存在任务干扰问题。

Method: 采用双模型框架，分别训练VideoLLaMA（擅长时序推理）和Qwen2.5-VL（擅长视觉理解），减少任务干扰。

Result: 在WTS数据集上，VQA准确率提升8.6%，S2得分45.7572，AI City Challenge排名第10。

Conclusion: 分离训练策略优于联合训练，验证了双模型框架在交通视频分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Traffic safety analysis requires complex video understanding to capture
fine-grained behavioral patterns and generate comprehensive descriptions for
accident prevention. In this work, we present a unique dual-model framework
that strategically utilizes the complementary strengths of VideoLLaMA and
Qwen2.5-VL through task-specific optimization to address this issue. The core
insight behind our approach is that separating training for captioning and
visual question answering (VQA) tasks minimizes task interference and allows
each model to specialize more effectively. Experimental results demonstrate
that VideoLLaMA is particularly effective in temporal reasoning, achieving a
CIDEr score of 1.1001, while Qwen2.5-VL excels in visual understanding with a
VQA accuracy of 60.80\%. Through extensive experiments on the WTS dataset, our
method achieves an S2 score of 45.7572 in the 2025 AI City Challenge Track 2,
placing 10th on the challenge leaderboard. Ablation studies validate that our
separate training strategy outperforms joint training by 8.6\% in VQA accuracy
while maintaining captioning quality.

### [5] [PanoTPS-Net: Panoramic Room Layout Estimation via Thin Plate Spline Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11992)
*Hatem Ibrahem,Ahmed Salem,Qinmin Vivian Hu,Guanghui Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PanoTPS-Net利用CNN和TPS空间变换从单张全景图像估计房间3D布局，适用于立方体和非立方体布局。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计房间3D布局在计算机视觉中至关重要，应用于机器人、增强现实和室内设计。

Method: 两阶段模型：CNN提取特征并预测TPS参数，TPS层根据参数变形参考布局。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，3DIoU值达85.49-91.98。

Conclusion: PanoTPS-Net在房间布局估计中高效且兼容全景图像，适用于多种布局类型。

Abstract: Accurately estimating the 3D layout of rooms is a crucial task in computer
vision, with potential applications in robotics, augmented reality, and
interior design. This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate
room layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial
transformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:
First, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the
input images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS
transformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to
warp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted
parameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room
layouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid
layouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation
and emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama
images. The robustness of the model in handling both cuboid and non-cuboid room
layout estimation is evident with a 3DIoU value of 85.49, 86.16, 81.76, and
91.98 on PanoContext, Stanford-2D3D, Matterport3DLayout, and ZInD datasets,
respectively. The source code is available at:

### [6] [Prompt-Guided Spatial Understanding with RGB-D Transformers for Fine-Grained Object Relation Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11996)
*Tanner Muturi,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Neema Jakisa Owor,Richard Dyzinela,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对大规模3D环境（如仓库）的空间推理框架，通过嵌入边界框坐标增强模型的空间理解能力，并在AI City Challenge中取得第四名的成绩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言系统在复杂3D环境中因场景杂乱、遮挡和缺乏显式空间基础而表现不佳，需改进空间推理能力。

Method: 通过将边界框坐标嵌入输入提示中，结合任务特定监督微调模型，覆盖距离估计、物体计数等四类问题。

Result: 最终得分为73.0606，在公开排行榜上排名第四。

Conclusion: 结构化提示增强和目标优化能有效提升工业环境中的空间推理能力。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large-scale 3D environments such as warehouses remains a
significant challenge for vision-language systems due to scene clutter,
occlusions, and the need for precise spatial understanding. Existing models
often struggle with generalization in such settings, as they rely heavily on
local appearance and lack explicit spatial grounding. In this work, we
introduce a dedicated spatial reasoning framework for the Physical AI Spatial
Intelligence Warehouse dataset introduced in the Track 3 2025 AI City
Challenge. Our approach enhances spatial comprehension by embedding mask
dimensions in the form of bounding box coordinates directly into the input
prompts, enabling the model to reason over object geometry and layout. We
fine-tune the framework across four question categories namely: Distance
Estimation, Object Counting, Multi-choice Grounding, and Spatial Relation
Inference using task-specific supervision. To further improve consistency with
the evaluation system, normalized answers are appended to the GPT response
within the training set. Our comprehensive pipeline achieves a final score of
73.0606, placing 4th overall on the public leaderboard. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of structured prompt enrichment and targeted
optimization in advancing spatial reasoning for real-world industrial
environments.

### [7] [Evaluating the Explainability of Vision Transformers in Medical Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12021)
*Leili Barekatain,Ben Glocker*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究评估了不同Vision Transformer架构和预训练策略在医学影像中的可解释性，发现DINO结合Grad-CAM提供最忠实和局部化的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中模型决策的可解释性直接影响临床信任和采用，但Vision Transformers的复杂注意力机制对可解释性提出了挑战。

Method: 使用Gradient Attention Rollout和Grad-CAM对ViT、DeiT、DINO和Swin Transformer进行定量和定性分析，应用于血细胞分类和乳腺超声分类任务。

Result: DINO与Grad-CAM结合在数据集中提供最忠实和局部化的解释，Grad-CAM生成类判别和空间精确的热图，而Gradient Attention Rollout产生更分散的激活。

Conclusion: 通过提高模型透明度，研究支持将ViTs可靠且可解释地集成到关键医学诊断工作流程中。

Abstract: Understanding model decisions is crucial in medical imaging, where
interpretability directly impacts clinical trust and adoption. Vision
Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in
diagnostic imaging; however, their complex attention mechanisms pose challenges
to explainability. This study evaluates the explainability of different Vision
Transformer architectures and pre-training strategies - ViT, DeiT, DINO, and
Swin Transformer - using Gradient Attention Rollout and Grad-CAM. We conduct
both quantitative and qualitative analyses on two medical imaging tasks:
peripheral blood cell classification and breast ultrasound image
classification. Our findings indicate that DINO combined with Grad-CAM offers
the most faithful and localized explanations across datasets. Grad-CAM
consistently produces class-discriminative and spatially precise heatmaps,
while Gradient Attention Rollout yields more scattered activations. Even in
misclassification cases, DINO with Grad-CAM highlights clinically relevant
morphological features that appear to have misled the model. By improving model
transparency, this research supports the reliable and explainable integration
of ViTs into critical medical diagnostic workflows.

### [8] [APGNet: Adaptive Prior-Guided for Underwater Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12056)
*Xinxin Huang,Han Sun,Junmin Cai,Ningzhong Liu,Huiyu Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: APGNet是一种自适应先验引导网络，用于水下环境中伪装物体的检测，通过结合Siamese架构和先验引导机制，提高了检测的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像退化（如低对比度和颜色失真）以及海洋生物的自然伪装是现有方法的两大挑战，传统方法难以应对。

Method: APGNet采用MSRCR算法进行数据增强，设计了ERF模块和MPD解码器，并提出了自适应先验引导机制，融合位置和边界先验。

Result: 在两个公开的MAS数据集上，APGNet在多项评估指标上优于15种现有方法。

Conclusion: APGNet通过创新的先验引导机制和多尺度特征处理，显著提升了水下伪装物体检测的性能。

Abstract: Detecting camouflaged objects in underwater environments is crucial for
marine ecological research and resource exploration. However, existing methods
face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast
and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms.
Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features
in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed
for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to
the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics.
  To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network,
which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to
enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale
Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation,
generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects.
Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a
Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual
information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an
adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary
priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse
localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level
features.
  Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that
our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely
used evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: VidMP3是一种基于扩散的视频编辑方法，通过利用姿势和位置先验学习运动表示，实现结构灵活且语义一致的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在结构可变编辑中存在时间不一致、主体身份漂移等问题，需要更灵活且一致的解决方案。

Method: 利用姿势和位置先验学习源视频的广义运动表示，生成保持原始运动的新视频。

Result: 定性和定量评估表明，VidMP3优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VidMP3为结构灵活的视频编辑提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Motion-preserved video editing is crucial for creators, particularly in
scenarios that demand flexibility in both the structure and semantics of
swapped objects. Despite its potential, this area remains underexplored.
Existing diffusion-based editing methods excel in structure-preserving tasks,
using dense guidance signals to ensure content integrity. While some recent
methods attempt to address structure-variable editing, they often suffer from
issues such as temporal inconsistency, subject identity drift, and the need for
human intervention. To address these challenges, we introduce VidMP3, a novel
approach that leverages pose and position priors to learn a generalized motion
representation from source videos. Our method enables the generation of new
videos that maintain the original motion while allowing for structural and
semantic flexibility. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate
the superiority of our approach over existing methods. The code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/sandeep-sm/VidMP3.

Abstract: The major challenge in today's computer vision scenario is the availability
of good quality labeled data. In a field of study like image classification,
where data is of utmost importance, we need to find more reliable methods which
can overcome the scarcity of data to produce results comparable to previous
benchmark results. In most cases, obtaining labeled data is very difficult
because of the high cost of human labor and in some cases impossible. The
purpose of this paper is to discuss Domain Adaptation and various methods to
implement it. The main idea is to use a model trained on a particular dataset
to predict on data from a different domain of the same kind, for example - a
model trained on paintings of airplanes predicting on real images of airplanes

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved audio-driven
human video generation, surpassing traditional methods in both quality and
controllability. However, existing approaches still face challenges in lip-sync
accuracy, temporal coherence for long video generation, and multi-character
animation. In this work, we propose a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based
framework for generating lifelike talking videos of arbitrary length, and
introduce a training-free method for multi-character audio-driven animation.
First, we employ a LoRA-based training strategy combined with a position shift
inference approach, which enables efficient long video generation while
preserving the capabilities of the foundation model. Moreover, we combine
partial parameter updates with reward feedback to enhance both lip
synchronization and natural body motion. Finally, we propose a training-free
approach, Mask Classifier-Free Guidance (Mask-CFG), for multi-character
animation, which requires no specialized datasets or model modifications and
supports audio-driven animation for three or more characters. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving high-quality, temporally coherent, and multi-character
audio-driven video generation in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective
manner.

### [13] [An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098)
*Jianping Li,Dongyang Guo,Wenjie Li,Wei Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对QR码去模糊的新方法，结合边缘先验和自适应双网络，显著提升解码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法未充分利用QR码的结构化边缘先验，导致解码效果不佳。

Method: 设计了EGAB模块嵌入边缘先验，并基于此构建EG-Restormer和LENet，最终整合为自适应双网络ADNet。

Result: EG-Restormer和ADNet在严重和轻度模糊QR码上均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式利用边缘先验和自适应网络选择，显著提升了QR码去模糊的解码效果。

Abstract: Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code
deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized
by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration.
Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To
address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which
embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we
develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that
significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly
blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for
fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive
Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on
input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices.
Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve
state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page:

Conclusion: 几何准确性是提升3D场景重建的关键，该方法在室内外场景中具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in leveraging generative prior from pre-trained
diffusion models for 3D scene reconstruction, existing methods still face two
critical limitations. First, due to the lack of reliable geometric supervision,
they struggle to produce high-quality reconstructions even in observed regions,
let alone in unobserved areas. Second, they lack effective mechanisms to
mitigate multi-view inconsistencies in the generated images, leading to severe
shape-appearance ambiguities and degraded scene geometry. In this paper, we
identify accurate geometry as the fundamental prerequisite for effectively
exploiting generative models to enhance 3D scene reconstruction. We first
propose to leverage the prevalence of planar structures to derive accurate
metric-scale depth maps, providing reliable supervision in both observed and
unobserved regions. Furthermore, we incorporate this geometry guidance
throughout the generative pipeline to improve visibility mask estimation, guide
novel view selection, and enhance multi-view consistency when inpainting with
video diffusion models, resulting in accurate and consistent scene completion.
Extensive experiments on Replica, ScanNet++, and DeepBlending show that our
method consistently outperforms existing baselines in both geometry and
appearance reconstruction, particularly for unobserved regions. Moreover, our
method naturally supports single-view inputs and unposed videos, with strong
generalizability in both indoor and outdoor scenarios with practical real-world
applicability. The project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DRL的框架，通过轻量级适配器和解耦锚监督解决非排练类增量学习中的三大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非排练类增量学习中模型复杂度增加、表示偏移不平滑以及局部优化与全局推理不一致的问题。

Method: 使用增量并行适配器（IPA）网络和解耦锚监督（DAS）方法，通过轻量级适配器和平行连接实现平滑表示迁移。

Result: 在六个基准测试中，DRL始终优于其他最先进方法，同时保持训练和推理的高效性。

Conclusion: DRL框架有效解决了类增量学习中的关键挑战，显著提升了性能与效率。

Abstract: With the excellent representation capabilities of Pre-Trained Models (PTMs),
remarkable progress has been made in non-rehearsal Class-Incremental Learning
(CIL) research. However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three
conundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation
shift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise
sub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the
Discriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address
these challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet
efficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)
network, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a
lightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each
incremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new
classes, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the
current model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a
result, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different
incremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable
comparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the
Decoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and
negative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This
decoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the
feature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between
stage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across
all classes. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks reveal that our DRL
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods throughout the entire
CIL period while maintaining high efficiency in both training and inference
phases.

Motivation: 老照片修复面临局部退化和颜色失真的挑战，现有方法依赖显式退化先验或全局统计指导，效果有限。

Method: 利用预训练扩散模型生成伪参考脸，结合人脸解析图和划痕掩码，分阶段监督修复结构和颜色。

Result: 在VintageFace基准测试中，SSDiff在感知质量、保真度和区域可控性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SSDiff通过自监督和选择性引导，有效解决了老照片修复中的局部退化和颜色问题。

Abstract: Old-photo face restoration poses significant challenges due to compounded
degradations such as breakage, fading, and severe blur. Existing pre-trained
diffusion-guided methods either rely on explicit degradation priors or global
statistical guidance, which struggle with localized artifacts or face color. We
propose Self-Supervised Selective-Guided Diffusion (SSDiff), which leverages
pseudo-reference faces generated by a pre-trained diffusion model under weak
guidance. These pseudo-labels exhibit structurally aligned contours and natural
colors, enabling region-specific restoration via staged supervision: structural
guidance applied throughout the denoising process and color refinement in later
steps, aligned with the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion. By incorporating
face parsing maps and scratch masks, our method selectively restores breakage
regions while avoiding identity mismatch. We further construct VintageFace, a
300-image benchmark of real old face photos with varying degradation levels.
SSDiff outperforms existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods in perceptual
quality, fidelity, and regional controllability. Code link:

TL;DR: ImageSentinel是一种保护视觉数据集在检索增强图像生成（RAIG）中免受未经授权使用的框架，通过生成视觉一致的哨兵图像和随机字符序列进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RAIG系统的广泛应用引发了对私有图像数据集未经授权使用的担忧，传统数字水印方法在RAIG中效果有限。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型生成与原始数据集视觉一致的哨兵图像，并通过随机字符序列作为检索键进行保护验证。

Result: 实验表明，ImageSentinel能有效检测未经授权的数据集使用，同时保持授权应用的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageSentinel为解决RAIG系统中的数据集保护问题提供了一种有效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of Retrieval-Augmented Image Generation (RAIG) has
raised significant concerns about the unauthorized use of private image
datasets. While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing
generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from
unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional
digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the
complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve
watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose
ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our
framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the
original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through
randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure
seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the
sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel
effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation
quality for authorized applications. Code is available at

*David Parra,Felipe Gutierrez-Barragan,Trevor Seets,Andreas Velten*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于梯度下降的优化方法，用于设计适用于硬件约束的压缩单光子3D成像编码函数，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单光子相机在飞行时间3D成像中表现优异，但受硬件限制（如带宽、激光功率等）影响性能。压缩直方图虽解决了数据速率问题，但在实际硬件约束下表现不佳。

Method: 采用梯度下降联合优化照明和编码矩阵，确保符合硬件约束。

Result: 仿真显示，该方法在带宽和峰值功率约束下均优于传统编码设计，尤其在峰值功率受限系统中优势显著。

Conclusion: 该方法能适应任意参数化脉冲响应，适用于非理想脉冲响应的实际系统。

Abstract: Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D
imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution.
However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as
system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory
and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a
solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression
of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited
in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected
to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a
constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for
compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly
optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that
adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our
coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both
bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced
in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts
to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world
system with a non-ideal impulse response function.

Motivation: 当前开源模型在通用视觉描述任务中与商业模型存在性能差距，限制了数据合成等应用。

Method: 提出CapFlow工作流，利用开源模型协作生成高质量描述，并通过微调训练MetaCaptioner。

Result: CapFlow成本降低89.5%，MetaCaptioner性能媲美商业模型，并在开源社区达到顶级多模态性能。

Conclusion: CapFlow和MetaCaptioner为多模态研究提供了高效、低成本的视觉描述解决方案。

Abstract: Generalist visual captioning goes beyond a simple appearance description
task, but requires integrating a series of visual cues into a caption and
handling various visual domains. In this task, current open-source models
present a large performance gap with commercial ones, which limits various
applications such as data synthesis. To bridge the gap, this paper proposes
CapFlow, a novel multi-agent collaboration workflow. CapFlow demonstrates for
the first time that, by capitalizing on open-source models, it is possible to
achieve caption quality on par with GPT-4.1 in various domains with an 89.5%
reduction in costs. By leveraging CapFlow as the data synthesizer, we produce
high-quality visual captions from image and video domains at scale, and obtain
a generalist visual captioner via fine-tuning, namely MetaCaptioner. Through
extensive experiments, we show that MetaCaptioner not only achieves comparable
captioning capabilities with commercial models but also reaches top-tier
multimodal performance in the open-source community. We hope CapFlow and
MetaCaptioner can benefit future multimodal research by providing a strong and
cost-effective visual captioning solution.

Motivation: 远程生理测量需要处理用户隐私敏感数据，且现有方法依赖标记数据，难以适应现实世界中大量无标记数据的模型更新需求。

Method: 提出FedHUG框架，包含最小偏差聚合模块和全局分布感知学习控制器，动态调整权重和训练策略。

Result: 在RGB视频和毫米波雷达的估计任务中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: FedHUG为解决无监督领域泛化和异构数据问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Remote physiological measurement gained wide attention, while it requires
collecting users' privacy-sensitive information, and existing contactless
measurements still rely on labeled client data. This presents challenges when
we want to further update real-world deployed models with numerous user data
lacking labels. To resolve these challenges, we instantiate a new protocol
called Federated Unsupervised Domain Generalization (FUDG) in this work.
Subsequently, the \textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{H}eterogeneous
\textbf{U}nsupervised \textbf{G}eneralization (\textbf{FedHUG}) framework is
proposed and consists of: (1) Minimal Bias Aggregation module dynamically
adjusts aggregation weights based on prior-driven bias evaluation to cope with
heterogeneous non-IID features from multiple domains. (2) The Global
Distribution-aware Learning Controller parameterizes the label distribution and
dynamically manipulates client-specific training strategies, thereby mitigating
the server-client label distribution skew and long-tail issue. The proposal
shows superior performance across state-of-the-art techniques in estimation
with either RGB video or mmWave radar. The code will be released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为KFF的方法，通过知识融合与分裂解决持续测试时适应中的知识遗忘和新知识学习不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CTTA方法在适应新域时易受历史知识干扰且学习不足，导致性能下降。

Method: 设计了KFI模块分离新域知识，KFU模块高效融合新旧知识。

Result: 在ImageNet-C数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: KFF方法能动态积累知识，提升模型在持续测试时的适应能力。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) aims to quickly fine-tune the model
during the test phase so that it can adapt to multiple unknown downstream
domain distributions without pre-acquiring downstream domain data. To this end,
existing advanced CTTA methods mainly reduce the catastrophic forgetting of
historical knowledge caused by irregular switching of downstream domain data by
restoring the initial model or reusing historical models. However, these
methods are usually accompanied by serious insufficient learning of new
knowledge and interference from potentially harmful historical knowledge,
resulting in severe performance degradation. To this end, we propose a
class-aware domain Knowledge Fusion and Fission method for continual test-time
adaptation, called KFF, which adaptively expands and merges class-aware domain
knowledge in old and new domains according to the test-time data from different
domains, where discriminative historical knowledge can be dynamically
accumulated. Specifically, considering the huge domain gap within streaming
data, a domain Knowledge FIssion (KFI) module is designed to adaptively
separate new domain knowledge from a paired class-aware domain prompt pool,
alleviating the impact of negative knowledge brought by old domains that are
distinct from the current domain. Besides, to avoid the cumulative computation
and storage overheads from continuously fissioning new knowledge, a domain
Knowledge FUsion (KFU) module is further designed to merge the fissioned new
knowledge into the existing knowledge pool with minimal cost, where a greedy
knowledge dynamic merging strategy is designed to improve the compatibility of
new and old knowledge while keeping the computational efficiency. Extensive
experiments on the ImageNet-C dataset verify the effectiveness of our proposed
method against other methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于平均的原型方法无法捕捉类内多样性，限制了在有限标注数据和患者解剖变异下的泛化能力。

Method: DPL通过扩散过程生成多样化的原型变体，结合空间感知条件和保守融合策略，增强原型表示。

Result: 在腹部MRI和CT数据集上取得显著改进，达到新的最先进性能。

Conclusion: DPL通过概率化原型表示和扩散增强，有效解决了一次性医学分割中的表示瓶颈问题。

Abstract: One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype
representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical
variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on
deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations
that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.
This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that
reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space
exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability
distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically
coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates
through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement
module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via
forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism
that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,
and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while
maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference
consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both
phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final
representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself
acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets
demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new
state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SSP的方法，通过结合帧内和帧间提示来提升视频理解的性能，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视频分类中压缩视觉提示时未能充分捕捉时空上下文信息，限制了性能。

Method: 设计了IFG模块聚合帧内空间信息，IFS模块传播帧间时空信息，通过自适应平衡提升性能。

Result: 在四个视频基准数据集上平均性能提升2.76%，同时减少了微调参数的开销。

Conclusion: SSP方法通过有效传播时空信息，显著提升了视频理解的性能，且效率更高。

Abstract: Recently, pre-trained state space models have shown great potential for video
classification, which sequentially compresses visual tokens in videos with
linear complexity, thereby improving the processing efficiency of video data
while maintaining high performance. To apply powerful pre-trained models to
downstream tasks, prompt learning is proposed to achieve efficient downstream
task adaptation with only a small number of fine-tuned parameters. However, the
sequentially compressed visual prompt tokens fail to capture the spatial and
temporal contextual information in the video, thus limiting the effective
propagation of spatial information within a video frame and temporal
information between frames in the state compression model and the extraction of
discriminative information. To tackle the above issue, we proposed a State
Space Prompting (SSP) method for video understanding, which combines
intra-frame and inter-frame prompts to aggregate and propagate key
spatiotemporal information in the video. Specifically, an Intra-Frame Gathering
(IFG) module is designed to aggregate spatial key information within each
frame. Besides, an Inter-Frame Spreading (IFS) module is designed to spread
discriminative spatio-temporal information across different frames. By
adaptively balancing and compressing key spatio-temporal information within and
between frames, our SSP effectively propagates discriminative information in
videos in a complementary manner. Extensive experiments on four video benchmark
datasets verify that our SSP significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods by
2.76% on average while reducing the overhead of fine-tuning parameters.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose UniGS, a unified map representation and
differentiable framework for high-fidelity multimodal 3D reconstruction based
on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Our framework integrates a CUDA-accelerated
rasterization pipeline capable of rendering photo-realistic RGB images,
geometrically accurate depth maps, consistent surface normals, and semantic
logits simultaneously. We redesign the rasterization to render depth via
differentiable ray-ellipsoid intersection rather than using Gaussian centers,
enabling effective optimization of rotation and scale attribute through
analytic depth gradients. Furthermore, we derive the analytic gradient
formulation for surface normal rendering, ensuring geometric consistency among
reconstructed 3D scenes. To improve computational and storage efficiency, we
introduce a learnable attribute that enables differentiable pruning of
Gaussians with minimal contribution during training. Quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy
across all modalities, validating the efficacy of our geometry-aware paradigm.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，碰撞率降低18%，泛化能力和长尾场景表现提升。

Conclusion: CoIRL-AD有效结合IL和RL，显著提升自动驾驶模型的性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving models trained solely with imitation learning
(IL) often suffer from poor generalization. In contrast, reinforcement learning
(RL) promotes exploration through reward maximization but faces challenges such
as sample inefficiency and unstable convergence. A natural solution is to
combine IL and RL. Moving beyond the conventional two-stage paradigm (IL
pretraining followed by RL fine-tuning), we propose CoIRL-AD, a competitive
dual-policy framework that enables IL and RL agents to interact during
training. CoIRL-AD introduces a competition-based mechanism that facilitates
knowledge exchange while preventing gradient conflicts. Experiments on the
nuScenes dataset show an 18% reduction in collision rate compared to baselines,
along with stronger generalization and improved performance on long-tail
scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/SEU-zxj/CoIRL-AD.

Result: 在ScanNetV2和S3DIS数据集上表现优异，计算效率高。

Conclusion: BEEP3D在弱监督方法中具有竞争力，且简化了训练流程。

Abstract: 3D instance segmentation is crucial for understanding complex 3D
environments, yet fully supervised methods require dense point-level
annotations, resulting in substantial annotation costs and labor overhead. To
mitigate this, box-level annotations have been explored as a weaker but more
scalable form of supervision. However, box annotations inherently introduce
ambiguity in overlapping regions, making accurate point-to-instance assignment
challenging. Recent methods address this ambiguity by generating pseudo-masks
through training a dedicated pseudo-labeler in an additional training stage.
However, such two-stage pipelines often increase overall training time and
complexity, hinder end-to-end optimization. To overcome these challenges, we
propose BEEP3D-Box-supervised End-to-End Pseudo-mask generation for 3D instance
segmentation. BEEP3D adopts a student-teacher framework, where the teacher
model serves as a pseudo-labeler and is updated by the student model via an
Exponential Moving Average. To better guide the teacher model to generate
precise pseudo-masks, we introduce an instance center-based query refinement
that enhances position query localization and leverages features near instance
centers. Additionally, we design two novel losses-query consistency loss and
masked feature consistency loss-to align semantic and geometric signals between
predictions and pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and S3DIS
datasets demonstrate that BEEP3D achieves competitive or superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods while remaining
computationally efficient.

Result: 实验表明EReLiFM在OSDG-NL任务上优于现有方法，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EReLiFM通过可靠性感知和不确定性感知的转移路径，有效解决了标签噪声问题，提升了开放集领域泛化的性能。

Abstract: Open-Set Domain Generalization (OSDG) aims to enable deep learning models to
recognize unseen categories in new domains, which is crucial for real-world
applications. Label noise hinders open-set domain generalization by corrupting
source-domain knowledge, making it harder to recognize known classes and reject
unseen ones. While existing methods address OSDG under Noisy Labels (OSDG-NL)
using hyperbolic prototype-guided meta-learning, they struggle to bridge domain
gaps, especially with limited clean labeled data. In this paper, we propose
Evidential Reliability-Aware Residual Flow Meta-Learning (EReLiFM). We first
introduce an unsupervised two-stage evidential loss clustering method to
promote label reliability awareness. Then, we propose a residual flow matching
mechanism that models structured domain- and category-conditioned residuals,
enabling diverse and uncertainty-aware transfer paths beyond
interpolation-based augmentation. During this meta-learning process, the model
is optimized such that the update direction on the clean set maximizes the loss
decrease on the noisy set, using pseudo labels derived from the most confident
predicted class for supervision. Experimental results show that EReLiFM
outperforms existing methods on OSDG-NL, achieving state-of-the-art
performance. The source code is available at

Conclusion: CompoDistill是一种有效的知识蒸馏框架，具有通用性，适用于更先进的骨干网络。

Abstract: Recently, efficient Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained
significant attention as a solution to their high computational complexity,
making them more practical for real-world applications. In this regard, the
knowledge distillation (KD) approach has emerged as a promising alternative,
which transfers the rich visual and linguistic knowledge from a larger model
(teacher) to a smaller model (student). However, we observe that existing KD
methods struggle to effectively distill the teacher MLLM's rich visual
perception abilities to the student, a challenge that has been largely
overlooked in previous studies. Through a systematic analysis, we identify
visual attention misalignment between student and teacher as the main cause of
this issue. Based on this insight, we propose CompoDistill, a novel KD
framework that explicitly aligns the student's visual attention with that of
the teacher to enhance the student's visual perception abilities. Our extensive
experiments show that CompoDistill significantly improves performance on
compositional reasoning tasks that require visual perception abilities while
maintaining strong performance on visual question answering tasks, as done in
existing studies. Furthermore, CompoDistill demonstrates effectiveness with a
more advanced backbone, highlighting its generalizability.

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving have been enabled by
training on diverse large-scale driving datasets, yet autonomous driving models
still struggle in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. The COOOL benchmark
targets this gap by encouraging hazard understanding beyond closed taxonomies,
and the 2COOOL challenge extends it to generating human-interpretable incident
reports. We present a hierarchical reasoning framework for incident report
generation from dashcam videos that integrates frame-level captioning, incident
frame detection, and fine-grained reasoning within vision-language models
(VLMs). We further improve factual accuracy and readability through model
ensembling and a Blind A/B Scoring selection protocol. On the official 2COOOL
open leaderboard, our method ranks 2nd among 29 teams and achieves the best
CIDEr-D score, producing accurate and coherent incident narratives. These
results indicate that hierarchical reasoning with VLMs is a promising direction
for accident analysis and for broader understanding of safety-critical traffic
events. The implementation and code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI, particularly in computer vision (CV), offer
new opportunities to optimize workflows across industries, including logistics
and manufacturing. However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of
expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models.
Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning,
which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning
is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This
work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object
detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only,
specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined
the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator
tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios.
It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting,
utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our
findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic
image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of
synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection
models.

Conclusion: DIANet为微表情识别提供了新方向，强调了时间阶段信息的关键作用。

Abstract: Micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that typically last
less than half a second and often reveal genuine emotions. Accurately
recognizing these subtle expressions is critical for applications in
psychology, security, and behavioral analysis. However, micro-expression
recognition (MER) remains a challenging task due to the subtle and transient
nature of facial cues and the limited availability of annotated data. While
dynamic image (DI) representations have been introduced to summarize temporal
motion into a single frame, conventional DI-based methods often overlook the
distinct characteristics of different temporal phases within a
micro-expression. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel
dual-stream framework, DIANet, which leverages phase-aware dynamic images - one
encoding the onset-to-apex phase and the other capturing the apex-to-offset
phase. Each stream is processed by a dedicated convolutional neural network,
and a cross-attention fusion module is employed to adaptively integrate
features from both streams based on their contextual relevance. Extensive
experiments conducted on three benchmark MER datasets (CASME-II, SAMM, and
MMEW) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms
conventional single-phase DI-based approaches. The results highlight the
importance of modeling temporal phase information explicitly and suggest a
promising direction for advancing MER.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have made them highly
effective at reasoning tasks. However, the principles underlying the
construction of performant VL reasoning training datasets remain poorly
understood. In this work, we introduce several data curation approaches and
study their impacts on VL reasoning capabilities by carefully controlling
training and evaluation setups. We analyze the effects of context (image and
question pair) sources, implement targeted data interventions, and explore
scaling up images, questions, and chain-of-thought (CoT) solutions. Our
findings reveal that (a) context source strategies significantly affect VLM
performance, (b) interventions such as auxiliary signals from image captions
and the inclusion of text-only reasoning yield substantial gains, and (c)
scaling all data dimensions (e.g., unique questions per image and unique CoTs
per image-question pair) consistently improves reasoning capability. Motivated
by these insights, we introduce HoneyBee, a large-scale, high-quality CoT
reasoning dataset with 2.5M examples consisting 350K image-question pairs. VLMs
trained with HoneyBee outperform state-of-the-art models across model sizes.
For instance, a HoneyBee-trained VLM with 3B parameters outperforms the SOTA
model and the base model by 7.8% and 24.8%, respectively, on MathVerse.
Furthermore, we propose a test-time scaling strategy that reduces decoding cost
by 73% without sacrificing accuracy. Overall, this work presents improved
strategies for VL reasoning dataset curation research.

Abstract: Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant
interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is
improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps
directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing
fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining
auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step,
reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting
multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to
token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during
training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is
no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method
for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We
achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the
context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our
method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while
significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image
generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video
generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements
across both modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红外小目标检测在无人机多模态感知中至关重要，但面临跨域偏移和噪声扰动的双重挑战。

Method: 1. 使用小波引导的跨域合成生成目标域对齐的训练样本；2. 通过真实域噪声不变性学习构建动态噪声库并学习噪声不变性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多项定量指标上优于现有方法，尤其在跨域场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: Ivan-ISTD框架有效解决了跨域和噪声问题，并构建了动态基准数据集验证其鲁棒性。

Abstract: In the multimedia domain, Infrared Small Target Detection (ISTD) plays a
important role in drone-based multi-modality sensing. To address the dual
challenges of cross-domain shift and heteroscedastic noise perturbations in
ISTD, we propose a doubly wavelet-guided Invariance learning
framework(Ivan-ISTD). In the first stage, we generate training samples aligned
with the target domain using Wavelet-guided Cross-domain Synthesis. This
wavelet-guided alignment machine accurately separates the target background
through multi-frequency wavelet filtering. In the second stage, we introduce
Real-domain Noise Invariance Learning, which extracts real noise
characteristics from the target domain to build a dynamic noise library. The
model learns noise invariance through self-supervised loss, thereby overcoming
the limitations of distribution bias in traditional artificial noise modeling.
Finally, we create the Dynamic-ISTD Benchmark, a cross-domain dynamic
degradation dataset that simulates the distribution shifts encountered in
real-world applications. Additionally, we validate the versatility of our
method using other real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of many
quantitative metrics. In particular, Ivan-ISTD demonstrates excellent
robustness in cross-domain scenarios. The code for this work can be found at:

*Ye Chen,Liming Tan,Yupeng Zhu,Yuanbin Wang,Bingbing Ni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时空一致代理节点的视频表示方法，克服了传统像素级匹配和跟踪的不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频表示依赖像素级匹配和跟踪，容易因跟踪误差、遮挡和大运动导致崩溃。

Method: 使用分层代理节点表示动态变化的视频对象/场景，结合动态更新机制和解耦的形状-纹理编码。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能以较少参数实现高精度视频重建，并支持复杂视频处理任务。

Conclusion: 代理节点方法显著提升了视频表示的鲁棒性和可控性。

Abstract: Current video representations heavily rely on unstable and over-grained
priors for motion and appearance modelling, \emph{i.e.}, pixel-level matching
and tracking. A tracking error of just a few pixels would lead to the collapse
of the visual object representation, not to mention occlusions and large motion
frequently occurring in videos. To overcome the above mentioned vulnerability,
this work proposes spatio-temporally consistent proxy nodes to represent
dynamically changing objects/scenes in the video. On the one hand, the
hierarchical proxy nodes have the ability to stably express the multi-scale
structure of visual objects, so they are not affected by accumulated tracking
error, long-term motion, occlusion, and viewpoint variation. On the other hand,
the dynamic representation update mechanism of the proxy nodes adequately
leverages spatio-temporal priors of the video to mitigate the impact of
inaccurate trackers, thereby effectively handling drastic changes in scenes and
objects. Additionally, the decoupled encoding manner of the shape and texture
representations across different visual objects in the video facilitates
controllable and fine-grained appearance editing capability. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed representation achieves high video
reconstruction accuracy with fewer parameters and supports complex video
processing tasks, including video in-painting and keyframe-based temporally
consistent video editing.

TL;DR: 提出了两种新的损失函数（乘法损失和置信度自适应乘法损失），用于医学和细胞图像的语义分割，解决了传统损失函数在数据稀缺时的性能问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像由于隐私、伦理和标注成本高导致数据稀缺，传统损失函数（如交叉熵和Dice损失）在数据有限时表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的训练目标。

Method: 乘法损失将交叉熵和Dice损失动态结合，基于预测置信度调整梯度；置信度自适应乘法损失进一步引入指数缩放，强调困难样本。

Result: 在细胞和医学图像分割任务中，新损失函数显著优于传统方法，尤其在数据稀缺时表现更稳定。

Conclusion: 新损失函数提供了一种简单、高效且无需超参数调优的机制，适用于数据稀缺的医学图像分割任务。

Abstract: We propose two novel loss functions, Multiplicative Loss and
Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss, for semantic segmentation in medical
and cellular images. Although Cross Entropy and Dice Loss are widely used,
their additive combination is sensitive to hyperparameters and often performs
suboptimally, especially with limited data. Medical images suffer from data
scarcity due to privacy, ethics, and costly annotations, requiring robust and
efficient training objectives. Our Multiplicative Loss combines Cross Entropy
and Dice losses multiplicatively, dynamically modulating gradients based on
prediction confidence. This reduces penalties for confident correct predictions
and amplifies gradients for incorrect overconfident ones, stabilizing
optimization. Building on this, Confidence-Adaptive Multiplicative Loss applies
a confidence-driven exponential scaling inspired by Focal Loss, integrating
predicted probabilities and Dice coefficients to emphasize difficult samples.
This enhances learning under extreme data scarcity by strengthening gradients
when confidence is low. Experiments on cellular and medical segmentation
benchmarks show our framework consistently outperforms tuned additive and
existing loss functions, offering a simple, effective, and hyperparameter-free
mechanism for robust segmentation under challenging data limitations.

Motivation: 解决OOD检测中模型对OOD数据过自信的问题，同时避免高昂的数据收集和训练成本。

Method: 从ID图像中提取背景特征作为伪OOD特征，利用卷积的局部不变性优化模型以减少背景特征的$L_2$-范数。

Result: 在多个标准OOD检测基准上验证了方法的有效性，并与现有方法兼容，达到新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用背景特征有效缓解OOD检测中的过自信问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural
networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their
applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models
often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using
auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD
detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection
and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection
method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model
training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar
background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from
ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the
local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the
$L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to
alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on
multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our
method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods,
with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.

Motivation: 现有无监督融合方法依赖手工设计的损失函数，导致参考图像细节不足、亮度不均，且梯度损失仅关注幅度。

Method: 设计了跨模态互补掩码模块、细粒度参考图像合成策略（结合拉普拉斯边缘增强和自适应直方图均衡化），以及角度感知损失函数。

Result: 在MSRS、RoadScene和M3FD数据集上，AngularFuse显著优于主流方法，生成更清晰、细节更丰富的融合图像。

Conclusion: AngularFuse通过多角度约束和优化策略，显著提升了图像融合的质量和实用性。

Abstract: Visible-infrared image fusion is crucial in key applications such as
autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance. Its main goal is to integrate
multimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for
downstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made
significant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious
challenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually
designed loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss
functions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images
constructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.
On the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient
magnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based
perception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At
first, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network
to learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained
reference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge
enhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer
details and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we
introduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both
gradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.
AngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and
correct edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and
M3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream
methods with clear margin. Visual comparisons further confirm that our method
produces sharper and more detailed results in challenging scenes, demonstrating
superior fusion capability.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估一般医学任务，未能充分覆盖脊柱等依赖视觉输入的细分领域，因此需要专门的评估工具。

Method: 通过整合开源脊柱疾病数据集，构建了包含64,878个QA对的SpineBench，涵盖11种脊柱疾病，并设计了视觉相似的困难负样本以模拟真实场景。

Result: 评估了12个领先的MLLMs，结果显示它们在脊柱任务中表现不佳，揭示了当前模型的局限性。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
into the medical field, comprehensive evaluation of their performance in
various medical domains becomes critical. However, existing benchmarks
primarily assess general medical tasks, inadequately capturing performance in
nuanced areas like the spine, which relies heavily on visual input. To address
this, we introduce SpineBench, a comprehensive Visual Question Answering (VQA)
benchmark designed for fine-grained analysis and evaluation of MLLMs in the
spinal domain. SpineBench comprises 64,878 QA pairs from 40,263 spine images,
covering 11 spinal diseases through two critical clinical tasks: spinal disease
diagnosis and spinal lesion localization, both in multiple-choice format.
SpineBench is built by integrating and standardizing image-label pairs from
open-source spinal disease datasets, and samples challenging hard negative
options for each VQA pair based on visual similarity (similar but not the same
disease), simulating real-world challenging scenarios. We evaluate 12 leading
MLLMs on SpineBench. The results reveal that these models exhibit poor
performance in spinal tasks, highlighting limitations of current MLLM in the
spine domain and guiding future improvements in spinal medicine applications.

Motivation: 现有方法在动态3D城市场景重建中存在保真度与计算成本的权衡问题，缺乏语义感知。

Result: 在Waymo和KITTI数据集上，PAGS显著提升重建质量，渲染速度超过350 FPS。

Conclusion: PAGS通过语义优先级优化，有效解决了重建效率与质量的矛盾。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D urban scenes is crucial for autonomous driving, yet
current methods face a stark trade-off between fidelity and computational cost.
This inefficiency stems from their semantically agnostic design, which
allocates resources uniformly, treating static backgrounds and safety-critical
objects with equal importance. To address this, we introduce Priority-Adaptive
Gaussian Splatting (PAGS), a framework that injects task-aware semantic
priorities directly into the 3D reconstruction and rendering pipeline. PAGS
introduces two core contributions: (1) Semantically-Guided Pruning and
Regularization strategy, which employs a hybrid importance metric to
aggressively simplify non-critical scene elements while preserving fine-grained
details on objects vital for navigation. (2) Priority-Driven Rendering
pipeline, which employs a priority-based depth pre-pass to aggressively cull
occluded primitives and accelerate the final shading computations. Extensive
experiments on the Waymo and KITTI datasets demonstrate that PAGS achieves
exceptional reconstruction quality, particularly on safety-critical objects,
while significantly reducing training time and boosting rendering speeds to
over 350 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DL-DKD++的双学习框架，用于解决部分相关视频检索（PRVR）任务，通过动态知识蒸馏提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检索方法假设视频已修剪且内容简短，而实际视频通常未修剪且背景复杂，因此需要更实用的PRVR方法。

Method: 采用双学习框架（DL-DKD++），结合大模型的知识蒸馏和轻量级学生网络的双分支设计，动态软目标机制优化学习。

Result: 在TVR、ActivityNet和Charades-STA数据集上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: DL-DKD++通过动态知识蒸馏和双分支设计，有效解决了PRVR任务，提升了检索性能。

Abstract: Almost all previous text-to-video retrieval works ideally assume that videos
are pre-trimmed with short durations containing solely text-related content.
However, in practice, videos are typically untrimmed in long durations with
much more complicated background content. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on
the more practical yet challenging task of Partially Relevant Video Retrieval
(PRVR), which aims to retrieve partially relevant untrimmed videos with the
given query. To tackle this task, we propose a novel framework that distills
generalization knowledge from a powerful large-scale vision-language
pre-trained model and transfers it to a lightweight, task-specific PRVR
network. Specifically, we introduce a Dual Learning framework with Dynamic
Knowledge Distillation (DL-DKD++), where a large teacher model provides
supervision to a compact dual-branch student network. The student model
comprises two branches: an inheritance branch that absorbs transferable
knowledge from the teacher, and an exploration branch that learns task-specific
information from the PRVR dataset to address domain gaps. To further enhance
learning, we incorporate a dynamic soft-target construction mechanism. By
replacing rigid hard-target supervision with adaptive soft targets that evolve
during training, our method enables the model to better capture the
fine-grained, partial relevance between videos and queries. Experiment results
demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
TVR, ActivityNet, and Charades-STA datasets for PRVR. The code is available at

Motivation: VLMs在多模态推理中表现优异，但容易产生幻觉输出，尤其是在无文字标志上生成品牌名称或文本内容的问题尚未被充分研究。

Method: 通过纯符号、混合和含文本标志的分割集及Hard-60子集，系统测量VLMs的幻觉现象，并分析嵌入层和投影器维度的影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了VLMs的幻觉机制，提出了投影器解耦和OCR引导解码作为改进方向，以构建更可靠的多模态系统。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multimodal
reasoning; yet, they remain vulnerable to hallucinations, where outputs are not
grounded in visual evidence. In this paper, we investigate a previously
overlooked setting: logo hallucination, where models generate brand names or
textual content despite logos containing no visible words. Using curated splits
of pure symbols, hybrids, and text-bearing logos, as well as the challenging
Hard-60 subset, we systematically measure hallucination across leading VLMs. We
further probe robustness through nine structured perturbations and show that
hallucinations persist even under strong distortions, with occlusion exposing
the sharpest weaknesses. Embedding-level analysis with open-weight LLaVA
demonstrates that hallucination is tied to a small subset of projector
dimensions, and targeted ablation substantially reduces errors while preserving
OCR accuracy. Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic
priors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular
logos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.
Our work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation
insights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as
promising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.

Abstract: This paper describes the Qualcomm AI Research solution to the RealADSim-NVS
challenge, hosted at the RealADSim Workshop at ICCV 2025. The challenge
concerns novel view synthesis in street scenes, and participants are required
to generate, starting from car-centric frames captured during some training
traversals, renders of the same urban environment as viewed from a different
traversal (e.g. different street lane or car direction). Our solution is
inspired by hybrid methods in scene generation and generative simulators
merging gaussian splatting and diffusion models, and it is composed of two
stages: First, we fit a 3D reconstruction of the scene and render novel views
as seen from the target cameras. Then, we enhance the resulting frames with a
dedicated single-step diffusion model. We discuss specific choices made in the
initialization of gaussian primitives as well as the finetuning of the enhancer
model and its training data curation. We report the performance of our model
design and we ablate its components in terms of novel view quality as measured
by PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS. On the public leaderboard reporting test results, our
proposal reaches an aggregated score of 0.432, achieving the second place

Result: 在SemanticKITTI基准测试中达到16.9的平均IoU，性能领先。

Conclusion: CurriFlow的运动引导和课程感知设计有效提升了相机基3D语义场景补全的性能。

Abstract: Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) aims to infer complete 3D geometry and
semantics from monocular images, serving as a crucial capability for
camera-based perception in autonomous driving. However, existing SSC methods
relying on temporal stacking or depth projection often lack explicit motion
reasoning and struggle with occlusions and noisy depth supervision. We propose
CurriFlow, a novel semantic occupancy prediction framework that integrates
optical flow-based temporal alignment with curriculum-guided depth fusion.
CurriFlow employs a multi-level fusion strategy to align segmentation, visual,
and depth features across frames using pre-trained optical flow, thereby
improving temporal consistency and dynamic object understanding. To enhance
geometric robustness, a curriculum learning mechanism progressively transitions
from sparse yet accurate LiDAR depth to dense but noisy stereo depth during
training, ensuring stable optimization and seamless adaptation to real-world
deployment. Furthermore, semantic priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
provide category-agnostic supervision, strengthening voxel-level semantic
learning and spatial consistency. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI benchmark
demonstrate that CurriFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance with a mean
IoU of 16.9, validating the effectiveness of our motion-guided and
curriculum-aware design for camera-based 3D semantic scene completion.

Abstract: Although deep neural networks have provided impressive gains in performance,
these improvements often come at the cost of increased computational complexity
and expense. In many cases, such as 3D volume or video classification tasks,
not all slices or frames are necessary due to inherent redundancies. To address
this issue, we propose a novel learnable subsampling framework that can be
integrated into any neural network architecture. Subsampling, being a
nondifferentiable operation, poses significant challenges for direct adaptation
into deep learning models. While some works, have proposed solutions using the
Gumbel-max trick to overcome the problem of non-differentiability, they fall
short in a crucial aspect: they are only task-adaptive and not inputadaptive.
Once the sampling mechanism is learned, it remains static and does not adjust
to different inputs, making it unsuitable for real-world applications. To this
end, we propose an attention-guided sampling module that adapts to inputs even
during inference. This dynamic adaptation results in performance gains and
reduces complexity in deep neural network models. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method on 3D medical imaging datasets from MedMNIST3D as
well as two ultrasound video datasets for classification tasks, one of them
being a challenging in-house dataset collected under real-world clinical
conditions.

TL;DR: STORM-PSR提出了一种双流框架，结合空间和时间特征，显著提升了步骤识别的准确性和鲁棒性，尤其在部分遮挡情况下。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅依赖单帧物体状态检测，忽略了时间特征，导致在遮挡情况下性能受限。

Method: 采用双流框架：空间状态检测流处理无遮挡视图，时空流结合空间编码器和基于Transformer的时间编码器处理遮挡情况。

Result: 在MECCANO和IndustReal数据集上，平均延迟分别降低了11.2%和26.1%。

Conclusion: STORM-PSR通过时空流显著提升了遮挡情况下的步骤识别性能，代码和标注数据已开源。

Abstract: Procedure step recognition (PSR) aims to identify all correctly completed
steps and their sequential order in videos of procedural tasks. The existing
state-of-the-art models rely solely on detecting assembly object states in
individual video frames. By neglecting temporal features, model robustness and
accuracy are limited, especially when objects are partially occluded. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Occlusion-Resilient
Modeling for Procedure Step Recognition (STORM-PSR), a dual-stream framework
for PSR that leverages both spatial and temporal features. The assembly state
detection stream operates effectively with unobstructed views of the object,
while the spatio-temporal stream captures both spatial and temporal features to
recognize step completions even under partial occlusion. This stream includes a
spatial encoder, pre-trained using a novel weakly supervised approach to
capture meaningful spatial representations, and a transformer-based temporal
encoder that learns how these spatial features relate over time. STORM-PSR is
evaluated on the MECCANO and IndustReal datasets, reducing the average delay
between actual and predicted assembly step completions by 11.2% and 26.1%,
respectively, compared to prior methods. We demonstrate that this reduction in
delay is driven by the spatio-temporal stream, which does not rely on
unobstructed views of the object to infer completed steps. The code for
STORM-PSR, along with the newly annotated MECCANO labels, is made publicly
available at https://timschoonbeek.github.io/stormpsr .

TL;DR: 提出了一种概率重解释方法，通过引入高级重建先验提升场景坐标回归模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SCR模型在训练图像多视角约束不足时性能退化的问题。

Method: 采用概率重解释方法，结合多种先验（如深度分布先验和学习的场景坐标配置先验），并使用3D点云扩散模型增强几何合理性。

Result: 在三个室内数据集上，先验方法提升了场景表示质量，改善了点云一致性、注册率和相机位姿，对下游任务如新视角合成和相机重定位有积极影响。

Conclusion: 通过引入高级重建先验，SCR模型的性能在多视角约束不足时得到显著提升。

Abstract: Scene coordinate regression (SCR) models have proven to be powerful implicit
scene representations for 3D vision, enabling visual relocalization and
structure-from-motion. SCR models are trained specifically for one scene. If
training images imply insufficient multi-view constraints SCR models
degenerate. We present a probabilistic reinterpretation of training SCR models,
which allows us to infuse high-level reconstruction priors. We investigate
multiple such priors, ranging from simple priors over the distribution of
reconstructed depth values to learned priors over plausible scene coordinate
configurations. For the latter, we train a 3D point cloud diffusion model on a
large corpus of indoor scans. Our priors push predicted 3D scene points towards
plausible geometry at each training step to increase their likelihood. On three
indoor datasets our priors help learning better scene representations,
resulting in more coherent scene point clouds, higher registration rates and
better camera poses, with a positive effect on down-stream tasks such as novel
view synthesis and camera relocalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市基础设施监测面临多样性挑战，现有方法成本高且难以扩展，VLMs因其视觉与语言结合的能力成为潜在解决方案。

Method: 采用PRISMA方法系统综述了2021-2025年的32项研究，聚焦于VLMs的任务、架构、数据集和评估。

Result: 总结了VLMs在城市监测中的有效任务、常用架构、支持数据集及性能表现。

Conclusion: VLMs在城市监测中展现出潜力，但仍需进一步研究以优化性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Urban monitoring of public infrastructure (such as waste bins, road signs,
vegetation, sidewalks, and construction sites) poses significant challenges due
to the diversity of objects, environments, and contextual conditions involved.
Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on a combination of IoT
sensors and manual inspections, which are costly, difficult to scale, and often
misaligned with citizens' perception formed through direct visual observation.
This raises a critical question: Can machines now "see" like citizens and infer
informed opinions about the condition of urban infrastructure? Vision-Language
Models (VLMs), which integrate visual understanding with natural language
reasoning, have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in processing
complex visual information, turning them into a promising technology to address
this challenge. This systematic review investigates the role of VLMs in urban
monitoring, with particular emphasis on zero-shot applications. Following the
PRISMA methodology, we analyzed 32 peer-reviewed studies published between 2021
and 2025 to address four core research questions: (1) What urban monitoring
tasks have been effectively addressed using VLMs? (2) Which VLM architectures
and frameworks are most commonly used and demonstrate superior performance? (3)
What datasets and resources support this emerging field? (4) How are VLM-based
applications evaluated, and what performance levels have been reported?

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件流匹配（CFM）的图像质量转移新框架，用于从低场MRI重建高质量图像，性能优越且参数较少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低场MRI（LF-MRI）成本低且便携，但信噪比低，诊断质量差，需要一种方法在不增加基础设施成本的情况下提升图像质量。

Method: 通过条件流匹配（CFM）直接回归最优速度场，学习噪声分布与目标数据分布之间的连续流，避免了传统生成模型的迭代采样或对抗目标。

Result: 实验表明，CFM在低场MRI重建中不仅达到最先进性能，还能泛化到分布内外数据，且参数远少于其他深度学习方法。

Conclusion: CFM是一种强大且可扩展的MRI重建工具，特别适合资源有限的临床环境。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for image quality transfer based on
conditional flow matching (CFM). Unlike conventional generative models that
rely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous
flow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the
direct regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in
the context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly
emerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from
inherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality. Our
framework is designed to reconstruct high-field-like MR images from their
corresponding low-field inputs, thereby bridging the quality gap without
requiring expensive infrastructure. Experiments demonstrate that CFM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance, but also generalizes robustly to both
in-distribution and out-of-distribution data. Importantly, it does so while
utilizing significantly fewer parameters than competing deep learning methods.
These results underline the potential of CFM as a powerful and scalable tool
for MRI reconstruction, particularly in resource-limited clinical environments.

TL;DR: VideoLucy是一个基于深度记忆回溯的框架，用于长视频理解，通过分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制解决现有方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的代理系统在长视频理解中面临无法捕捉时间上下文和稀疏采样导致信息丢失的问题。

Method: 采用分层记忆结构和迭代回溯机制，从粗到细逐步挖掘视频范围内的相关信息。

Result: VideoLucy在多个长视频理解基准上显著优于现有方法，甚至超越GPT-4o等专有模型。

Conclusion: VideoLucy通过深度记忆回溯有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，并提供了新的基准EgoMem。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that agent-based systems leveraging large language
models (LLMs) for key information retrieval and integration have emerged as a
promising approach for long video understanding. However, these systems face
two major challenges. First, they typically perform modeling and reasoning on
individual frames, struggling to capture the temporal context of consecutive
frames. Second, to reduce the cost of dense frame-level captioning, they adopt
sparse frame sampling, which risks discarding crucial information. To overcome
these limitations, we propose VideoLucy, a deep memory backtracking framework
for long video understanding. Inspired by the human recollection process from
coarse to fine, VideoLucy employs a hierarchical memory structure with
progressive granularity. This structure explicitly defines the detail level and
temporal scope of memory at different hierarchical depths. Through an
agent-based iterative backtracking mechanism, VideoLucy systematically mines
video-wide, question-relevant deep memories until sufficient information is
gathered to provide a confident answer. This design enables effective temporal
understanding of consecutive frames while preserving critical details. In
addition, we introduce EgoMem, a new benchmark for long video understanding.
EgoMem is designed to comprehensively evaluate a model's ability to understand
complex events that unfold over time and capture fine-grained details in
extremely long videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of
VideoLucy. Built on open-source models, VideoLucy significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods on multiple long video understanding benchmarks,
achieving performance even surpassing the latest proprietary models such as
GPT-4o. Our code and dataset will be made publicly at

Conclusion: 论文总结了当前研究的五大局限，并提出了未来发展的方向，为这一新兴领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Chest Xray imaging is a widely used diagnostic tool in modern medicine, and
its high utilization creates substantial workloads for radiologists. To
alleviate this burden, vision language models are increasingly applied to
automate Chest Xray radiology report generation (CXRRRG), aiming for clinically
accurate descriptions while reducing manual effort. Conventional approaches,
however, typically rely on single images, failing to capture the longitudinal
context necessary for producing clinically faithful comparison statements.
Recently, growing attention has been directed toward incorporating longitudinal
data into CXR RRG, enabling models to leverage historical studies in ways that
mirror radiologists diagnostic workflows. Nevertheless, existing surveys
primarily address single image CXRRRG and offer limited guidance for
longitudinal settings, leaving researchers without a systematic framework for
model design. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive
review of longitudinal radiology report generation (LRRG). Specifically, we
examine dataset construction strategies, report generation architectures
alongside longitudinally tailored designs, and evaluation protocols
encompassing both longitudinal specific measures and widely used benchmarks. We
further summarize LRRG methods performance, alongside analyses of different
ablation studies, which collectively highlight the critical role of
longitudinal information and architectural design choices in improving model
performance. Finally, we summarize five major limitations of current research
and outline promising directions for future development, aiming to lay a
foundation for advancing this emerging field.

Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在深度伪造检测器中难以同时实现高转移性和视觉不可察觉性。

Method: 第一阶段使用双流攻击模块生成对抗候选样本（MNTD-PGD和SG-PGD），第二阶段通过度量感知选择模块优化转移性和不可察觉性。

Result: MS-GAGA在未见过的检测器上实现了比现有攻击方法高27%的误分类率。

Conclusion: MS-GAGA通过两阶段设计有效提升了对抗样本的转移性和视觉不可察觉性。

Abstract: We present MS-GAGA (Metric-Selective Guided Adversarial Generation Attack), a
two-stage framework for crafting transferable and visually imperceptible
adversarial examples against deepfake detectors in black-box settings. In Stage
1, a dual-stream attack module generates adversarial candidates: MNTD-PGD
applies enhanced gradient calculations optimized for small perturbation
budgets, while SG-PGD focuses perturbations on visually salient regions. This
complementary design expands the adversarial search space and improves
transferability across unseen models. In Stage 2, a metric-aware selection
module evaluates candidates based on both their success against black-box
models and their structural similarity (SSIM) to the original image. By jointly
optimizing transferability and imperceptibility, MS-GAGA achieves up to 27%
higher misclassification rates on unseen detectors compared to state-of-the-art
attacks.

Abstract: Deep learning relies heavily on data augmentation to mitigate limited data,
especially in medical imaging. Recent multimodal learning integrates text and
images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation.
However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial
alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we
propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before
augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight
generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic
gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region
localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four
segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results. Code is publicly

Result: 实验验证了该方法的有效性，并显示其优于现有技术。

Conclusion: BSGS通过两阶段优化和动态调整策略，显著提升了运动模糊图像下的3D场景重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting has exhibited remarkable capabilities in 3D scene
reconstruction.However, reconstructing high-quality 3D scenes from
motion-blurred images caused by camera motion poses a significant challenge.The
performance of existing 3DGS-based deblurring methods are limited due to their
inherent mechanisms, such as extreme dependence on the accuracy of camera poses
and inability to effectively control erroneous Gaussian primitives
densification caused by motion blur.To solve these problems, we introduce a
novel framework, Bi-Stage 3D Gaussian Splatting, to accurately reconstruct 3D
scenes from motion-blurred images.BSGS contains two stages. First, Camera Pose
Refinement roughly optimizes camera poses to reduce motion-induced distortions.
Second, with fixed rough camera poses, Global RigidTransformation further
corrects motion-induced blur distortions.To alleviate multi-subframe gradient
conflicts, we propose a subframe gradient aggregation strategy to optimize both
stages.Furthermore, a space-time bi-stage optimization strategy is introduced
to dynamically adjust primitive densification thresholds and prevent premature
noisy Gaussian generation in blurred regions. Comprehensive experiments verify
the effectiveness of our proposed deblurring method and show its superiority
over the state of the arts.

Motivation: 现有神经方法在学习UDF时存在数值不稳定、计算成本高和可控性差的问题，需要一种更高效稳定的替代方案。

Method: 通过Voronoi几何准则为输入点分配双向法线，扩散形成近似UDF梯度场，最终积分得到UDF。

Result: VAD能稳定处理水密、开放表面及复杂非流形和非定向几何，计算高效。

Conclusion: VAD提供了一种高效稳定的UDF计算方法，适用于多种复杂几何结构。

Abstract: Unsigned Distance Fields (UDFs) provide a flexible representation for 3D
shapes with arbitrary topology, including open and closed surfaces, orientable
and non-orientable geometries, and non-manifold structures. While recent neural
approaches have shown promise in learning UDFs, they often suffer from
numerical instability, high computational cost, and limited controllability. We
present a lightweight, network-free method, Voronoi-Assisted Diffusion (VAD),
for computing UDFs directly from unoriented point clouds. Our approach begins
by assigning bi-directional normals to input points, guided by two
Voronoi-based geometric criteria encoded in an energy function for optimal
alignment. The aligned normals are then diffused to form an approximate UDF
gradient field, which is subsequently integrated to recover the final UDF.
Experiments demonstrate that VAD robustly handles watertight and open surfaces,
as well as complex non-manifold and non-orientable geometries, while remaining
computationally efficient and stable.

Conclusion: 通过理论驱动的组件设计和针对性消融实验，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Recent work has explored a range of model families for human motion
generation, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), and diffusion-based models. Despite their differences, many
methods rely on over-parameterized input features and auxiliary losses to
improve empirical results. These strategies should not be strictly necessary
for diffusion models to match the human motion distribution. We show that on
par with state-of-the-art results in unconditional human motion generation are
achievable with a score-based diffusion model using only careful feature-space
normalization and analytically derived weightings for the standard L2
score-matching loss, while generating both motion and shape directly, thereby
avoiding slow post hoc shape recovery from joints. We build the method step by
step, with a clear theoretical motivation for each component, and provide
targeted ablations demonstrating the effectiveness of each proposed addition in
isolation.

Result: 多光谱输入显著优于RGB基线，尤其对小目标和密集场景。

Conclusion: MMOT推动了无人机多光谱多目标跟踪研究，数据集和代码已开源。

Abstract: Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to
small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based
tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and
texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability.
Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides
crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial
conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has
hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the
first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object
tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video
sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii)
Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small
targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and
(iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced
ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and
leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and
orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a
lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving
compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for
precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive
transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently
show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB
baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our
work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our
MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at

Conclusion: Temporally Conditional Mamba在人体运动生成任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Learning human motion based on a time-dependent input signal presents a
challenging yet impactful task with various applications. The goal of this task
is to generate or estimate human movement that consistently reflects the
temporal patterns of conditioning inputs. Existing methods typically rely on
cross-attention mechanisms to fuse the condition with motion. However, this
approach primarily captures global interactions and struggles to maintain
step-by-step temporal alignment. To address this limitation, we introduce
Temporally Conditional Mamba, a new mamba-based model for human motion
generation. Our approach integrates conditional information into the recurrent
dynamics of the Mamba block, enabling better temporally aligned motion. To
validate the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on a variety of human
motion tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly
improves temporal alignment, motion realism, and condition consistency over
state-of-the-art approaches. Our project page is available at

Abstract: We present a zero-shot segmentation approach for agricultural imagery that
leverages Plantnet, a large-scale plant classification model, in conjunction
with its DinoV2 backbone and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Rather than
collecting and annotating new datasets, our method exploits Plantnet's
specialized plant representations to identify plant regions and produce coarse
segmentation masks. These masks are then refined by SAM to yield detailed
segmentations. We evaluate on four publicly available datasets of various
complexity in terms of contrast including some where the limited size of the
training data and complex field conditions often hinder purely supervised
methods. Our results show consistent performance gains when using
Plantnet-fine-tuned DinoV2 over the base DinoV2 model, as measured by the
Jaccard Index (IoU). These findings highlight the potential of combining
foundation models with specialized plant-centric models to alleviate the
annotation bottleneck and enable effective segmentation in diverse agricultural
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有研究表明扩散模型的生成质量与中间表示相关，但需要外部指导。LayerSync旨在通过模型自身表示减少对外部监督的依赖。

Result: 在图像生成等领域显著提升训练效率（如8.75倍加速）和生成质量（如23.6%提升）。

Conclusion: LayerSync是一种通用、高效的方法，适用于多种模态，无需额外数据或预训练模型。

Abstract: We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation
quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have
highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the
representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on
model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize
this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate
representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies
across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich
representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the
need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient,
plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and
generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no
pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on
image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as
audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the
generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the
training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and
improved the generation quality by 23.6%. The code is available at

Method: 采用两阶段训练：第一阶段预训练编码器捕捉语义信息并与采样轨迹对齐；第二阶段端到端微调完整模型。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上表现优异，扩散模型FID达2.04（256分辨率）和2.35（512分辨率），一致性模型单步FID为8.82。

Conclusion: 该框架首次成功在高分辨率图像上直接训练一致性模型，无需依赖预训练的VAE或扩散模型。

Abstract: Pixel-space generative models are often more difficult to train and generally
underperform compared to their latent-space counterparts, leaving a persistent
performance and efficiency gap. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage
training framework that closes this gap for pixel-space diffusion and
consistency models. In the first stage, we pre-train encoders to capture
meaningful semantics from clean images while aligning them with points along
the same deterministic sampling trajectory, which evolves points from the prior
to the data distribution. In the second stage, we integrate the encoder with a
randomly initialized decoder and fine-tune the complete model end-to-end for
both diffusion and consistency models. Our training framework demonstrates
strong empirical performance on ImageNet dataset. Specifically, our diffusion
model reaches an FID of 2.04 on ImageNet-256 and 2.35 on ImageNet-512 with 75
number of function evaluations (NFE), surpassing prior pixel-space methods by a
large margin in both generation quality and efficiency while rivaling leading
VAE-based models at comparable training cost. Furthermore, on ImageNet-256, our
consistency model achieves an impressive FID of 8.82 in a single sampling step,
significantly surpassing its latent-space counterpart. To the best of our
knowledge, this marks the first successful training of a consistency model
directly on high-resolution images without relying on pre-trained VAEs or
diffusion models.

TL;DR: IVT-LR是一种多模态潜在推理方法，通过隐式结合视觉和文本信息提升推理效率，减少标注需求，并在准确性和速度上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态推理方法依赖显式推理步骤，需要大量标注且推理延迟高，IVT-LR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出IVT-LR方法，在潜在空间中结合隐式文本和视觉信息进行推理，并采用渐进式多阶段训练策略。

Result: 在M3CoT和ScienceQA数据集上，IVT-LR平均准确率提升5.45%，推理速度提升5倍以上。

Conclusion: IVT-LR通过潜在空间推理有效提升了多模态推理的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning aims to enhance the capabilities of MLLMs by
incorporating intermediate reasoning steps before reaching the final answer. It
has evolved from text-only reasoning to the integration of visual information,
enabling the thought process to be conveyed through both images and text.
Despite its effectiveness, current multimodal reasoning methods depend on
explicit reasoning steps that require labor-intensive vision-text annotations
and inherently introduce significant inference latency. To address these
issues, we introduce multimodal latent reasoning with the advantages of
multimodal representation, reduced annotation, and inference efficiency. To
facilicate it, we propose Interleaved Vision-Text Latent Reasoning (IVT-LR),
which injects both visual and textual information in the reasoning process
within the latent space. Specifically, IVT-LR represents each reasoning step by
combining two implicit parts: latent text (the hidden states from the previous
step) and latent vision (a set of selected image embeddings). We further
introduce a progressive multi-stage training strategy to enable MLLMs to
perform the above multimodal latent reasoning steps. Experiments on M3CoT and
ScienceQA demonstrate that our IVT-LR method achieves an average performance
increase of 5.45% in accuracy, while simultaneously achieving a speed increase
of over 5 times compared to existing approaches. Code available at

Motivation: 现有方法常忽略水下成像的物理原理或简单将退化现象视为干扰因素，未能充分利用其包含的有价值信息。

Method: 提出WaterFlow框架，将水下物理成像信息作为显式先验直接融入网络训练过程，并引入时间维度建模。

Result: 在USOD10K数据集上，WaterFlow的S_m指标提升了0.072。

Conclusion: WaterFlow通过结合物理成像信息和时间建模，有效提升了水下显著目标检测的性能。

Abstract: Underwater Salient Object Detection (USOD) faces significant challenges,
including underwater image quality degradation and domain gaps. Existing
methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply
treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that
must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they
contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater
salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical
imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training
process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the
model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset,
WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and
superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于跨频一致性的零样本去噪方法（ZSCFC），无需依赖噪声分布假设，仅需单张噪声图像即可高效去噪。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零样本去噪方法训练时间长且依赖噪声独立性和零均值假设，难以应对真实复杂噪声场景。

Method: 利用图像纹理在不同频段的相似性和一致性，设计跨频一致性损失和超轻量网络实现去噪。

Result: 在多个真实图像数据集上，ZSCFC在计算效率和去噪性能上优于其他先进方法。

Conclusion: ZSCFC为真实场景去噪提供了一种高效且不依赖噪声假设的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot denoisers address the dataset dependency of deep-learning-based
denoisers, enabling the denoising of unseen single images. Nonetheless,
existing zero-shot methods suffer from long training times and rely on the
assumption of noise independence and a zero-mean property, limiting their
effectiveness in real-world denoising scenarios where noise characteristics are
more complicated. This paper proposes an efficient and effective method for
real-world denoising, the Zero-Shot denoiser based on Cross-Frequency
Consistency (ZSCFC), which enables training and denoising with a single noisy
image and does not rely on assumptions about noise distribution. Specifically,
image textures exhibit position similarity and content consistency across
different frequency bands, while noise does not. Based on this property, we
developed cross-frequency consistency loss and an ultralight network to realize
image denoising. Experiments on various real-world image datasets demonstrate
that our ZSCFC outperforms other state-of-the-art zero-shot methods in terms of
computational efficiency and denoising performance.

Motivation: 现有HMR方法依赖大型非分层视觉变换器，计算成本高。通过利用分层VFMs的早期阶段特征，可以提升效率同时保持性能。

Method: 构建三种轻量级HMR2.0变体，并采用Swin Transformer等分层VFMs的前两或三个阶段作为编码器。

Result: 27个分层VFM模型评估显示，仅用早期阶段即可达到全阶段模型的性能，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: 分层VFMs的早期阶段在HMR和HPE任务中实现了更好的准确性与计算效率的平衡。

Abstract: In this work, we aim to develop simple and efficient models for human mesh
recovery (HMR) and its predecessor task, human pose estimation (HPE).
State-of-the-art HMR methods, such as HMR2.0 and its successors, rely on large,
non-hierarchical vision transformers as encoders, which are inherited from the
corresponding HPE models like ViTPose. To establish baselines across varying
computational budgets, we first construct three lightweight HMR2.0 variants by
adapting the corresponding ViTPose models. In addition, we propose leveraging
the early stages of hierarchical vision foundation models (VFMs), including
Swin Transformer, GroupMixFormer, and VMamba, as encoders. This design is
motivated by the observation that intermediate stages of hierarchical VFMs
produce feature maps with resolutions comparable to or higher than those of
non-hierarchical counterparts. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 27
hierarchical-VFM-based HMR and HPE models, demonstrating that using only the
first two or three stages achieves performance on par with full-stage models.
Moreover, we show that the resulting truncated models exhibit better trade-offs
between accuracy and computational efficiency compared to existing lightweight
alternatives.

Motivation: 地球观测数据量大且存储传输成本高，现有压缩方法未能充分利用时序冗余或适应多光谱数据。

Method: 提出 TEC 系列算法，包括多光谱图像压缩和时序 Transformer 模型 (TEC-TT)，并引入 Latent Repacking 技术实现灵活速率压缩。

Result: 在 Sentinel-2 数据上，TEC 压缩效率比传统方法高 3-10 倍，且 TEC-TT 在云修复任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: TEC 展示了定制化学习压缩算法在地球观测中的潜力，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Earth observation (EO) satellites produce massive streams of multispectral
image time series, posing pressing challenges for storage and transmission.
Yet, learned EO compression remains fragmented, lacking publicly available
pretrained models and misaligned with advances in compression for natural
imagery. Image codecs overlook temporal redundancy, while video codecs rely on
motion priors that fail to capture the radiometric evolution of largely static
scenes. We introduce TerraCodec (TEC), a family of learned codecs tailored to
EO. TEC includes efficient image-based variants adapted to multispectral
inputs, as well as a Temporal Transformer model (TEC-TT) that leverages
dependencies across time. To overcome the fixed-rate setting of today's neural
codecs, we present Latent Repacking, a novel method for training flexible-rate
transformer models that operate on varying rate-distortion settings. Trained on
Sentinel-2 data, TerraCodec outperforms classical codecs, achieving 3-10x
stronger compression at equivalent image quality. Beyond compression, TEC-TT
enables zero-shot cloud inpainting, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the
AllClear benchmark. Our results establish bespoke, learned compression
algorithms as a promising direction for Earth observation. Code and model
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Result: 在三个扩展数据集上验证，方法在准确性和通信开销上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在无人机群协作感知中实现了最先进的性能，同时大幅降低了通信开销。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) swarm systems necessitate efficient
collaborative perception mechanisms for diverse operational scenarios. Current
Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based approaches exhibit two main limitations:
bounding-box representations fail to capture complete semantic and geometric
information of the scene, and their performance significantly degrades when
encountering undefined or occluded objects. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel multi-UAV collaborative occupancy prediction framework. Our
framework effectively preserves 3D spatial structures and semantics through
integrating a Spatial-Aware Feature Encoder and Cross-Agent Feature
Integration. To enhance efficiency, we further introduce Altitude-Aware Feature
Reduction to compactly represent scene information, along with a Dual-Mask
Perceptual Guidance mechanism to adaptively select features and reduce
communication overhead. Due to the absence of suitable benchmark datasets, we
extend three datasets for evaluation: two virtual datasets (Air-to-Pred-Occ and
UAV3D-Occ) and one real-world dataset (GauUScene-Occ). Experiments results
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly
outperforming existing collaborative methods while reducing communication
overhead to only a fraction of previous approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型在医学影像中表现优异，但易学习虚假相关性，导致偏差和泛化能力有限。人工监督成本高，需更高效方法。

Method: H-EGL框架结合自监督和人工引导约束，利用类区分注意力提升鲁棒性和灵活性。

Result: 在胸片分类任务中，H-EGL优于两种先进方法，分类准确率和泛化能力更优，注意力图与人类专家更一致。

Conclusion: H-EGL有效提升模型性能，减少偏差，且无需高成本人工监督。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have demonstrated exceptional
performance in medical imaging by leveraging attention mechanisms for feature
representation and interpretability. However, these models are prone to
learning spurious correlations, leading to biases and limited generalization.
While human-AI attention alignment can mitigate these issues, it often depends
on costly manual supervision. In this work, we propose a Hybrid
Explanation-Guided Learning (H-EGL) framework that combines self-supervised and
human-guided constraints to enhance attention alignment and improve
generalization. The self-supervised component of H-EGL leverages
class-distinctive attention without relying on restrictive priors, promoting
robustness and flexibility. We validate our approach on chest X-ray
classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT), where H-EGL outperforms two
state-of-the-art Explanation-Guided Learning (EGL) methods, demonstrating
superior classification accuracy and generalization capability. Additionally,
it produces attention maps that are better aligned with human expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准多关注静态图像处理，而动态视觉任务（如编辑、增强）在现实场景中更为重要，但研究不足。

Method: 引入IRIS基准，包含1,204个开放式的视觉任务，涵盖五个领域，评估MLLMs的感知、转换和推理能力。

Result: 当前MLLMs表现较差，最强模型（GPT-5-think）通过率仅18.68%，且不同模型在工具使用上存在差异。

Conclusion: IRIS为动态视觉任务提供了首个基准，揭示了MLLMs在视觉智能方面的不足，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly applied in
real-world scenarios where user-provided images are often imperfect, requiring
active image manipulations such as cropping, editing, or enhancement to uncover
salient visual cues. Beyond static visual perception, MLLMs must also think
with images: dynamically transforming visual content and integrating it with
other tools to solve complex tasks. However, this shift from treating vision as
passive context to a manipulable cognitive workspace remains underexplored.
Most existing benchmarks still follow a think about images paradigm, where
images are regarded as static inputs. To address this gap, we introduce IRIS,
an Interactive Reasoning with Images and Systems that evaluates MLLMs' ability
to perceive, transform, and reason across complex visual-textual tasks under
the think with images paradigm. IRIS comprises 1,204 challenging, open-ended
vision tasks (603 single-turn, 601 multi-turn) spanning across five diverse
domains, each paired with detailed rubrics to enable systematic evaluation. Our
evaluation shows that current MLLMs struggle with tasks requiring effective
integration of vision and general-purpose tools. Even the strongest model
(GPT-5-think) reaches only 18.68% pass rate. We further observe divergent
tool-use behaviors, with OpenAI models benefiting from diverse image
manipulations while Gemini-2.5-pro shows no improvement. By introducing the
first benchmark centered on think with images, IRIS offers critical insights
for advancing visual intelligence in MLLMs.

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用多方数据，同时保护隐私，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Foundation models open up new possibilities for the use of AI in healthcare.
However, even when pre-trained on health data, they still need to be fine-tuned
for specific downstream tasks. Furthermore, although foundation models reduce
the amount of training data required to achieve good performance, obtaining
sufficient data is still a challenge. This is due, in part, to restrictions on
sharing and aggregating data from different sources to protect patients'
privacy. One possible solution to this is to fine-tune foundation models via
federated learning across multiple participating clients (i.e., hospitals,
clinics, etc.). In this work, we propose a new personalized federated
fine-tuning method that learns orthogonal LoRA adapters to disentangle general
and client-specific knowledge, enabling each client to fully exploit both their
own data and the data of others. Our preliminary results on real-world
federated medical imaging tasks demonstrate that our approach is competitive
against current federated fine-tuning methods.

Result: FlashVSR在单A100 GPU上以约17 FPS处理768x1408视频，性能优于现有方法，速度提升达12倍。

Conclusion: FlashVSR为高效扩散模型VSR提供了实用解决方案，并发布了代码、预训练模型和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently advanced video restoration, but applying them
to real-world video super-resolution (VSR) remains challenging due to high
latency, prohibitive computation, and poor generalization to ultra-high
resolutions. Our goal in this work is to make diffusion-based VSR practical by
achieving efficiency, scalability, and real-time performance. To this end, we
propose FlashVSR, the first diffusion-based one-step streaming framework
towards real-time VSR. FlashVSR runs at approximately 17 FPS for 768x1408
videos on a single A100 GPU by combining three complementary innovations: (i) a
train-friendly three-stage distillation pipeline that enables streaming
super-resolution, (ii) locality-constrained sparse attention that cuts
redundant computation while bridging the train-test resolution gap, and (iii) a
tiny conditional decoder that accelerates reconstruction without sacrificing
quality. To support large-scale training, we also construct VSR-120K, a new
dataset with 120k videos and 180k images. Extensive experiments show that
FlashVSR scales reliably to ultra-high resolutions and achieves
state-of-the-art performance with up to 12x speedup over prior one-step
diffusion VSR models. We will release the code, pretrained models, and dataset
to foster future research in efficient diffusion-based VSR.

Abstract: The scene perception, understanding, and simulation are fundamental
techniques for embodied-AI agents, while existing solutions are still prone to
segmentation deficiency, dynamic objects' interference, sensor data sparsity,
and view-limitation problems. This paper proposes a novel framework, named
SPORTS, for holistic scene understanding via tightly integrating Video Panoptic
Segmentation (VPS), Visual Odometry (VO), and Scene Rendering (SR) tasks into
an iterative and unified perspective. Firstly, VPS designs an adaptive
attention-based geometric fusion mechanism to align cross-frame features via
enrolling the pose, depth, and optical flow modality, which automatically
adjust feature maps for different decoding stages. And a post-matching strategy
is integrated to improve identities tracking. In VO, panoptic segmentation
results from VPS are combined with the optical flow map to improve the
confidence estimation of dynamic objects, which enhances the accuracy of the
camera pose estimation and completeness of the depth map generation via the
learning-based paradigm. Furthermore, the point-based rendering of SR is
beneficial from VO, transforming sparse point clouds into neural fields to
synthesize high-fidelity RGB views and twin panoptic views. Extensive
experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our attention-based
feature fusion outperforms most existing state-of-the-art methods on the
odometry, tracking, segmentation, and novel view synthesis tasks.

Conclusion: VQArt-Bench揭示了当前MLLM的局限性，为未来研究提供了更全面的评估工具。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated significant
capabilities in joint visual and linguistic tasks. However, existing Visual
Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks often fail to evaluate deep semantic
understanding, particularly in complex domains like visual art analysis.
Confined to simple syntactic structures and surface-level attributes, these
questions fail to capture the diversity and depth of human visual inquiry. This
limitation incentivizes models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than
engage in visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce VQArt-Bench, a
new, large-scale VQA benchmark for the cultural heritage domain. This benchmark
is constructed using a novel multi-agent pipeline where specialized agents
collaborate to generate nuanced, validated, and linguistically diverse
questions. The resulting benchmark is structured along relevant visual
understanding dimensions that probe a model's ability to interpret symbolic
meaning, narratives, and complex visual relationships. Our evaluation of 14
state-of-the-art MLLMs on this benchmark reveals significant limitations in
current models, including a surprising weakness in simple counting tasks and a
clear performance gap between proprietary and open-source models.

Motivation: 传统方法独立处理光流和自运动估计，在事件相机中由于缺乏鲁棒的数据关联，导致问题不适定。现有方法通过显式正则化或参数化引入偏差或局部最优。

Conclusion: E-MoFlow通过隐式正则化统一了光流和自运动估计，适用于一般6自由度运动场景。

Abstract: The estimation of optical flow and 6-DoF ego-motion, two fundamental tasks in
3D vision, has typically been addressed independently. For neuromorphic vision
(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes
solving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the
absence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this
ill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an
explicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion
priors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably
introduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which
parametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera
motion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we
propose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical
flow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by
modeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an
implicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal
coherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion
priors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth
estimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency. As a result, our
framework (called E-MoFlow) unifies egomotion and optical flow estimation via
implicit regularization under a fully unsupervised paradigm. Experiments
demonstrate its versatility to general 6-DoF motion scenarios, achieving
state-of-the-art performance among unsupervised methods and competitive even
with supervised approaches.

Conclusion: DL-HMC++展示了数据驱动方法替代硬件运动跟踪的潜力，可推广至临床环境，代码已开源。

Abstract: Head movement poses a significant challenge in brain positron emission
tomography (PET) imaging, resulting in image artifacts and tracer uptake
quantification inaccuracies. Effective head motion estimation and correction
are crucial for precise quantitative image analysis and accurate diagnosis of
neurological disorders. Hardware-based motion tracking (HMT) has limited
applicability in real-world clinical practice. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a deep-learning head motion correction approach with cross-attention
(DL-HMC++) to predict rigid head motion from one-second 3D PET raw data.
DL-HMC++ is trained in a supervised manner by leveraging existing dynamic PET
scans with gold-standard motion measurements from external HMT. We evaluate
DL-HMC++ on two PET scanners (HRRT and mCT) and four radiotracers (18F-FDG,
18F-FPEB, 11C-UCB-J, and 11C-LSN3172176) to demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization of the approach in large cohort PET studies. Quantitative and
qualitative results demonstrate that DL-HMC++ consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art data-driven motion estimation methods, producing motion-free
images with clear delineation of brain structures and reduced motion artifacts
that are indistinguishable from gold-standard HMT. Brain region of interest
standard uptake value analysis exhibits average difference ratios between
DL-HMC++ and gold-standard HMT to be 1.2 plus-minus 0.5% for HRRT and 0.5
plus-minus 0.2% for mCT. DL-HMC++ demonstrates the potential for data-driven
PET head motion correction to remove the burden of HMT, making motion
correction accessible to clinical populations beyond research settings. The

TL;DR: AnyUp是一种无需特定训练的特征上采样方法，适用于任何视觉特征和分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于学习的上采样方法（如DINO或CLIP）需要针对每个特征提取器重新训练的问题，提高上采样质量和泛化能力。

Method: 提出一种推理时特征无关的上采样架构，无需针对特定特征提取器训练。

Result: 实验表明，AnyUp在特征上采样质量上达到新水平，能泛化到不同特征类型，并保持特征语义。

Conclusion: AnyUp高效且易于应用于广泛的下游任务，是一种通用的特征上采样解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce AnyUp, a method for feature upsampling that can be applied to
any vision feature at any resolution, without encoder-specific training.
Existing learning-based upsamplers for features like DINO or CLIP need to be
re-trained for every feature extractor and thus do not generalize to different
feature types at inference time. In this work, we propose an inference-time
feature-agnostic upsampling architecture to alleviate this limitation and
improve upsampling quality. In our experiments, AnyUp sets a new state of the
art for upsampled features, generalizes to different feature types, and
preserves feature semantics while being efficient and easy to apply to a wide
range of downstream tasks.

<details>

Motivation: 尽管在高效的PSNR导向超分辨率方面取得了显著进展，但专注于感知质量的方法仍然相对低效。

Method: 在不超过5M参数和2000 GFLOPs的效率约束下，提出解决方案，并在包含500张4K测试图像的新数据集上评估。

Result: 最佳方法在所有基准数据集上均优于Real-ESRGAN，展示了高效方法在感知领域的潜力。

Conclusion: 本文为高效感知超分辨率建立了现代基准。

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study and benchmark on Efficient
Perceptual Super-Resolution (EPSR). While significant progress has been made in
efficient PSNR-oriented super resolution, approaches focusing on perceptual
quality metrics remain relatively inefficient. Motivated by this gap, we aim to
replicate or improve the perceptual results of Real-ESRGAN while meeting strict
efficiency constraints: a maximum of 5M parameters and 2000 GFLOPs, calculated
for an input size of 960x540 pixels. The proposed solutions were evaluated on a
novel dataset consisting of 500 test images of 4K resolution, each degraded
using multiple degradation types, without providing the original high-quality
counterparts. This design aims to reflect realistic deployment conditions and
serves as a diverse and challenging benchmark. The top-performing approach
manages to outperform Real-ESRGAN across all benchmark datasets, demonstrating
the potential of efficient methods in the perceptual domain. This paper
establishes the modern baselines for efficient perceptual super resolution.

TL;DR: USplat4D通过引入不确定性感知的动态高斯泼溅框架，提升了4D重建的稳定性与质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态3D场景重建在单目输入下存在模糊性，传统方法对所有高斯基元均匀优化，忽略了观测质量差异，导致遮挡下的运动漂移和极端视角下的合成质量下降。

Method: 提出USplat4D框架，通过估计时变高斯不确定性并构建时空图进行不确定性感知优化。

Result: 实验表明，显式建模不确定性显著提升了动态高斯泼溅模型的性能，遮挡下几何更稳定，极端视角合成质量更高。

Conclusion: 不确定性感知是提升动态高斯泼溅模型性能的关键，USplat4D为4D重建提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular input is fundamentally
under-constrained, with ambiguities arising from occlusion and extreme novel
views. While dynamic Gaussian Splatting offers an efficient representation,
vanilla models optimize all Gaussian primitives uniformly, ignoring whether
they are well or poorly observed. This limitation leads to motion drifts under
occlusion and degraded synthesis when extrapolating to unseen views. We argue
that uncertainty matters: Gaussians with recurring observations across views
and time act as reliable anchors to guide motion, whereas those with limited
visibility are treated as less reliable. To this end, we introduce USplat4D, a
novel Uncertainty-aware dynamic Gaussian Splatting framework that propagates
reliable motion cues to enhance 4D reconstruction. Our key insight is to
estimate time-varying per-Gaussian uncertainty and leverages it to construct a
spatio-temporal graph for uncertainty-aware optimization. Experiments on
diverse real and synthetic datasets show that explicitly modeling uncertainty
consistently improves dynamic Gaussian Splatting models, yielding more stable
geometry under occlusion and high-quality synthesis at extreme viewpoints.

TL;DR: Flow Poke Transformer (FPT) 是一种新颖的框架，用于直接预测局部运动的分布，并通过稀疏交互（“pokes”）实现多模态场景运动的可解释表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法通常只能密集采样单一场景动态，而 FPT 旨在提供多模态场景运动的直接可访问表示，并捕捉其依赖关系和不确定性。

Method: FPT 通过稀疏交互（pokes）预测局部运动的分布，并利用 Transformer 架构实现多模态运动建模。

Result: FPT 在密集人脸运动生成和合成数据集等任务中表现优异，甚至超越专用基线方法。

Conclusion: FPT 通过直接预测运动分布，展示了其在多种任务中的灵活性和竞争力，代码和模型已公开。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of a physical scene involves reasoning about the
diverse ways it can potentially change, especially as a result of local
interactions. We present the Flow Poke Transformer (FPT), a novel framework for
directly predicting the distribution of local motion, conditioned on sparse
interactions termed "pokes". Unlike traditional methods that typically only
enable dense sampling of a single realization of scene dynamics, FPT provides
an interpretable directly accessible representation of multi-modal scene
motion, its dependency on physical interactions and the inherent uncertainties
of scene dynamics. We also evaluate our model on several downstream tasks to
enable comparisons with prior methods and highlight the flexibility of our
approach. On dense face motion generation, our generic pre-trained model
surpasses specialized baselines. FPT can be fine-tuned in strongly
out-of-distribution tasks such as synthetic datasets to enable significant
improvements over in-domain methods in articulated object motion estimation.
Additionally, predicting explicit motion distributions directly enables our
method to achieve competitive performance on tasks like moving part
segmentation from pokes which further demonstrates the versatility of our FPT.

TL;DR: SRUM是一种自奖励后训练框架，通过模型的视觉理解模块指导生成模块，无需额外人工标注数据，显著提升多模态模型的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型（UMMs）的视觉理解能力未能有效转化为生成能力，导致模型无法根据文本提示生成准确的图像。

Method: 提出SRUM框架，利用模型的视觉理解模块作为内部评估器，通过全局-局部双奖励系统提供多尺度反馈。

Result: 在T2I-CompBench和T2I-ReasonBench上分别将性能提升至88.37和46.75。

Conclusion: SRUM为UMMs提供了一种自奖励范式，通过理解模块增强生成能力。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in Unified Multimodal Models
(UMMs), which integrate vision-language generation and understanding
capabilities within a single framework. However, a significant gap exists where
a model's strong visual understanding often fails to transfer to its visual
generation. A model might correctly understand an image based on user
instructions, yet be unable to generate a faithful image from text prompts.
This phenomenon directly raises a compelling question: Can a model achieve
self-improvement by using its understanding module to reward its generation
module? To bridge this gap and achieve self-improvement, we introduce SRUM, a
self-rewarding post-training framework that can be directly applied to existing
UMMs of various designs. SRUM creates a feedback loop where the model's own
understanding module acts as an internal ``evaluator'', providing corrective
signals to improve its generation module, without requiring additional
human-labeled data. To ensure this feedback is comprehensive, we designed a
global-local dual reward system. To tackle the inherent structural complexity
of images, this system offers multi-scale guidance: a \textbf{global reward}
ensures the correctness of the overall visual semantics and layout, while a
\textbf{local reward} refines fine-grained, object-level fidelity. SRUM leads
to powerful capabilities and shows strong generalization, boosting performance
on T2I-CompBench from 82.18 to \textbf{88.37} and on T2I-ReasonBench from 43.82
to \textbf{46.75}. Overall, our work establishes a powerful new paradigm for
enabling a UMMs' understanding module to guide and enhance its own generation
via self-rewarding.

Motivation: 传统创建逼真数字人类头像的过程昂贵且耗时，现有方法虽简化了流程，但缺乏多视角信息或显式3D表示，导致视角偏离时质量下降。

Method: 基于预训练的视频扩散模型，生成多视角视频，并将其蒸馏为可实时渲染的4D头像。

Result: 相比之前的方法，MVP4D显著提升了生成头像的真实感、时间一致性和3D一致性。

Conclusion: MVP4D为数字人类头像的创建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital human avatars aim to simulate the dynamic appearance of humans in
virtual environments, enabling immersive experiences across gaming, film,
virtual reality, and more. However, the conventional process for creating and
animating photorealistic human avatars is expensive and time-consuming,
requiring large camera capture rigs and significant manual effort from
professional 3D artists. With the advent of capable image and video generation
models, recent methods enable automatic rendering of realistic animated avatars
from a single casually captured reference image of a target subject. While
these techniques significantly lower barriers to avatar creation and offer
compelling realism, they lack constraints provided by multi-view information or
an explicit 3D representation. So, image quality and realism degrade when
rendered from viewpoints that deviate strongly from the reference image. Here,
we build a video model that generates animatable multi-view videos of digital
humans based on a single reference image and target expressions. Our model,
MVP4D, is based on a state-of-the-art pre-trained video diffusion model and
generates hundreds of frames simultaneously from viewpoints varying by up to
360 degrees around a target subject. We show how to distill the outputs of this
model into a 4D avatar that can be rendered in real-time. Our approach
significantly improves the realism, temporal consistency, and 3D consistency of
generated avatars compared to previous methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有架构依赖独立的图像和文本编码器，限制了跨模态推理和知识转移能力。UniFusion旨在通过统一编码器设计解决这一问题。

Method: 采用LAP机制从冻结VLM中提取多层次信息，并提出VERIFI方法结合VLM的推理能力，增强生成和编辑的灵活性。

Result: LAP在文本-图像对齐和视觉信息转移上优于其他浅层融合架构，编辑任务微调后展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniFusion的统一编码器设计在生成和编辑任务中表现出色，验证了跨模态知识转移的有效性。

Abstract: Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most
existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text.
This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal
reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use
the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train
large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands
substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its
accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model
conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a
unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention
Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level
details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion
generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion
architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of
visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We
propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),
which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens
generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the
alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning
capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In
addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for
generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits
tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image
editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating
the unified encoder design of UniFusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs因图像输入引入的额外视觉令牌导致推理成本增加。

Method: 提出ViCO算法，使用不同压缩比的MLP连接器，训练时最小化KL散度，推理时通过ViR自动选择压缩率。

Result: 实验显示视觉令牌数量减少50%，同时保持感知、推理和OCR能力。

Conclusion: ViCO为高效MLLMs的发展提供了新思路，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) suffer from increased
inference costs due to the additional vision tokens introduced by image inputs.
In this work, we propose Visual Consistency Learning (ViCO), a novel training
algorithm that enables the model to represent images of varying semantic
complexities using different numbers of vision tokens. The key idea behind our
method is to employ multiple MLP connectors, each with a different image
compression ratio, to downsample the vision tokens based on the semantic
complexity of the image. During training, we minimize the KL divergence between
the responses conditioned on different MLP connectors. At inference time, we
introduce an image router, termed Visual Resolution Router (ViR), that
automatically selects the appropriate compression rate for each image patch.
Compared with existing dynamic high-resolution strategies, which adjust the
number of visual tokens based on image resolutions, our method dynamically
adapts the number of visual tokens according to semantic complexity.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can reduce the number of
vision tokens by up to 50% while maintaining the model's perception, reasoning,
and OCR capabilities. We hope this work will contribute to the development of
more efficient MLLMs. The code and models will be released to facilitate future
research.

TL;DR: CuMPerLay是一种可微分的向量化层，将立方多参数持久性（CMP）集成到深度学习流程中，提升图像分析的拓扑特征提取能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CMP在图像拓扑分析中具有强大潜力，但其复杂的多过滤结构和向量化问题阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 提出一种新算法，将CMP分解为可学习的单参数持久性，并通过联合学习双过滤函数实现向量化。

Result: 实验表明，CuMPerLay在医学影像和计算机视觉任务中显著提升了分类和分割性能，尤其在数据有限的情况下。

Conclusion: CuMPerLay为深度学习网络整合全局结构信息提供了新方向。

Abstract: We present CuMPerLay, a novel differentiable vectorization layer that enables
the integration of Cubical Multiparameter Persistence (CMP) into deep learning
pipelines. While CMP presents a natural and powerful way to topologically work
with images, its use is hindered by the complexity of multifiltration
structures as well as the vectorization of CMP. In face of these challenges, we
introduce a new algorithm for vectorizing MP homologies of cubical complexes.
Our CuMPerLay decomposes the CMP into a combination of individual, learnable
single-parameter persistence, where the bifiltration functions are jointly
learned. Thanks to the differentiability, its robust topological feature
vectors can be seamlessly used within state-of-the-art architectures such as
Swin Transformers. We establish theoretical guarantees for the stability of our
vectorization under generalized Wasserstein metrics. Our experiments on
benchmark medical imaging and computer vision datasets show the benefit
CuMPerLay on classification and segmentation performance, particularly in
limited-data scenarios. Overall, CuMPerLay offers a promising direction for
integrating global structural information into deep networks for structured
image analysis.

Result: 在NAVSIM v1/v2和更大规模数据集上显著超越BEV和VLA基线，且数据规模越大性能提升越快。

Conclusion: DriveVLA-W0通过密集自监督信号有效提升VLA模型性能，并展示了数据规模加速效应。

Abstract: Scaling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models on large-scale data offers a
promising path to achieving a more generalized driving intelligence. However,
VLA models are limited by a ``supervision deficit'': the vast model capacity is
supervised by sparse, low-dimensional actions, leaving much of their
representational power underutilized. To remedy this, we propose
\textbf{DriveVLA-W0}, a training paradigm that employs world modeling to
predict future images. This task generates a dense, self-supervised signal that
compels the model to learn the underlying dynamics of the driving environment.
We showcase the paradigm's versatility by instantiating it for two dominant VLA
archetypes: an autoregressive world model for VLAs that use discrete visual
tokens, and a diffusion world model for those operating on continuous visual
features. Building on the rich representations learned from world modeling, we
introduce a lightweight action expert to address the inference latency for
real-time deployment. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM v1/v2 benchmark and a
680x larger in-house dataset demonstrate that DriveVLA-W0 significantly
outperforms BEV and VLA baselines. Crucially, it amplifies the data scaling
law, showing that performance gains accelerate as the training dataset size
increases.

Motivation: 解决现有MLLM在目标检测任务中面临的召回率低、重复预测和坐标不对齐等问题。

Method: 采用特殊令牌表示量化坐标、构建多数据引擎生成高质量数据，以及两阶段训练流程（SFT和GRPO强化学习）。

Result: 在COCO和LVIS等基准测试中表现优异，支持多种语言感知视觉任务。

Conclusion: Rex-Omni为更通用和语言感知的视觉感知系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate
regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although
recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face
challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate
misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a
3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On
benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or
exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot
setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use
special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the
model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate
prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate
high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically
rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage
training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with
GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages
geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous
coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable
behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature
of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent
language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring,
pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and
key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe
that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual
perception systems.

Result: 在多个知识密集型基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: DeepMMSearch-R1为多模态网络搜索提供了有效解决方案，并提出了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in real-world applications require
access to external knowledge sources and must remain responsive to the dynamic
and ever-changing real-world information in order to address
information-seeking and knowledge-intensive user queries. Existing approaches,
such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods, search agents, and search
equipped MLLMs, often suffer from rigid pipelines, excessive search calls, and
poorly constructed search queries, which result in inefficiencies and
suboptimal outcomes. To address these limitations, we present DeepMMSearch-R1,
the first multimodal LLM capable of performing on-demand, multi-turn web
searches and dynamically crafting queries for both image and text search tools.
Specifically, DeepMMSearch-R1 can initiate web searches based on relevant crops
of the input image making the image search more effective, and can iteratively
adapt text search queries based on retrieved information, thereby enabling
self-reflection and self-correction. Our approach relies on a two-stage
training pipeline: a cold start supervised finetuning phase followed by an
online reinforcement learning optimization. For training, we introduce
DeepMMSearchVQA, a novel multimodal VQA dataset created through an automated
pipeline intermixed with real-world information from web search tools. This
dataset contains diverse, multi-hop queries that integrate textual and visual
information, teaching the model when to search, what to search for, which
search tool to use and how to reason over the retrieved information. We conduct
extensive experiments across a range of knowledge-intensive benchmarks to
demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Finally, we analyze the results
and provide insights that are valuable for advancing multimodal web-search.

Motivation: ICU死亡率预测需要高准确性和可解释性，但现有方法多关注人口异质性，忽略了临床过程识别和预后意识。

Result: 实验表明ProtoDoctor在预测准确性上优于现有方法，且其解释更具临床意义和可信度。

Conclusion: ProtoDoctor为ICU死亡率预测提供了高准确性和可解释性的解决方案，适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Intensive Care Unit (ICU) mortality prediction, which estimates a patient's
mortality status at discharge using EHRs collected early in an ICU admission,
is vital in critical care. For this task, predictive accuracy alone is
insufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust
and meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant
attention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should
enable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key
elements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,
demographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional
approaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical
course identification and prognostication awareness. Recent prototype learning
methods address clinical course identification, yet the integration of the
other elements into such frameworks remains underexplored. To address these
gaps, we propose ProtoDoctor, a novel ICU mortality prediction framework that
delivers intrinsic interpretability while integrating all three elements of the
ICU decision-making practices into its reasoning process. Methodologically,
ProtoDoctor features two key innovations: the Prognostic Clinical Course
Identification module and the Demographic Heterogeneity Recognition module. The
former enables the identification of clinical courses via prototype learning
and achieves prognostication awareness using a novel regularization mechanism.

*Ruida Wang,Jiarui Yao,Rui Pan,Shizhe Diao,Tong Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GAR框架通过对抗性训练提升数学问题求解效率，显著提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定问题集，训练效率低且难以解决复杂问题。

Method: 提出GAR框架，联合训练问题生成器和求解器，引入隐式课程学习机制。

Result: 在MiniF2F和ProofNet测试集上，模型性能显著提升。

Conclusion: GAR为可验证环境下的问题生成与求解提供通用RL范式。

Abstract: Solving math problems through verifiable languages such as Lean has
significantly impacted both the mathematics and computer science communities.
Current state-of-the-art models are often trained with expensive online
Reinforcement Learning (RL) or expert iteration. However, these approaches rely
on fixed problem sets, which causes inefficient training and limits the model
to tackle complex problems. To overcome these limitations, we propose GAR:
Generative Adversarial Reinforcement learning, a comprehensive RL training
framework that jointly trains the problem composer and solver in an adversarial
loop. GAR introduces an implicit curriculum learning mechanism, which aligns
task difficulty with the prover's evolving capability. It thereby improves the
training efficiency and enables stronger performance of proving advanced
theorems. Experiments show that with GAR training, Goedel-Prover-V2-8B and
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B achieve an average relative improvement in pass@32 of
4.20% on MiniF2F-Test benchmark, while DeepSeek-Prover-V2's pass@32 on
ProofNet-Test increases from 22.58% to 25.81%. Beyond formal proving, GAR
establishes a general RL paradigm for co-evolution of problem generation and
solving under verifiable environments.

TL;DR: Janus框架结合欧几里得和双曲图神经网络，通过多视图嵌入和对比学习检测节点异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 节点级异常检测（NAD）因结构和特征多样性而具挑战性，Janus旨在通过多几何表示提升检测效果。

Method: 使用欧几里得和双曲空间嵌入节点特征和结构特征，通过多图自编码器和对比学习目标对齐嵌入。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上，Janus优于浅层和深层基线，验证了多几何表示的有效性。

Conclusion: 结合欧几里得和双曲空间表示能有效检测图中复杂异常。

Abstract: Node-level anomaly detection (NAD) is challenging due to diverse structural
patterns and feature distributions. As such, NAD is a critical task with
several applications which range from fraud detection, cybersecurity, to
recommendation systems. We introduce Janus, a framework that jointly leverages
Euclidean and Hyperbolic Graph Neural Networks to capture complementary aspects
of node representations. Each node is described by two views, composed by the
original features and structural features derived from random walks and
degrees, then embedded into Euclidean and Hyperbolic spaces. A multi
Graph-Autoencoder framework, equipped with a contrastive learning objective as
regularization term, aligns the embeddings across the Euclidean and Hyperbolic
spaces, highlighting nodes whose views are difficult to reconcile and are thus
likely anomalous. Experiments on four real-world datasets show that Janus
consistently outperforms shallow and deep baselines, empirically demonstrating
that combining multiple geometric representations provides a robust and
effective approach for identifying subtle and complex anomalies in graphs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种软约束薛定谔桥问题（SCSBP），通过替换硬终端约束为惩罚函数，提高了生成式AI模型的稳定性和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统薛定谔桥问题（SBP）的硬终端约束在高维或数据稀缺情况下会导致不稳定性，SCSBP通过软约束解决了这一问题。

Method: 采用软约束的随机控制方法，结合Doob的h变换、薛定谔势稳定性、Gamma收敛和新的固定点论证。

Result: 证明了最优解的存在性，并显示随着惩罚增加，控制和价值函数以线性速率收敛到经典SBP。

Conclusion: SCSBP不仅提供了软约束桥的定量收敛保证，还为生成建模、微调和迁移学习的鲁棒性提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Generative AI can be framed as the problem of learning a model that maps
simple reference measures into complex data distributions, and it has recently
found a strong connection to the classical theory of the Schr\"odinger bridge
problems (SBPs) due partly to their common nature of interpolating between
prescribed marginals via entropy-regularized stochastic dynamics. However, the
classical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to
instability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or
data-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the
so-called soft-constrained Schr\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the
terminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation
leads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.
  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and
prove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions
converge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on
Doob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\"odinger
potentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an
optimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic
optimal transport problem. These results not only provide the first
quantitative convergence guarantees for soft-constrained bridges but also shed
light on how penalty regularization enables robust generative modeling,
fine-tuning, and transfer learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解训练数据如何影响模型预测行为对改进机器学习系统至关重要，但现有方法在大模型上计算成本高或精度低。

Method: 利用训练和测试数据的中间检查点损失值及检查点本身，无需梯度或逆Hessian计算。

Result: 方法在计算效率和精度上优于现有方法，尤其适用于自影响估计和大语言模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为大规模模型的训练数据分析提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: A critical aspect of analyzing and improving modern machine learning systems
lies in understanding how individual training examples influence a model's
predictive behavior. Estimating this influence enables critical applications,
including data selection and model debugging; in particular, self-influence,
which quantifies the influence of a training point on itself, has found many
uses in data quality assessment and outlier detection. Existing methods for
measuring data influence, however, are often impractical for large models due
to low accuracy or prohibitive computational costs: most approaches either
provide poor approximations or rely on gradients and inverse-Hessian
computations that remain challenging to scale. In this work, we introduce a
highly efficient zeroth-order approximation for estimating the influence of
training data that requires only a fraction of the time and memory footprint of
prior methods. Notably, our method relies solely on loss values of intermediate
checkpoints on the training and test data, along with the checkpoints
themselves, making it broadly applicable even when the loss function of
interest is non-differentiable. Beyond its computational efficiency, our
approach achieves superior accuracy in estimating self-influence and comparable
or improved accuracy in estimating train-test influence for fine-tuned large
language models, enabling scalable and practical analysis of how training data
shapes model behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过微调生成器以减少被过滤的概率，但会导致样本集中在分类器决策边界附近，增加误判。

Method: 提出Boundary Guidance，利用强化学习微调生成器，明确引导生成远离分类器边界。

Result: 在越狱和模糊提示的基准测试中，Boundary Guidance显著提升了输出的安全性和实用性。

Conclusion: Boundary Guidance是一种鲁棒的方法，适用于不同规模的模型和奖励设计。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly paired with safety classifiers that filter
harmful or undesirable outputs. A common strategy is to fine-tune the generator
to reduce the probability of being filtered, but this can be suboptimal: it
often pushes the model toward producing samples near the classifier's decision
boundary, increasing both false positives and false negatives. We propose
Boundary Guidance, a reinforcement learning fine-tuning method that explicitly
steers generation away from the classifier's margin. On a benchmark of
jailbreak and ambiguous prompts, Boundary Guidance improves both the safety and
the utility of outputs, as judged by LLM-as-a-Judge evaluations. Comprehensive
ablations across model scales and reward designs demonstrate the robustness of
our approach.

TL;DR: WaveletDiff是一种基于小波系数的扩散模型，用于生成高质量的时间序列数据，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中高质量时间序列数据稀缺的问题，现有方法难以捕捉多尺度结构。

Method: 利用小波系数训练扩散模型，结合多级分解的专用Transformer和跨级注意力机制，并引入能量守恒约束。

Result: 在六个真实数据集上表现优异，平均性能优于现有方法3倍。

Conclusion: WaveletDiff在多尺度时间序列生成任务中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Time series are ubiquitous in many applications that involve forecasting,
classification and causal inference tasks, such as healthcare, finance, audio
signal processing and climate sciences. Still, large, high-quality time series
datasets remain scarce. Synthetic generation can address this limitation;
however, current models confined either to the time or frequency domains
struggle to reproduce the inherently multi-scaled structure of real-world time
series. We introduce WaveletDiff, a novel framework that trains diffusion
models directly on wavelet coefficients to exploit the inherent
multi-resolution structure of time series data. The model combines dedicated
transformers for each decomposition level with cross-level attention mechanisms
that enable selective information exchange between temporal and frequency
scales through adaptive gating. It also incorporates energy preservation
constraints for individual levels based on Parseval's theorem to preserve
spectral fidelity throughout the diffusion process. Comprehensive tests across
six real-world datasets from energy, finance, and neuroscience domains
demonstrate that WaveletDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
time-domain and frequency-domain generative methods on both short and long time
series across five diverse performance metrics. For example, WaveletDiff
achieves discriminative scores and Context-FID scores that are $3\times$
smaller on average than the second-best baseline across all datasets.

Conclusion: 提供了基于计算预算选择重放比例的实用指南，显著降低训练成本。

Abstract: Adapting language models to new tasks through continued pretraining faces a
fundamental trade-off: models must learn new capabilities while avoiding
catastrophic forgetting of existing knowledge. While prior work has studied
synthetic data generation techniques, the optimal replay ratios for balancing
task performance and knowledge retention under computational constraints remain
poorly understood. We present a comprehensive empirical study investigating the
interplay between replay ratio configuration and computational budget when
adapting language models to new tasks. Using the bAbI reasoning tasks as our
target objective, we apply synthetic data generation and systematically
evaluate different total token budgets and replay ratio configurations. We
analyze their effects on both task mastery and general knowledge retention. Our
experiments reveal an optimal configuration that balances task-specific
performance with general knowledge retention. Based on our findings, we provide
empirically-grounded guidelines for selecting replay ratios based on
computational budget, enabling practitioners to achieve strong task adaptation
with significantly reduced training costs.

Conclusion: 当前模型在多模态讽刺任务上有一定能力，但解释生成需进一步优化。

Abstract: Recent advances in open-source vision-language models (VLMs) offer new
opportunities for understanding complex and subjective multimodal phenomena
such as sarcasm. In this work, we evaluate seven state-of-the-art VLMs - BLIP2,
InstructBLIP, OpenFlamingo, LLaVA, PaliGemma, Gemma3, and Qwen-VL - on their
ability to detect multimodal sarcasm using zero-, one-, and few-shot prompting.
Furthermore, we evaluate the models' capabilities in generating explanations to
sarcastic instances. We evaluate the capabilities of VLMs on three benchmark
sarcasm datasets (Muse, MMSD2.0, and SarcNet). Our primary objectives are
twofold: (1) to quantify each model's performance in detecting sarcastic
image-caption pairs, and (2) to assess their ability to generate human-quality
explanations that highlight the visual-textual incongruities driving sarcasm.
Our results indicate that, while current models achieve moderate success in
binary sarcasm detection, they are still not able to generate high-quality
explanations without task-specific finetuning.

Motivation: 现有研究对参与者行为在PPM中的作用关注有限，但其作为资源驱动过程的关键因素，可能对预测性能指标（如TT）有重要影响。

Method: 使用真实事件日志构建多变量时间序列，包含TT及参与者行为特征（如参与频率、中断行为等），并训练和比较多种模型。

Result: 结果显示，包含参与者行为的模型在RMSE、MAE和R2指标上均优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 建模参与者行为并将其纳入预测模型可显著提升性能指标预测的准确性。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) is a key task in Process Mining that aims
to predict future behavior, outcomes, or performance indicators. Accurate
prediction of the latter is critical for proactive decision-making. Given that
processes are often resource-driven, understanding and incorporating actor
behavior in forecasting is crucial. Although existing research has incorporated
aspects of actor behavior, its role as a time-varying signal in PPM remains
limited. This study investigates whether incorporating actor behavior
information, modeled as time series, can improve the predictive performance of
throughput time (TT) forecasting models. Using real-life event logs, we
construct multivariate time series that include TT alongside actor-centric
features, i.e., actor involvement, the frequency of continuation, interruption,
and handover behaviors, and the duration of these behaviors. We train and
compare several models to study the benefits of adding actor behavior. The
results show that actor-enriched models consistently outperform baseline
models, which only include TT features, in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R2. These
findings demonstrate that modeling actor behavior over time and incorporating
this information into forecasting models enhances performance indicator
predictions.

Motivation: 现有知识图谱嵌入方法通常假设缺失三元组为假，忽略了开放世界假设和显式负陈述的作用。

Method: 采用双模型架构，分别训练正负陈述的嵌入模型，并通过相互评分生成负样本。

Result: 在通用和领域特定知识图谱上，新方法在链接预测和三元组分类任务中优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 显式负知识的整合显著提升了嵌入学习的效果。

Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent information as structured triples and serve as the
backbone for a wide range of applications, including question answering, link
prediction, and recommendation systems. A prominent line of research for
exploring knowledge graphs involves graph embedding methods, where entities and
relations are represented in low-dimensional vector spaces that capture
underlying semantics and structure. However, most existing methods rely on
assumptions such as the Closed World Assumption or Local Closed World
Assumption, treating missing triples as false. This contrasts with the Open
World Assumption underlying many real-world knowledge graphs. Furthermore,
while explicitly stated negative statements can help distinguish between false
and unknown triples, they are rarely included in knowledge graphs and are often
overlooked during embedding training.
  In this work, we introduce a novel approach that integrates explicitly
declared negative statements into the knowledge embedding learning process. Our
approach employs a dual-model architecture, where two embedding models are
trained in parallel, one on positive statements and the other on negative
statements. During training, each model generates negative samples by
corrupting positive samples and selecting the most likely candidates as scored
by the other model. The proposed approach is evaluated on both general-purpose
and domain-specific knowledge graphs, with a focus on link prediction and
triple classification tasks. The extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach improves predictive performance over state-of-the-art embedding
models, demonstrating the value of integrating meaningful negative knowledge
into embedding learning.

Result: CART在对抗性随机游戏中实现了更准确的极小极大值估计和更优的最坏情况回报。

Conclusion: CART为对抗性随机游戏中的鲁棒策略生成提供了有效框架。

Abstract: The Transformer, a highly expressive architecture for sequence modeling, has
recently been adapted to solve sequential decision-making, most notably through
the Decision Transformer (DT), which learns policies by conditioning on desired
returns. Yet, the adversarial robustness of reinforcement learning methods
based on sequence modeling remains largely unexplored. Here we introduce the
Conservative Adversarially Robust Decision Transformer (CART), to our knowledge
the first framework designed to enhance the robustness of DT in adversarial
stochastic games. We formulate the interaction between the protagonist and the
adversary at each stage as a stage game, where the payoff is defined as the
expected maximum value over subsequent states, thereby explicitly incorporating
stochastic state transitions. By conditioning Transformer policies on the NashQ
value derived from these stage games, CART generates policy that are
simultaneously less exploitable (adversarially robust) and conservative to
transition uncertainty. Empirically, CART achieves more accurate minimax value
estimation and consistently attains superior worst-case returns across a range
of adversarial stochastic games.

Conclusion: 自适应低秩策略表示是模型不确定性下鲁棒RL的高效且理论合理的方法。

Abstract: Robust reinforcement learning (Robust RL) seeks to handle epistemic
uncertainty in environment dynamics, but existing approaches often rely on
nested min--max optimization, which is computationally expensive and yields
overly conservative policies. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Rank Representation
(AdaRL)}, a bi-level optimization framework that improves robustness by
aligning policy complexity with the intrinsic dimension of the task. At the
lower level, AdaRL performs policy optimization under fixed-rank constraints
with dynamics sampled from a Wasserstein ball around a centroid model. At the
upper level, it adaptively adjusts the rank to balance the bias--variance
trade-off, projecting policy parameters onto a low-rank manifold. This design
avoids solving adversarial worst-case dynamics while ensuring robustness
without over-parameterization. Empirical results on MuJoCo continuous control
benchmarks demonstrate that AdaRL not only consistently outperforms fixed-rank
baselines (e.g., SAC) and state-of-the-art robust RL methods (e.g., RNAC,
Parseval), but also converges toward the intrinsic rank of the underlying
tasks. These results highlight that adaptive low-rank policy representations
provide an efficient and principled alternative for robust RL under model
uncertainty.

Result: 实验表明，结合两种事件类型的模型效果更优，但现有方法仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁进一步研究统一用户事件建模，并提供了相关资源支持。

Abstract: User event modeling plays a central role in many machine learning
applications, with use cases spanning e-commerce, social media, finance,
cybersecurity, and other domains. User events can be broadly categorized into
personal events, which involve individual actions, and relational events, which
involve interactions between two users. These two types of events are typically
modeled separately, using sequence-based methods for personal events and
graph-based methods for relational events. Despite the need to capture both
event types in real-world systems, prior work has rarely considered them
together. This is often due to the convenient simplification that user behavior
can be adequately represented by a single formalization, either as a sequence
or a graph. To address this gap, there is a need for public datasets and
prediction tasks that explicitly incorporate both personal and relational
events. In this work, we introduce a collection of such datasets, propose a
unified formalization, and empirically show that models benefit from
incorporating both event types. Our results also indicate that current methods
leave a notable room for improvements. We release these resources to support
further research in unified user event modeling and encourage progress in this
direction.

Abstract: Dementia disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal
dementia (FTD) exhibit overlapping electrophysiological signatures in EEG that
challenge accurate diagnosis. Existing EEG-based methods are limited by
full-band frequency analysis that hinders precise differentiation of dementia
subtypes and severity stages. We propose a variational mixture of graph neural
experts (VMoGE) that integrates frequency-specific biomarker identification
with structured variational inference for enhanced dementia diagnosis and
staging. VMoGE employs a multi-granularity transformer to extract multi-scale
temporal patterns across four frequency bands, followed by a variational graph
convolutional encoder using Gaussian Markov Random Field priors. Through
structured variational inference and adaptive gating, VMoGE links neural
specialization to physiologically meaningful EEG frequency bands. Evaluated on
two diverse datasets for both subtype classification and severity staging,
VMoGE achieves superior performance with AUC improvements of +4% to +10% over
state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, VMoGE provides interpretable insights
through expert weights that correlate with clinical indicators and spatial
patterns aligned with neuropathological signatures, facilitating EEG biomarker
discovery for comprehensive dementia diagnosis and monitoring.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内Wi-Fi定位方法需要大量校准且对环境变化敏感，Locaris旨在提供一种无需校准、轻量且通用的解决方案。

Method: Locaris将每个接入点（AP）测量视为一个标记，通过微调LLM直接从原始信号学习设备位置映射。

Result: 实验表明，Locaris在多种Wi-Fi数据上表现优于现有方法，支持少量校准点即可实现亚米级精度。

Conclusion: Locaris为大规模室内定位提供了实用且稳健的解决方案，特别适用于校准不可行的场景。

Abstract: Indoor Wi-Fi positioning remains a challenging problem due to the high
sensitivity of radio signals to environmental dynamics, channel propagation
characteristics, and hardware heterogeneity. Conventional fingerprinting and
model-based approaches typically require labor-intensive calibration and suffer
rapid performance degradation when devices, channel or deployment conditions
change. In this paper, we introduce Locaris, a decoder-only large language
model (LLM) for indoor localization. Locaris treats each access point (AP)
measurement as a token, enabling the ingestion of raw Wi-Fi telemetry without
pre-processing. By fine-tuning its LLM on different Wi-Fi datasets, Locaris
learns a lightweight and generalizable mapping from raw signals directly to
device location. Our experimental study comparing Locaris with state-of-the-art
methods consistently shows that Locaris matches or surpasses existing
techniques for various types of telemetry. Our results demonstrate that compact
LLMs can serve as calibration-free regression models for indoor localization,
offering scalable and robust cross-environment performance in heterogeneous
Wi-Fi deployments. Few-shot adaptation experiments, using only a handful of
calibration points per device, further show that Locaris maintains high
accuracy when applied to previously unseen devices and deployment scenarios.
This yields sub-meter accuracy with just a few hundred samples, robust
performance under missing APs and supports any and all available telemetry. Our
findings highlight the practical viability of Locaris for indoor positioning in
the real-world scenarios, particularly in large-scale deployments where
extensive calibration is infeasible.

Conclusion: 三种重启范式显著提升了非平稳强化学习的性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose three efficient restart paradigms for model-free
non-stationary reinforcement learning (RL). We identify two core issues with
the restart design of Mao et al. (2022)'s RestartQ-UCB algorithm: (1) complete
forgetting, where all the information learned about an environment is lost
after a restart, and (2) scheduled restarts, in which restarts occur only at
predefined timings, regardless of the incompatibility of the policy with the
current environment dynamics. We introduce three approaches, which we call
partial, adaptive, and selective restarts to modify the algorithms RestartQ-UCB
and RANDOMIZEDQ (Wang et al., 2025). We find near-optimal empirical performance
in multiple different environments, decreasing dynamic regret by up to $91$%

TL;DR: 高效图灵可计算性在固定输入/输出精度下意味着存在组合稀疏的DAG表示和相应的神经近似器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨高效计算性与神经网络表示之间的关系，以及如何通过稀疏结构实现高精度近似。

Method: 通过构造有界扇入布尔电路，并用神经网络模拟器替换每个门，构建深度网络。

Result: 证明了存在大小和深度为多项式的深度网络，能够达到目标精度。

Conclusion: 将构造与组合近似率和优化联系起来，展示了稀疏结构在计算和优化中的重要性。

Abstract: We show that \emph{efficient Turing computability} at any fixed input/output
precision implies the existence of \emph{compositionally sparse}
(bounded-fan-in, polynomial-size) DAG representations and of corresponding
neural approximants achieving the target precision. Concretely: if
$f:[0,1]^d\to\R^m$ is computable in time polynomial in the bit-depths, then for
every pair of precisions $(n,m_{\mathrm{out}})$ there exists a bounded-fan-in
Boolean circuit of size and depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ computing the
discretized map; replacing each gate by a constant-size neural emulator yields
a deep network of size/depth $\poly(n+m_{\mathrm{out}})$ that achieves accuracy
$\varepsilon=2^{-m_{\mathrm{out}}}$. We also relate these constructions to
compositional approximation rates

*Quentin Fruytier,Akshay Malhotra,Shahab Hamidi-Rad,Aditya Sant,Aryan Mokhtari,Sujay Sanghavi*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于最大均值差异（MMD）的可编程先验框架，解决了传统VAE中KL散度正则化器无法有效解耦潜在表示的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VAE框架中的KL散度正则化器无法可靠地实现潜在空间的解耦，导致表示学习效果不佳。

Method: 提出了一种基于MMD的可编程先验框架，允许用户显式地塑造潜在空间，并通过新提出的无监督潜在预测分数（LPS）量化解耦效果。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和Tiny ImageNet等复杂数据集上实现了最先进的互独立性，且无需牺牲重构性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为表示工程提供了基础工具，为模型可识别性和因果推理开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations, where distinct factors of variation
are captured by independent latent variables, is a central goal in machine
learning. The dominant approach has been the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
framework, which uses a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalty to encourage
the latent space to match a factorized Gaussian prior. In this work, however,
we provide direct evidence that this KL-based regularizer is an unreliable
mechanism, consistently failing to enforce the target distribution on the
aggregate posterior. We validate this and quantify the resulting entanglement
using our novel, unsupervised Latent Predictability Score (LPS). To address
this failure, we introduce the Programmable Prior Framework, a method built on
the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Our framework allows practitioners to
explicitly sculpt the latent space, achieving state-of-the-art mutual
independence on complex datasets like CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet without the
common reconstruction trade-off. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this
programmability can be used to engineer sophisticated priors that improve
alignment with semantically meaningful features. Ultimately, our work provides
a foundational tool for representation engineering, opening new avenues for
model identifiability and causal reasoning.

Motivation: 现有连续时间生成模型通常采用V形传输，样本独立移动，忽略了共享结构。

Method: 引入Y形生成流，基于具有次线性指数的新型速度驱动传输成本，设计可扩展的神经ODE训练目标。

Result: 在合成、图像和生物数据集上，Y流模型恢复了层次感知结构，优于基线模型，且用更少步骤达到目标。

Conclusion: Y形生成流通过共享路径和分支结构，显著提升了生成模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Modern continuous-time generative models often induce V-shaped transport:
each sample travels independently along nearly straight trajectories from prior
to data, overlooking shared structure. We introduce Y-shaped generative flows,
which move probability mass together along shared pathways before branching to
target-specific endpoints. Our formulation is based on novel velocity-powered
transport cost with a sublinear exponent (between zero and one). this concave
dependence rewards joint and fast mass movement. Practically, we instantiate
the idea in a scalable neural ODE training objective. On synthetic, image, and
biology datasets, Y-flows recover hierarchy-aware structure, improve
distributional metrics over strong flow-based baselines, and reach targets with
fewer integration steps.

TL;DR: MosaicDiff框架通过轨迹感知的结构剪枝，将扩散预训练动态与后训练采样加速对齐，显著提升采样速度且不损失输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的预训练过程存在学习速度不同的阶段，但此前的研究未考虑这一点，导致后训练加速效果不佳。

Method: 提出自适应剪枝机制，根据预训练阶段的学习速度调整剪枝策略：中间快速学习阶段保守剪枝，早期和后期慢速学习阶段激进剪枝。

Result: 在DiT和SDXL上实验表明，MosaicDiff显著超越现有方法，采样速度大幅提升且质量不变。

Conclusion: MosaicDiff为无训练扩散加速提供了新视角，实现了高效且鲁棒的加速效果。

Abstract: Diffusion models are renowned for their generative capabilities, yet their
pretraining processes exhibit distinct phases of learning speed that have been
entirely overlooked in prior post-training acceleration efforts in the
community. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called MosaicDiff that
aligns diffusion pretraining dynamics with post-training sampling acceleration
via trajectory-aware structural pruning. Our approach leverages the observation
that the middle, fast-learning stage of diffusion pretraining requires more
conservative pruning to preserve critical model features, while the early and
later, slow-learning stages benefit from a more aggressive pruning strategy.
This adaptive pruning mechanism is the first to explicitly mirror the inherent
learning speed variations of diffusion pretraining, thereby harmonizing the
model's inner training dynamics with its accelerated sampling process.
Extensive experiments on DiT and SDXL demonstrate that our method achieves
significant speed-ups in sampling without compromising output quality,
outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, also
providing a new viewpoint for more efficient and robust training-free diffusion
acceleration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法缺乏数学框架来建模Transformer层间的状态转换，受物理学启发，作者希望填补这一解释性空白。

Method: 将Transformer的潜在激活转换为希尔伯特空间中的状态向量，隐藏层重新定义为酉算子和哈密顿量，最终概率分布通过玻恩规则计算。

Result: 通过实验验证了QLENS的潜力，展示了其在理解Transformer预测轨迹中的作用。

Conclusion: QLENS为跨领域理解Transformer提供了基础，未来可进一步拓展其应用。

Abstract: In natural language processing, current methods for understanding
Transformers are successful at identifying intermediate predictions during a
model's inference. However, these approaches function as limited diagnostic
checkpoints, lacking a mathematical framework for mechanistically modeling how
each layer facilitates transitions between these evolving states. This
interpretability gap and past successes of interdisciplinary outlooks inspire
us to turn to physics in search of a descriptive mathematical framework for
Transformers. We observe that language models are intrinsically probabilistic,
an attribute that is echoed in the core postulates of quantum mechanics. This
parallel inspires us to translate insights from this discipline to that of
natural language processing. Towards this objective, we propose QLENS a novel
attempt to develop a physics-based perspective on the Transformer generation
process. Under QLENS, a Transformer is studied by converting its latent
activations into a state vector in a Hilbert space derived from the model's
output units. This state subsequently evolves through hidden layers -
reformulated as unitary operators and analogously defined Hamiltonians - during
inference. The model's final probability distribution is obtained by applying
the Born rule to the end state using a specific measurement operator. To
demonstrate QLENS's potential, we conduct a proof-of-concept by probing a toy
Transformer to investigate the influence of individual layers in a model's
prediction trajectory. We present our work as a foundation for cross-domain
insights to be leveraged towards a broader understanding of Transformers.

TL;DR: CW-DPO是一种两阶段优化方法，通过平滑学习动态和冷却权重机制，提升视觉语言模型的稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的偏好微调方法容易因无效负样本导致训练不稳定，CW-DPO旨在通过动态感知优化解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 第一阶段使用低权重平滑监督进行微调；2. 第二阶段通过冷却权重机制调整DPO目标中的负样本梯度。

Result: CW-DPO在稳定性、校准性和胜率上优于SFT和普通DPO，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 平滑学习动态和冷却偏好是提升VLM对齐鲁棒性的有效原则。

Abstract: Preference-based finetuning of vision--language models (VLMs) is brittle:
trivially wrong negatives inject uninformative gradients that destabilize
training. We recast alignment as \textbf{learning-dynamics--aware optimization}
and introduce \textbf{Cooling-Weighted DPO (CW-DPO)}, a two-stage recipe that
explicitly models and exploits the training trajectory. \textbf{Stage 1}
performs supervised finetuning with \textbf{gentle negatives}:
\textbf{low-weight smoothed supervision} that regularizes the base policy and
curbs overconfidence without explicit penalties. \textbf{Stage 2} applies a DPO
objective in which the \textbf{negative term is scaled by a cooling weight}
computed from the model's \textbf{average token log-probability} on each
negative, suppressing uninformative gradients from easy or off-distribution
samples while preserving signal from hard negatives. In practice, we emphasize
\textbf{on-policy negatives} and allow \textbf{mixed negatives} by blending a
controllable fraction of dataset negatives to maintain contrast freshness.
Throughout, we instrument training with $\Delta\!\log p$ probes on positives
and negatives as first-class signals for early stopping, curriculum design, and
failure diagnosis. Across diverse VLM tasks, CW-DPO yields \textbf{more stable
optimization}, \textbf{better calibration}, and \textbf{higher pairwise
win-rates} than SFT-only and vanilla DPO, while \textbf{converging in fewer
steps}. Ablations isolate the \textbf{cooling-weight mechanism} as the primary
driver of these gains and show complementary benefits from mixing on-policy and
dataset negatives. Taken together, our results show that \textbf{smoothing
learning dynamics before cooling preferences} is a simple, general principle
for robust VLM alignment.

Conclusion: 研究为生物启发式学习提供了新思路，并揭示了算法性能与相变之间的强关联。

Abstract: Despite the striking successes of deep neural networks trained with
gradient-based optimization, these methods differ fundamentally from their
biological counterparts. This gap raises key questions about how nature
achieves robust, sample-efficient learning at minimal energy costs and solves
the credit-assignment problem without backpropagation. We take a step toward
bridging contemporary AI and computational neuroscience by studying how neural
dynamics can support fully local, distributed learning that scales to simple
machine-learning benchmarks. Using tools from statistical mechanics, we
identify conditions for the emergence of robust dynamical attractors in random
asymmetric recurrent networks. We derive a closed-form expression for the
number of fixed points as a function of self-coupling strength, and we reveal a
phase transition in their structure: below a critical self-coupling, isolated
fixed points coexist with exponentially many narrow clusters showing the
overlap-gap property; above it, subdominant yet dense and extensive clusters
appear. These fixed points become accessible, including to a simple
asynchronous dynamical rule, after an algorithm-dependent self-coupling
threshold. Building on this analysis, we propose a biologically plausible
algorithm for supervised learning with any binary recurrent network. Inputs are
mapped to fixed points of the dynamics, by relaxing under transient external
stimuli and stabilizing the resulting configurations via local plasticity. We
show that our algorithm can learn an entangled version of MNIST, leverages
depth to develop hierarchical representations and increase hetero-association
capacity, and is applicable to several architectures. Finally, we highlight the
strong connection between algorithm performance and the unveiled phase
transition, and we suggest a cortex-inspired alternative to self-couplings for
its emergence.

Result: 使用精确Hessian矩阵时，神经网络训练会可靠地失败，而拟牛顿法则表现稳定。

Conclusion: 研究质疑了损失函数景观中存在大量局部最小值的传统观点，并揭示了非线性离散化的几何特性。

Abstract: Second-order methods are emerging as promising alternatives to standard
first-order optimizers such as gradient descent and ADAM for training neural
networks. Though the advantages of including curvature information in computing
optimization steps have been celebrated in the scientific machine learning
literature, the only second-order methods that have been studied are
quasi-Newton, meaning that the Hessian matrix of the objective function is
approximated. Though one would expect only to gain from using the true Hessian
in place of its approximation, we show that neural network training reliably
fails when relying on exact curvature information. The failure modes provide
insight both into the geometry of nonlinear discretizations as well as the
distribution of stationary points in the loss landscape, leading us to question
the conventional wisdom that the loss landscape is replete with local minima.

Result: Mamba的测试时样本复杂度优于线性Transformer，接近非线性Transformer，且非线性门控机制是其特征提取的关键。

Conclusion: Mamba的非线性门控机制是其计算高效和高性能的核心，为理论理解提供了新视角。

Abstract: Mamba, a recently proposed linear-time sequence model, has attracted
significant attention for its computational efficiency and strong empirical
performance. However, a rigorous theoretical understanding of its underlying
mechanisms remains limited. In this work, we provide a theoretical analysis of
Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capability by focusing on tasks defined by
low-dimensional nonlinear target functions. Specifically, we study in-context
learning of a single-index model $y \approx g_*(\langle \boldsymbol{\beta},
\boldsymbol{x} \rangle)$, which depends on only a single relevant direction
$\boldsymbol{\beta}$, referred to as feature. We prove that Mamba, pretrained
by gradient-based methods, can achieve efficient ICL via test-time feature
learning, extracting the relevant direction directly from context examples.
Consequently, we establish a test-time sample complexity that improves upon
linear Transformers -- analyzed to behave like kernel methods -- and is
comparable to nonlinear Transformers, which have been shown to surpass the
Correlational Statistical Query (CSQ) lower bound and achieve near
information-theoretically optimal rate in previous works. Our analysis reveals
the crucial role of the nonlinear gating mechanism in Mamba for feature
extraction, highlighting it as the fundamental driver behind Mamba's ability to
achieve both computational efficiency and high performance.

Abstract: Generative classifiers, which leverage conditional generative models for
classification, have recently demonstrated desirable properties such as
robustness to distribution shifts. However, recent progress in this area has
been largely driven by diffusion-based models, whose substantial computational
cost severely limits scalability. This exclusive focus on diffusion-based
methods has also constrained our understanding of generative classifiers. In
this work, we propose a novel generative classifier built on recent advances in
visual autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which offers a new perspective for
studying generative classifiers. To further enhance its performance, we
introduce the Adaptive VAR Classifier$^+$ (A-VARC$^+$), which achieves a
superior trade-off between accuracy and inference speed, thereby significantly
improving practical applicability. Moreover, we show that the VAR-based method
exhibits fundamentally different properties from diffusion-based methods. In
particular, due to its tractable likelihood, the VAR-based classifier enables
visual explainability via token-wise mutual information and demonstrates
inherent resistance to catastrophic forgetting in class-incremental learning
tasks.

Result: 在SleepEDF-20和MASS数据集上，MEASURE优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MEASURE通过减少域相关信息，显著提升了跨域睡眠分期的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning-based automatic sleep staging has significantly advanced in
performance and plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of sleep disorders.
However, those models often struggle to generalize on unseen subjects due to
variability in physiological signals, resulting in degraded performance in
out-of-distribution scenarios. To address this issue, domain generalization
approaches have recently been studied to ensure generalized performance on
unseen domains during training. Among those techniques, contrastive learning
has proven its validity in learning domain-invariant features by aligning
samples of the same class across different domains. Despite its potential, many
existing methods are insufficient to extract adequately domain-invariant
representations, as they do not explicitly address domain characteristics
embedded within the unshared information across samples. In this paper, we
posit that mitigating such domain-relevant attributes-referred to as excess
domain-relevant information-is key to bridging the domain gap. However, the
direct strategy to mitigate the domain-relevant attributes often overfits
features at the high-level information, limiting their ability to leverage the
diverse temporal and spectral information encoded in the multiple feature
levels. To address these limitations, we propose a novel MEASURE (Multi-scalE
minimAl SUfficient Representation lEarning) framework, which effectively
reduces domain-relevant information while preserving essential temporal and
spectral features for sleep stage classification. In our exhaustive experiments
on publicly available sleep staging benchmark datasets, SleepEDF-20 and MASS,
our proposed method consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods. Our

Result: 影响会非单调变化（如符号翻转、峰值），且与语义层次学习直接相关。

Conclusion: 阶段化数据归因能更准确反映模型学习动态，尤其在语言模型中与已知发展阶段一致。

Abstract: Current training data attribution (TDA) methods treat the influence one
sample has on another as static, but neural networks learn in distinct stages
that exhibit changing patterns of influence. In this work, we introduce a
framework for stagewise data attribution grounded in singular learning theory.
We predict that influence can change non-monotonically, including sign flips
and sharp peaks at developmental transitions. We first validate these
predictions analytically and empirically in a toy model, showing that dynamic
shifts in influence directly map to the model's progressive learning of a
semantic hierarchy. Finally, we demonstrate these phenomena at scale in
language models, where token-level influence changes align with known
developmental stages.

Abstract: Graph foundation models represent a transformative paradigm for learning
transferable representations across diverse graph domains. Recent methods
leverage large language models to unify graph and text modalities into a shared
representation space using contrastive learning. However, systematic
evaluations reveal significant performance degradation at structural boundaries
where distinct topological patterns converge, with accuracy losses exceeding 20
percentage points. This issue arises from a key limitation: current methods
assume all graph structures can be encoded within a single Euclidean space. In
reality, tree structures require hyperbolic geometry to preserve hierarchical
branching, while cyclic patterns depend on spherical geometry for closure
properties. At structural boundaries, nodes experience conflicting geometric
constraints that uniform encoding spaces cannot resolve. This raises a crucial
challenge: \textbf{Can alignment frameworks be designed to respect the
intrinsic geometric diversity of graph structures?} We introduce
\textbf{GraphShaper}, a geometry-aware framework that enhances graph encoding
through multi-geometric specialization. Our approach employs expert networks
tailored to different geometric spaces, dynamically computing fusion weights to
adaptively integrate geometric properties based on local structural
characteristics. This adaptive fusion preserves structural integrity before
alignment with text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
GraphShaper achieves 9.47\% accuracy improvements on citation networks and
7.63\% on social networks in zero-shot settings.

Conclusion: 减少嵌入半径能有效保留多尺度结构信息，推动零样本图学习的发展。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs are widely used across domains, offering rich
opportunities for zero-shot learning via graph-text alignment. However,
existing methods struggle with tasks requiring fine-grained pattern
recognition, particularly on heterophilic graphs. Through empirical and
theoretical analysis, we identify an \textbf{over-abstraction problem}: current
approaches operate at excessively large hyperbolic radii, compressing
multi-scale structural information into uniform high-level abstractions. This
abstraction-induced information loss obscures critical local patterns essential
for accurate predictions. By analyzing embeddings in hyperbolic space, we
demonstrate that optimal graph learning requires \textbf{faithful preservation}
of fine-grained structural details, better retained by representations
positioned closer to the origin. To address this, we propose \textbf{H4G}, a
framework that systematically reduces embedding radii using learnable
block-diagonal scaling matrices and M\"obius matrix multiplication. This
approach restores access to fine-grained patterns while maintaining global
receptive ability with minimal computational overhead. Experiments show H4G
achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance with \textbf{12.8\%}
improvement on heterophilic graphs and \textbf{8.4\%} on homophilic graphs,
confirming that radius reduction enables faithful multi-scale representation
for advancing zero-shot graph learning.

Conclusion: 动态稀疏训练与架构改进结合可有效解决深度强化学习中的优化问题。

Abstract: Scaling neural networks has driven breakthrough advances in machine learning,
yet this paradigm fails in deep reinforcement learning (DRL), where larger
models often degrade performance due to unique optimization pathologies such as
plasticity loss. While recent works show that dynamically adapting network
topology during training can mitigate these issues, existing studies have three
critical limitations: (1) applying uniform dynamic training strategies across
all modules despite encoder, critic, and actor following distinct learning
paradigms, (2) focusing evaluation on basic architectures without clarifying
the relative importance and interaction between dynamic training and
architectural improvements, and (3) lacking systematic comparison between
different dynamic approaches including sparse-to-sparse, dense-to-sparse, and
sparse-to-dense. Through comprehensive investigation across modules and
architectures, we reveal that dynamic sparse training strategies provide
module-specific benefits that complement the primary scalability foundation
established by architectural improvements. We finally distill these insights
into Module-Specific Training (MST), a practical framework that further
exploits the benefits of architectural improvements and demonstrates
substantial scalability gains across diverse RL algorithms without algorithmic
modifications.

modeling diverse data such as sequences, images, and graphs. These methods rely
on self-attention, which treats data as an unordered set of elements. This
ignores the neighborhood structure or graph topology of the data and requires
inductive biases--such as position embeddings in sequences and images, or
random walks in graphs--to incorporate topology. However, designing such
task-specific biases requires significant effort and can introduce side effects
that hinder generalization. We introduce Chimera, a unified model that directly
incorporates data topology in a principled way, removing the need for
domain-specific biases. The key idea is that state space models--which
naturally do not require position embeddings--can be generalized to capture any
graph topology. Our experiments show that Chimera achieves strong performance
across language, vision, and graph domains, outperforming BERT on GLUE by 0.7
points, ViT on ImageNet-1k by 2.6%, and all baselines on the Long Range Graph
Benchmark. We further propose algorithmic optimizations to improve Chimera's
efficiency: (1) for Directed Acyclic Graphs, Chimera can be implemented as a
linear-time recurrence; (2) for general graphs, a simple mathematical
relaxation achieves Transformer's quadratic complexity without domain-specific
heuristics. These results validate Chimera's core contribution and support the
idea that data topology is a powerful inductive bias across modalities.

TL;DR: nuGPR是一个新的高斯过程回归框架，通过数值线性代数和并行计算显著降低了训练时间和内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高斯过程回归（GPR）训练计算成本高的问题。

Method: 结合预条件共轭梯度法、数据聚类和低秩近似，使用数值梯度和CUDA并行化。

Result: 训练时间减少2倍，内存消耗减少12倍。

Conclusion: nuGPR在计算效率和性能上优于现有GPU实现的GPR。

Abstract: Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) is an important type of supervised machine
learning model with inherent uncertainty measure in its predictions. We propose
a new framework, nuGPR, to address the well-known challenge of high computation
cost associated with GPR training. Our framework includes several ideas from
numerical linear algebra to reduce the amount of computation in key steps of
GPR, and we combine them to establish an end-to-end training algorithm.
Specifically, we leverage the preconditioned conjugate gradient method to
accelerate the convergence of the linear solves required in GPR. We exploit
clustering in the input data to identify block-diagonal structure of the
covariance matrix and subsequently construct low-rank approximations of the
off-diagonal blocks. These enhancements significantly reduce the time and space
complexity of our computations. In addition, unlike other frameworks that rely
on exact differentiation, we employ numerical gradients to optimize the
hyperparameters of our GPR model, further reducing the training cost by
eliminating the need for backpropagation. Lastly, we leverage the CUDA Toolkit
to efficiently parallelize the training procedure on NVIDIA GPUs. As a result,
nuGPR reduces total training time by up to 2x and peak memory consumption by up
to 12x on various synthetic and real-world datasets when compared to the best
existing GPU-based GPR implementation.

Abstract: Graph few-shot learning has attracted increasing attention due to its ability
to rapidly adapt models to new tasks with only limited labeled nodes. Despite
the remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,
several key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on
predefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to
globally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral
operations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological
structures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume
that the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,
under few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not
sufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to
suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a
novel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum
experts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques. Theoretically, the
proposed approach enhances model generalization by adapting to both local
structural variations and cross-set distribution calibration. Empirically,
GRACE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range
of experimental settings. Our code can be found here.

Motivation: 联邦学习在保护隐私的同时容易受到投毒攻击和偏见传播的影响，研究如何通过恶意行为加剧偏见。

Method: 提出一种故意公平性攻击，通过优化公平性指标（如人口统计平等和均等机会）来增加公平性损失。

Result: 实验表明，攻击能显著增加偏见（高达90%），即使只有一个恶意客户端。

Conclusion: 该攻击对现有防御方案构成威胁，揭示了联邦学习中的新安全挑战。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning technique
that facilitates collaboration among participants across demographics. FL
enables model sharing, while restricting the movement of data. Since FL
provides participants with independence over their training data, it becomes
susceptible to poisoning attacks. Such collaboration also propagates bias among
the participants, even unintentionally, due to different data distribution or
historical bias present in the data. This paper proposes an intentional
fairness attack, where a client maliciously sends a biased model, by increasing
the fairness loss while training, even considering homogeneous data
distribution. The fairness loss is calculated by solving an optimization
problem for fairness metrics such as demographic parity and equalized odds. The
attack is insidious and hard to detect, as it maintains global accuracy even
after increasing the bias. We evaluate our attack against the state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust and fairness-aware aggregation schemes over different
datasets, in various settings. The empirical results demonstrate the attack
efficacy by increasing the bias up to 90\%, even in the presence of a single
malicious client in the FL system.

Result: 方法在多个生存任务基准测试中表现优于其他方法，且时间复杂度和标准主动学习方法BatchBALD相当。

Conclusion: 预算学习在生存数据集中具有潜力，但存在一定限制，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Standard supervised learners attempt to learn a model from a labeled dataset.
Given a small set of labeled instances, and a pool of unlabeled instances, a
budgeted learner can use its given budget to pay to acquire the labels of some
unlabeled instances, which it can then use to produce a model. Here, we explore
budgeted learning in the context of survival datasets, which include (right)
censored instances, where we know only a lower bound on an instance's
time-to-event. Here, that learner can pay to (partially) label a censored
instance -- e.g., to acquire the actual time for an instance [perhaps go from
(3 yr, censored) to (7.2 yr, uncensored)], or other variants [e.g., learn about
one more year, so go from (3 yr, censored) to either (4 yr, censored) or
perhaps (3.2 yr, uncensored)]. This serves as a model of real world data
collection, where follow-up with censored patients does not always lead to
uncensoring, and how much information is given to the learner model during data
collection is a function of the budget and the nature of the data itself. We
provide both experimental and theoretical results for how to apply
state-of-the-art budgeted learning algorithms to survival data and the
respective limitations that exist in doing so. Our approach provides bounds and
time complexity asymptotically equivalent to the standard active learning
method BatchBALD. Moreover, empirical analysis on several survival tasks show
that our model performs better than other potential approaches on several
benchmarks.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLM）在推理中常通过思维链（CoT）进行自我验证，但其对错误的检测能力有限，反思的实际贡献尚不明确。因此，研究旨在通过小型Transformer验证反思的作用。

Method: 提出了一种简约的推理框架，支持小型Transformer的自验证反思，避免自然语言的干扰，并通过理论和实验验证其有效性。

Result: 实验表明，小型Transformer在自验证反思下表现优异，达到LLM级别的性能；强化学习（RL）虽能提升分布内性能，但主要优化浅层统计模式而非验证误差。

Conclusion: 生成式Transformer与判别式验证的结合能有效促进思维链推理，无需依赖规模或自然语言。

Abstract: Advanced large language models (LLMs) frequently reflect in reasoning
chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), where they self-verify the correctness of current
solutions and explore alternatives. However, given recent findings that LLMs
detect limited errors in CoTs, how reflection contributes to empirical
improvements remains unclear. To analyze this issue, in this paper, we present
a minimalistic reasoning framework to support basic self-verifying reflection
for small transformers without natural language, which ensures analytic clarity
and reduces the cost of comprehensive experiments. Theoretically, we prove that
self-verifying reflection guarantees improvements if verification errors are
properly bounded. Experimentally, we show that tiny transformers, with only a
few million parameters, benefit from self-verification in both training and
reflective execution, reaching remarkable LLM-level performance in integer
multiplication and Sudoku. Similar to LLM results, we find that reinforcement
learning (RL) improves in-distribution performance and incentivizes frequent
reflection for tiny transformers, yet RL mainly optimizes shallow statistical
patterns without faithfully reducing verification errors. In conclusion,
integrating generative transformers with discriminative verification inherently
facilitates CoT reasoning, regardless of scaling and natural language.

Conclusion: 结论是元重加权方法的训练动态可分为三个阶段，提出的轻量级方案在性能和稳定性上表现优异。

Abstract: Learning with noisy labels remains challenging because over-parameterized
networks memorize corrupted supervision. Meta-learning-based sample reweighting
mitigates this by using a small clean subset to guide training, yet its
behavior and training dynamics lack theoretical understanding. We provide a
rigorous theoretical analysis of meta-reweighting under label noise and show
that its training trajectory unfolds in three phases: (i) an alignment phase
that amplifies examples consistent with a clean subset and suppresses
conflicting ones; (ii) a filtering phase driving noisy example weights toward
zero until the clean subset loss plateaus; and (iii) a post-filtering phase in
which noise filtration becomes perturbation-sensitive. The mechanism is a
similarity-weighted coupling between training and clean subset signals together
with clean subset training loss contraction; in the post-filtering regime where
the clean-subset loss is sufficiently small, the coupling term vanishes and
meta-reweighting loses discriminatory power. Guided by this analysis, we
propose a lightweight surrogate for meta-reweighting that integrates
mean-centering, row shifting, and label-signed modulation, yielding more stable
performance while avoiding expensive bi-level optimization. Across synthetic
and real noisy-label benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms strong
reweighting/selection baselines.

Result: 在六个真实医疗数据集上表现出最先进的性能，并通过消融实验验证了各组件有效性。

Conclusion: DE3S通过创新技术有效解决了医疗早期时间序列分类中的挑战，提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Early time-series classification (ETSC) in medical applications is crucial
for time-sensitive scenarios such as sepsis prediction in intensive care units
(ICUs), where a large number of deaths are caused by delayed prediction. ETSC
can significantly improve ICU resource utilization efficiency and healthcare
precision. However, it faces conflicting goals of accuracy and earliness, with
existing methods often trading one for the other, struggling to capture subtle
early-stage patterns due to weak initial signals and class imbalance. The key
to solve these challenges is to find shapelets, which are discriminative
subsequences (or shapes) with high interpretability in time-series
classification. This paper proposes Dual-Enhanced Soft-Sparse-Shape Learning
for Medical Early Time-Series Classification (DE3S), which introduces a novel
Dual-Enhanced Soft-Shape Learning framework to figure out shapelets precisely
through three innovations: (1) a comprehensive dual-enhancement strategy
combines traditional temporal augmentation with attention-based global temporal
enhancement for robust representation learning, (2) an attention-score-based
soft shapelet sparsification mechanism dynamically preserves discriminative
patterns while aggregating less important shapelets into representative tokens,
and (3) a dual-path Mixture of Experts Network (MoE) and Inception modules
fusion architecture where MoE performs local learning within shapelets and
multi-scale Inception modules capture global patterns across shapelets. The
framework employs weighted cross-entropy loss for class imbalance handling and
demonstrates robustness on subject-consistency datasets. Extensive experiments
on six real-world medical datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with
ablation studies confirming component efficacy.

Result: 实现一步采样并保留中间状态的可控性，生成性能与现有方法竞争。

Conclusion: 该框架在快速采样和可解释性之间架起桥梁，为可解释图像合成提供新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image
generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative
denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by
learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability
and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that
enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we
introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that
achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories.
Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion
dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear
operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only
eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate
states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the
multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that
disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific
Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We
empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves
competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled
mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through
spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and
interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image
synthesis in generative modeling.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a pivotal framework for modeling
graph-structured data, enabling a wide range of applications from social
network analysis to molecular chemistry. By integrating large language models
(LLMs), text-attributed graphs (TAGs) enhance node representations with rich
textual semantics, significantly boosting the expressive power of graph-based
learning. However, this sophisticated synergy introduces critical
vulnerabilities, as Graph-LLMs are susceptible to adversarial attacks on both
their structural topology and textual attributes. Although specialized attack
methods have been designed for each of these aspects, no work has yet unified
them into a comprehensive approach. In this work, we propose the Interpretable
Multi-Dimensional Graph Attack (IMDGA), a novel human-centric adversarial
attack framework designed to orchestrate multi-level perturbations across both
graph structure and textual features. IMDGA utilizes three tightly integrated
modules to craft attacks that balance interpretability and impact, enabling a
deeper understanding of Graph-LLM vulnerabilities. Through rigorous theoretical
analysis and comprehensive empirical evaluations on diverse datasets and
architectures, IMDGA demonstrates superior interpretability, attack
effectiveness, stealthiness, and robustness compared to existing methods. By
exposing critical weaknesses in TAG representation learning, this work uncovers
a previously underexplored semantic dimension of vulnerability in Graph-LLMs,
offering valuable insights for improving their resilience. Our code and

Conclusion: MoRA通过动态适配保留了LLM的核心知识，同时提升了分子任务的性能。

Abstract: Effectively integrating molecular graph structures with Large Language Models
(LLMs) is a key challenge in drug discovery. Most existing multi-modal
alignment methods typically process these structures by fine-tuning the LLM or
adding a static adapter simultaneously. However, these approaches have two main
limitations: (1) it optimizes a shared parameter space across all molecular
inputs, limiting the model's ability to capture instance-specific structural
features; and (2) fine-tuning the LLM for molecular tasks can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, undermining its general reasoning capabilities. In
this paper, instead of static task-oriented adaptation, we propose an
instance-specific parameter space alignment approach for each molecule
on-the-fly. To this end, we introduce Molecule-aware Low-Rank Adaptation (MoRA)
that produces a unique set of low-rank adaptation weights for each input
molecular graph. These weights are then dynamically injected into a frozen LLM,
allowing the model to adapt its reasoning to the structure of each molecular
input, while preserving the LLM's core knowledge. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that on key molecular tasks, such as chemical reaction prediction
and molecular captioning, MoRA's instance-specific dynamic adaptation
outperforms statically adapted baselines, including a 14.1% relative
improvement in reaction prediction exact match and a 22% reduction in error for
quantum property prediction. The code is available at

Result: 表演性效应在总体设置中增加测试风险，但在过参数化区域可能有益。最优正则化强度与表演性效应强度相关。

Conclusion: 正则化可有效应对表演性效应，最优正则化参数可通过实验验证。

Abstract: In performative learning, the data distribution reacts to the deployed model
- for example, because strategic users adapt their features to game it - which
creates a more complex dynamic than in classical supervised learning. One
should thus not only optimize the model for the current data but also take into
account that the model might steer the distribution in a new direction, without
knowing the exact nature of the potential shift. We explore how regularization
can help cope with performative effects by studying its impact in
high-dimensional ridge regression. We show that, while performative effects
worsen the test risk in the population setting, they can be beneficial in the
over-parameterized regime where the number of features exceeds the number of
samples. We show that the optimal regularization scales with the overall
strength of the performative effect, making it possible to set the
regularization in anticipation of this effect. We illustrate this finding
through empirical evaluations of the optimal regularization parameter on both
synthetic and real-world datasets.

within the RL pipeline, and a technique-oriented taxonomy that situates
implementations across online versus offline learning regimes. We also provide
a comprehensive examination of this progression from single-agent to
multi-agent domains, thereby forming several frameworks for DM-RL integration
and highlighting their practical utility. Furthermore, we outline several
categories of successful applications of diffusion-based RL across diverse
domains, discuss open research issues of current methodologies, and highlight
key directions for future research to advance the field. Finally, we summarize

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖任务标签或额外训练，且固定激活LoRA模块导致参数冗余或不足，影响性能。

Method: HiLoRA利用LoRA的结构特性，定义rank-one components (ROCs)，在序列和token级别自适应选择LoRA和ROCs。

Result: 实验显示HiLoRA在领域泛化中准确率提升高达55%，推理速度与基线相当。

Conclusion: HiLoRA通过自适应路由有效解决了参数冗余问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a widely used technique for
adapting large language models (LLMs) to new domains, due to its modular design
and broad availability on platforms such as HuggingFace. This availability has
motivated efforts to reuse existing LoRAs for domain generalization.
  However, existing methods often rely on explicit task labels or additional
training, which are impractical for deployment. Moreover, they typically
activate a fixed number of entire LoRA modules, leading to parameter redundancy
or insufficiency that degrade performance.
  In this paper, we propose \texttt{HiLoRA}, a training-free framework that
performs adaptive hierarchical routing over LoRA pools. Drawing on structural
properties of LoRA, we define rank-one components (ROCs), in which each rank
parameter is regarded as an independent unit. For a given input sequence,
\texttt{HiLoRA} first adaptively selects a subset of LoRAs and determines their
ROC allocation based on Gaussian likelihoods at the sequence level. At the
token level, it further refines routing by activating only the most informative
ROCs.
  We further provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{HiLoRA} selects the
most relevant LoRAs with high probability.
  Extensive experiments show that \texttt{HiLoRA} achieves substantial
improvements in domain generalization, with accuracy gains of up to {\small
$55\%$} over state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable inference
throughput.

Abstract: Self-improvement has emerged as a state-of-the-art paradigm in Neural
Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), where models iteratively refine their
policies by generating and imitating high-quality solutions. Despite strong
empirical performance, existing methods face key limitations. Training is
computationally expensive, as policy updates require sampling numerous
candidate solutions per instance to extract a single expert trajectory. More
fundamentally, these approaches fail to exploit the structure of combinatorial
problems involving the coordination of multiple agents, such as vehicles in
min-max routing or machines in scheduling. By supervising on single-action
trajectories, they fail to exploit agent-permutation symmetries, where distinct
sequences of actions yield identical solutions, hindering generalization and
the ability to learn coordinated behavior.
  We address these challenges by extending self-improvement to operate over
joint multi-agent actions. Our model architecture predicts complete agent-task
assignments jointly at each decision step. To explicitly leverage symmetries,
we employ a set-prediction loss, which supervises the policy on multiple expert
assignments for any given state. This approach enhances sample efficiency and
the model's ability to learn coordinated behavior. Furthermore, by generating
multi-agent actions in parallel, it drastically accelerates the solution
generation phase of the self-improvement loop. Empirically, we validate our
method on several combinatorial problems, demonstrating consistent improvements
in the quality of the final solution and a reduced generation latency compared
to standard self-improvement.

*Fei Ren,Sifan Wang,Pei-Zhi Zhuang,Hai-Sui Yu,He Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于傅里叶特征的物理信息极限学习机（GFF-PIELM），用于解决高频率和变频率偏微分方程（PDEs）问题，显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PIELM在处理高频率和变频率PDEs时存在困难，需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 通过集成傅里叶特征映射（FFM）到ELM中，并开发新的初始化策略，构建了GFF-PIELM框架。

Result: GFF-PIELM在多个案例中表现出高精度和高效性，且不增加训练时间和架构复杂度。

Conclusion: GFF-PIELM扩展了PIELM的应用范围，并为其他物理信息机器学习框架提供了启发。

Abstract: Conventional physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) often faces
challenges in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) involving
high-frequency and variable-frequency behaviors. To address these challenges,
we propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine
(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier
feature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it
difficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find
an alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we
integrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,
so there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we
assign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM
network to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions. Finally,
we develop an innovative, straightforward initialization method for these
hyperparameters by monitoring the distribution of ELM output weights. GFF-PIELM
not only retains the high accuracy, efficiency, and simplicity of the PIELM
framework but also inherits the ability of FFMs to effectively handle
high-frequency problems. We carry out five case studies with a total of ten
numerical examples to highlight the feasibility and validity of the proposed
GFF-PIELM, involving high frequency, variable frequency, multi-scale behaviour,
irregular boundary and inverse problems. Compared to conventional PIELM, the
GFF-PIELM approach significantly improves predictive accuracy without
additional cost in training time and architecture complexity. Our results
confirm that that PIELM can be extended to solve high-frequency and
variable-frequency PDEs with high accuracy, and our initialization strategy may
further inspire advances in other physics-informed machine learning (PIML)
frameworks.

Motivation: 现有SPI保证主要针对离线、表格化强化学习，研究目标是将其扩展到在线、深度强化学习场景。

Method: 通过限制策略更新到当前策略的邻域，结合局部转移和奖励损失与正则化策略更新，开发了DeepSPI算法。

Result: 在ALE-57基准测试中，DeepSPI表现优于或匹配PPO和DeepMDPs等基线方法，同时保持理论保证。

Conclusion: 研究为在线深度强化学习中的安全策略改进提供了理论框架和实用算法，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Safe policy improvement (SPI) offers theoretical control over policy updates,
yet existing guarantees largely concern offline, tabular reinforcement learning
(RL). We study SPI in general online settings, when combined with world model
and representation learning. We develop a theoretical framework showing that
restricting policy updates to a well-defined neighborhood of the current policy
ensures monotonic improvement and convergence. This analysis links transition
and reward prediction losses to representation quality, yielding online, "deep"
analogues of classical SPI theorems from the offline RL literature. Building on
these results, we introduce DeepSPI, a principled on-policy algorithm that
couples local transition and reward losses with regularised policy updates. On
the ALE-57 benchmark, DeepSPI matches or exceeds strong baselines, including
PPO and DeepMDPs, while retaining theoretical guarantees.

Abstract: Accurate rainfall forecasting, particularly for extreme events, remains a
significant challenge in climatology and the Earth system. This paper presents
novel physics-informed Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) combined with extreme-value
analysis techniques to improve gauge-station rainfall predictions across
Thailand. The model leverages a graph-structured representation of gauge
stations to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns, and it offers
explainability through teleconnections. We preprocess relevant climate indices
that potentially influence regional rainfall. The proposed Graph Attention
Network with Long Short-Term Memory (Attention-LSTM) applies the attention
mechanism using initial edge features derived from simple
orographic-precipitation physics formulation. The embeddings are subsequently
processed by LSTM layers. To address extremes, we perform Peak-Over-Threshold
(POT) mapping using the novel Spatial Season-aware Generalized Pareto
Distribution (GPD) method, which overcomes limitations of traditional
machine-learning models. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
well-established baselines across most regions, including areas prone to
extremes, and remains strongly competitive with the state of the art. Compared
with the operational forecasting system SEAS5, our real-world application
improves extreme-event prediction and offers a practical enhancement to produce
fine-resolution maps that support decision-making in long-term water
management.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际强化学习算法（如奖励塑造、熵正则化或课程学习）使用动态奖励函数，但其理论基础尚不完善。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用单时间尺度actor-critic算法，假设奖励参数随时间变化，并在马尔可夫采样下分析其收敛性。

Result: 证明了在奖励参数缓慢变化时，算法仍能保持$O(1/\sqrt{T})$的收敛速率，与静态奖励情况一致。

Conclusion: 为动态奖励函数的强化学习技术提供了理论支持，并在静态奖励情况下改进了分布不匹配的分析。

Abstract: Many popular practical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms employ evolving
reward functions-through techniques such as reward shaping, entropy
regularization, or curriculum learning-yet their theoretical foundations remain
underdeveloped. This paper provides the first finite-time convergence analysis
of a single-timescale actor-critic algorithm in the presence of an evolving
reward function under Markovian sampling. We consider a setting where the
reward parameters may change at each time step, affecting both policy
optimization and value estimation. Under standard assumptions, we derive
non-asymptotic bounds for both actor and critic errors. Our result shows that
an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate is achievable, matching the best-known rate
for static rewards, provided the reward parameters evolve slowly enough. This
rate is preserved when the reward is updated via a gradient-based rule with
bounded gradient and on the same timescale as the actor and critic, offering a
theoretical foundation for many popular RL techniques. As a secondary
contribution, we introduce a novel analysis of distribution mismatch under
Markovian sampling, improving the best-known rate by a factor of $\log^2T$ in
the static-reward case.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于TSP的令牌重排序策略，结合后处理步骤，解决了加密文本生成的难题，提升了生成文本的连贯性并保护了数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着用户越来越多地使用私有信息与大型语言模型（LLM）交互，安全和加密通信变得至关重要。同态加密（HE）提供了直接对加密数据进行计算的解决方案，但文本生成（特别是下一个令牌预测）的挑战尚未得到充分关注。

Method: 采用基于TSP的令牌重排序策略，并结合后处理步骤以减少近似误差。

Result: 理论分析和实验结果表明，该方法防止了崩溃，提高了生成文本的连贯性，并在整个过程中保护了数据隐私。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了实用且保护隐私的LLM推理的可行性。

Abstract: As users increasingly interact with large language models (LLMs) using
private information, secure and encrypted communication becomes essential.
Homomorphic encryption (HE) provides a principled solution by enabling
computation directly on encrypted data. Although prior work has explored
aspects of running LLMs under HE, the challenge of text generation,
particularly next-token prediction, has received limited attention and remains
a key obstacle to practical encrypted interaction. In this work, we propose a
TSP-based token reordering strategy to address the difficulties of encrypted
text generation, together with a post-processing step that further reduces
approximation error. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate
that our method prevents collapse, improves coherence in generated text, and
preserves data privacy throughout. Overall, our contributions advance the
feasibility of practical and privacy-preserving LLM inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态数据（如图像、表格和文本）中跨模态错误检测的挑战，填补传统方法仅关注单一模态的不足。

Method: 通过基准测试评估了四种数据集和五种基线方法，重点比较了Cleanlab和DataScope在AutoML框架下的表现。

Result: Cleanlab和DataScope在AutoML框架下表现最佳，但现有方法在处理现实世界中的长尾数据时仍有局限性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了跨模态错误检测的重要性，并指出需要进一步改进方法以应对复杂数据场景。

Abstract: Ensuring data quality at scale remains a persistent challenge for large
organizations. Despite recent advances, maintaining accurate and consistent
data is still complex, especially when dealing with multiple data modalities.
Traditional error detection and correction methods tend to focus on a single
modality, typically a table, and often miss cross-modal errors that are common
in domains like e-Commerce and healthcare, where image, tabular, and text data
co-exist. To address this gap, we take an initial step towards cross-modal
error detection in tabular data, by benchmarking several methods. Our
evaluation spans four datasets and five baseline approaches. Among them,
Cleanlab, a label error detection framework, and DataScope, a data valuation
method, perform the best when paired with a strong AutoML framework, achieving
the highest F1 scores. Our findings indicate that current methods remain
limited, particularly when applied to heavy-tailed real-world data, motivating
further research in this area.

Result: 在真实大规模异构图上的实验表明，该方法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能有效提升GNN在异构图上的预训练效果，增强知识迁移能力。

Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have facilitated the
development of graph data mining. However, training GNNs requires sufficient
labeled task-specific data, which is expensive and sometimes unavailable. To be
less dependent on labeled data, recent studies propose to pre-train GNNs in a
self-supervised manner and then apply the pre-trained GNNs to downstream tasks
with limited labeled data. However, most existing methods are designed solely
for homogeneous graphs (real-world graphs are mostly heterogeneous) and do not
consider semantic mismatch (the semantic difference between the original data
and the ideal data containing more transferable semantic information). In this
paper, we propose an effective framework to pre-train GNNs on the large-scale
heterogeneous graph. We first design a structure-aware pre-training task, which
aims to capture structural properties in heterogeneous graphs. Then, we design
a semantic-aware pre-training task to tackle the mismatch. Specifically, we
construct a perturbation subspace composed of semantic neighbors to help deal
with the semantic mismatch. Semantic neighbors make the model focus more on the
general knowledge in the semantic space, which in turn assists the model in
learning knowledge with better transferability. Finally, extensive experiments
are conducted on real-world large-scale heterogeneous graphs to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines. Code

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Cautious Weight Decay (CWD) 是一种优化器无关的改进方法，仅在参数坐标与优化器更新方向一致时应用权重衰减，从而保持原始损失函数并提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准解耦衰减隐式优化了正则化或约束目标，而 CWD 旨在保留原始损失函数，并通过滑动模式行为寻找局部帕累托最优解。

Method: CWD 是一种简单的修改，无需新超参数或额外调整，适用于 AdamW、Lion 和 Muon 等优化器。

Result: 在语言模型预训练和 ImageNet 分类任务中，CWD 在百万到十亿参数规模下显著提升了最终损失和准确率。

Conclusion: CWD 是一种高效且通用的优化方法，能够在不修改目标函数的情况下提升模型性能。

Abstract: We introduce Cautious Weight Decay (CWD), a one-line, optimizer-agnostic
modification that applies weight decay only to parameter coordinates whose
signs align with the optimizer update. Unlike standard decoupled decay, which
implicitly optimizes a regularized or constrained objective, CWD preserves the
original loss and admits a bilevel interpretation: it induces sliding-mode
behavior upon reaching the stationary manifold, allowing it to search for
locally Pareto-optimal stationary points of the unmodified objective. In
practice, CWD is a drop-in change for optimizers such as AdamW, Lion, and Muon,
requiring no new hyperparameters or additional tuning. For language model
pre-training and ImageNet classification, CWD consistently improves final loss
and accuracy at million- to billion-parameter scales.

Motivation: 现有晶体距离函数在评估生成模型时存在四个主要缺陷，无法准确量化化合物间的相似度。

Method: 提出两种连续距离函数，理论上克服了现有方法的局限性。

Result: 实验表明，新方法能揭示传统距离函数忽略的见解，提供更可靠的评估基础。

Conclusion: 新距离函数为无机晶体生成模型的评估和比较提供了更可靠的方法。

Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change,
increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being
developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible
functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions
paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness
and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function.
However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to
quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish
compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity
against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that
is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we
propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and
novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show
that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions,
providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models
for inorganic crystals.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高斯过程的非参数动态定价方法，优于传统强化学习算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态定价方法依赖对需求函数的参数化假设，限制了实际应用。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在收益和鲁棒性上优于现有强化学习算法。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯优化是复杂不确定环境下动态定价的有效工具。

Abstract: Dynamic pricing is the practice of adjusting the selling price of a product
to maximize a firm's revenue by responding to market demand. The literature
typically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the
firm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both
inventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge
lies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is
unknown and must be learned from data. Traditional approaches often assume a
specific parametric form for the demand function, enabling the use of
reinforcement learning (RL) to identify near-optimal pricing strategies.
However, such assumptions may not hold in real-world scenarios, limiting the
applicability of these methods. In this work, we propose a Gaussian Process
(GP) based nonparametric approach to dynamic pricing that avoids restrictive
modeling assumptions. We treat the demand function as a black-box function of
the price and develop pricing algorithms based on Bayesian Optimization (BO) --
a sample-efficient method for optimizing unknown functions. We present BO-based
algorithms tailored for both infinite and finite inventory settings and provide
regret guarantees for both regimes, thereby quantifying the learning efficiency
of our methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our BO-based
methods outperform several state-of-the-art RL algorithms in terms of revenue,
while requiring fewer assumptions and offering greater robustness. This
highlights Bayesian Optimization as a powerful and practical tool for dynamic
pricing in complex, uncertain environments.

TL;DR: 论文重新审视了损失景观几何中平坦最小值与泛化性能的关系，提出尖锐最小值在正则化下可能表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为平坦最小值与更好的泛化性能相关，但近期研究显示这一关系存在例外，需要重新评估尖锐最小值的作用。

Method: 通过从单目标优化到现代图像分类任务的广泛实证研究，分析了正则化（如SAM、权重衰减、数据增强）对尖锐最小值的影响。

Result: 研究发现，正则化下产生的尖锐最小值往往伴随更好的泛化、校准、鲁棒性和功能一致性，而无正则化的基线模型虽收敛到平坦最小值但性能较差。

Conclusion: 函数复杂性而非平坦性主导解的几何特性，尖锐最小值可能反映更合适的归纳偏置，呼吁以函数为中心的损失景观几何重新评估。

Abstract: Flat minima are widely believed to correlate with improved generalisation in
deep neural networks. However, this connection has proven more nuanced in
recent studies, with both theoretical counterexamples and empirical exceptions
emerging in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the role of sharpness in
model performance, proposing that sharpness is better understood as a
function-dependent property rather than a reliable indicator of poor
generalisation. We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective
optimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima
often emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data
augmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better
generalisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency. Across a
range of models and datasets, we find that baselines without regularisation
tend to converge to flatter minima yet often perform worse across all safety
metrics. Our findings demonstrate that function complexity, rather than
flatness alone, governs the geometry of solutions, and that sharper minima can
reflect more appropriate inductive biases (especially under regularisation),
calling for a function-centric reappraisal of loss landscape geometry.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在复杂分布间的转换能力有限，Bridge Matching模型未探索时间相关数据序列的应用，而视频任务需要保持时间连贯性。

Method: 提出TCVBM框架，显式建模序列间依赖关系，将时间相关性融入采样过程。

Result: 在帧插值、图像到视频生成和视频超分辨率任务中，TCVBM在多项定量指标上表现优异。

Conclusion: TCVBM通过引入时间相关性，显著提升了视频任务的生成质量和重建保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel in noise-to-data generation tasks, providing a mapping
from a Gaussian distribution to a more complex data distribution. However they
struggle to model translations between complex distributions, limiting their
effectiveness in data-to-data tasks. While Bridge Matching (BM) models address
this by finding the translation between data distributions, their application
to time-correlated data sequences remains unexplored. This is a critical
limitation for video generation and manipulation tasks, where maintaining
temporal coherence is particularly important. To address this gap, we propose
Time-Correlated Video Bridge Matching (TCVBM), a framework that extends BM to
time-correlated data sequences in the video domain. TCVBM explicitly models
inter-sequence dependencies within the diffusion bridge, directly incorporating
temporal correlations into the sampling process. We compare our approach to
classical methods based on bridge matching and diffusion models for three
video-related tasks: frame interpolation, image-to-video generation, and video
super-resolution. TCVBM achieves superior performance across multiple
quantitative metrics, demonstrating enhanced generation quality and
reconstruction fidelity.

Conclusion: CrossAD通过跨尺度关联和全局上下文建模，实现了最先进的异常检测效果。

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in a wide range of
real-world applications. Given that time series data can exhibit different
patterns at different sampling granularities, multi-scale modeling has proven
beneficial for uncovering latent anomaly patterns that may not be apparent at a
single scale. However, existing methods often model multi-scale information
independently or rely on simple feature fusion strategies, neglecting the
dynamic changes in cross-scale associations that occur during anomalies.
Moreover, most approaches perform multi-scale modeling based on fixed sliding
windows, which limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual
information. In this work, we propose CrossAD, a novel framework for time
series Anomaly Detection that takes Cross-scale associations and Cross-window
modeling into account. We propose a cross-scale reconstruction that
reconstructs fine-grained series from coarser series, explicitly capturing
cross-scale associations. Furthermore, we design a query library and
incorporate global multi-scale context to overcome the limitations imposed by
fixed window sizes. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world
datasets using nine evaluation metrics validate the effectiveness of CrossAD,
demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in anomaly detection.

Motivation: 随着数字经济的发展，组织间的数据协作需求增加，但隐私问题限制了直接数据共享。现有的两方分割学习（VFL）存在计算资源利用率和训练效率低的问题。

Method: 提出PubSub-VFL，结合发布/订阅架构的解耦能力和参数服务器的数据并行性，设计分层异步机制，并通过优化问题选择最优超参数。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，PubSub-VFL在保持准确性的同时，训练速度提升2~7倍，计算资源利用率高达91.07%。

Conclusion: PubSub-VFL是一种高效且隐私安全的VFL解决方案，适用于资源异构环境。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital economy, data collaboration between
organizations has become a well-established business model, driving the growth
of various industries. However, privacy concerns make direct data sharing
impractical. To address this, Two-Party Split Learning (a.k.a. Vertical
Federated Learning (VFL)) has emerged as a promising solution for secure
collaborative learning. Despite its advantages, this architecture still suffers
from low computational resource utilization and training efficiency.
Specifically, its synchronous dependency design increases training latency,
while resource and data heterogeneity among participants further hinder
efficient computation. To overcome these challenges, we propose PubSub-VFL, a
novel VFL paradigm with a Publisher/Subscriber architecture optimized for
two-party collaborative learning with high computational efficiency. PubSub-VFL
leverages the decoupling capabilities of the Pub/Sub architecture and the data
parallelism of the parameter server architecture to design a hierarchical
asynchronous mechanism, reducing training latency and improving system
efficiency. Additionally, to mitigate the training imbalance caused by resource
and data heterogeneity, we formalize an optimization problem based on
participants' system profiles, enabling the selection of optimal
hyperparameters while preserving privacy. We conduct a theoretical analysis to
demonstrate that PubSub-VFL achieves stable convergence and is compatible with
security protocols such as differential privacy. Extensive case studies on five
benchmark datasets further validate its effectiveness, showing that, compared
to state-of-the-art baselines, PubSub-VFL not only accelerates training by $2
\sim 7\times$ without compromising accuracy, but also achieves a computational
resource utilization rate of up to 91.07%.

Result: 实验表明，NAG有效缓解了噪声偏移，显著提升了主流扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: NAG是一种简单有效的方法，能够解决噪声偏移问题，提升扩散模型的生成性能。

Abstract: Existing denoising generative models rely on solving discretized reverse-time
SDEs or ODEs. In this paper, we identify a long-overlooked yet pervasive issue
in this family of models: a misalignment between the pre-defined noise level
and the actual noise level encoded in intermediate states during sampling. We
refer to this misalignment as noise shift. Through empirical analysis, we
demonstrate that noise shift is widespread in modern diffusion models and
exhibits a systematic bias, leading to sub-optimal generation due to both
out-of-distribution generalization and inaccurate denoising updates. To address
this problem, we propose Noise Awareness Guidance (NAG), a simple yet effective
correction method that explicitly steers sampling trajectories to remain
consistent with the pre-defined noise schedule. We further introduce a
classifier-free variant of NAG, which jointly trains a noise-conditional and a
noise-unconditional model via noise-condition dropout, thereby eliminating the
need for external classifiers. Extensive experiments, including ImageNet
generation and various supervised fine-tuning tasks, show that NAG consistently
mitigates noise shift and substantially improves the generation quality of
mainstream diffusion models.

Method: 通过实验测试多种因果发现算法在八种模型假设违反情况下的性能。

Result: 可微分因果发现方法在多数场景下表现稳健，但对尺度变化敏感。

Conclusion: 研究为因果发现算法的评估提供了标准，并推动其在实际中的应用。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to learn causal relationships between variables from
targeted data, making it a fundamental task in machine learning. However,
causal discovery algorithms often rely on unverifiable causal assumptions,
which are usually difficult to satisfy in real-world data, thereby limiting the
broad application of causal discovery in practical scenarios. Inspired by these
considerations, this work extensively benchmarks the empirical performance of
various mainstream causal discovery algorithms, which assume i.i.d. data, under
eight model assumption violations. Our experimental results show that
differentiable causal discovery methods exhibit robustness under the metrics of
Structural Hamming Distance and Structural Intervention Distance of the
inferred graphs in commonly used challenging scenarios, except for scale
variation. We also provide the theoretical explanations for the performance of
differentiable causal discovery methods. Finally, our work aims to
comprehensively benchmark the performance of recent differentiable causal
discovery methods under model assumption violations, and provide the standard
for reasonable evaluation of causal discovery, as well as to further promote
its application in real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: 揭示了自由探索原则的局限性，并提出了新的算法框架。

Abstract: We examine a multi-armed bandit problem with contextual information, where
the objective is to ensure that each arm receives a minimum aggregated reward
across contexts while simultaneously maximizing the total cumulative reward.
This framework captures a broad class of real-world applications where fair
revenue allocation is critical and contextual variation is inherent. The
cross-context aggregation of minimum reward constraints, while enabling better
performance and easier feasibility, introduces significant technical challenges
-- particularly the absence of closed-form optimal allocations typically
available in standard MAB settings. We design and analyze algorithms that
either optimistically prioritize performance or pessimistically enforce
constraint satisfaction. For each algorithm, we derive problem-dependent upper
bounds on both regret and constraint violations. Furthermore, we establish a
lower bound demonstrating that the dependence on the time horizon in our
results is optimal in general and revealing fundamental limitations of the free
exploration principle leveraged in prior work.

Abstract: Cross-silo federated learning (FL) is a promising approach to enable
cross-organization collaboration in machine learning model development without
directly sharing private data. Despite growing organizational interest driven
by data protection regulations such as GDPR and HIPAA, the adoption of
cross-silo FL remains limited in practice. In this paper, we conduct an
interview study to understand the practical challenges associated with
cross-silo FL adoption. With interviews spanning a diverse set of stakeholders
such as user organizations, software providers, and academic researchers, we
uncover various barriers, from concerns about model performance to questions of
incentives and trust between participating organizations. Our study shows that
cross-silo FL faces a set of challenges that have yet to be well-captured by
existing research in the area and are quite distinct from other forms of
federated learning such as cross-device FL. We end with a discussion on future
research directions that can help overcome these challenges.

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏主要作为数据依赖的正则化器，具有负不对称性，应用时需注意安全性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is often considered a compression mechanism when
judged on the resulting student's accuracy and loss, yet its functional impact
is poorly understood. In this work, we quantify the compression capacity of
knowledge distillation and the resulting knowledge transfer from a functional
perspective, decoupling compression from architectural reduction, which
provides an improved understanding of knowledge distillation. We employ
hypothesis testing, controls, and random control distillation to understand
knowledge transfer mechanisms across data modalities. To rigorously test the
breadth and limits of our analyses, we explore multiple distillation variants
and analyse distillation scaling laws across model sizes. Our findings
demonstrate that, while there is statistically significant knowledge transfer
in some modalities and architectures, the extent of this transfer is less
pronounced than anticipated, even under conditions designed to maximise
knowledge sharing. Notably, in cases of significant knowledge transfer, we
identify a consistent and severe asymmetric transfer of negative knowledge to
the student, raising safety concerns in knowledge distillation applications.
Across 12 experimental setups, 9 architectures, and 7 datasets, our findings
show that knowledge distillation functions less as a compression mechanism and
more as a data-dependent regulariser with a negative asymmetric payoff.

Conclusion: 该方法通过解耦变量发现与动力学拟合，简化了粗粒度建模流程，提高了稳定性和效率。

Abstract: High-dimensional recordings of dynamical processes are often characterized by
a much smaller set of effective variables, evolving on low-dimensional
manifolds. Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined
problems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously
fitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these
tasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce
dynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging
the recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs). FIMs are pretrained
models that estimate the infinitesimal generators of dynamical systems (e.g.,
the drift and diffusion of a stochastic differential equation) in zero-shot
mode. By amortizing the inference of the dynamics through a FIM with frozen
weights, and training only the encoder-decoder map, we define a simple,
simulation-consistent loss that stabilizes representation learning. A proof of
concept on a stochastic double-well system with semicircle diffusion, embedded
into synthetic video data, illustrates the potential of this approach for fast
and reusable coarse-graining pipelines.

Motivation: 现有主动特征获取方法通常针对单一任务，缺乏跨任务的可扩展性，且难以处理特征缺失和标签稀缺的问题。

Method: L2M结合了可靠的未见任务不确定性量化和基于不确定性的贪婪特征获取策略，通过序列建模或自回归预训练支持任意缺失情况下的任务。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，L2M表现优于或与任务专用基线相当，尤其在标签稀缺和高缺失情况下。

Conclusion: L2M为跨任务的特征获取提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is a sequential decision-making problem
where the goal is to improve model performance for test instances by adaptively
selecting which features to acquire. In practice, AFA methods often learn from
retrospective data with systematic missingness in the features and limited
task-specific labels. Most prior work addresses acquisition for a single
predetermined task, limiting scalability. To address this limitation, we
formalize the meta-AFA problem, where the goal is to learn acquisition policies
across various tasks. We introduce Learning-to-Measure (L2M), which consists of
i) reliable uncertainty quantification over unseen tasks, and ii) an
uncertainty-guided greedy feature acquisition agent that maximizes conditional
mutual information. We demonstrate a sequence-modeling or autoregressive
pre-training approach that underpins reliable uncertainty quantification for
tasks with arbitrary missingness. L2M operates directly on datasets with
retrospective missingness and performs the meta-AFA task in-context,
eliminating per-task retraining. Across synthetic and real-world tabular
benchmarks, L2M matches or surpasses task-specific baselines, particularly
under scarce labels and high missingness.

Result: 在1024-GPU集群上，Laminar实现了5.48倍的训练吞吐量提升，并缩短了模型收敛时间。

Conclusion: Laminar通过去中心化设计和动态优化，显著提升了RL后训练的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training for Large Language Models (LLMs) is
now scaling to large clusters and running for extended durations to enhance
model reasoning performance. However, the scalability of existing RL frameworks
is limited, as extreme long-tail skewness in RL trajectory generation causes
severe GPU underutilization. Current asynchronous RL systems attempt to
mitigate this, but they rely on global weight synchronization between the actor
and all rollouts, which creates a rigid model update schedule. This global
synchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution
of trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.
Our key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep
through trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each
trajectory independently. We propose Laminar, a scalable and robust RL
post-training system built on a fully decoupled architecture. First, we replace
global updates with a tier of relay workers acting as a distributed parameter
service. This enables asynchronous and fine-grained weight synchronization,
allowing rollouts to pull the latest weight anytime without stalling the
actor's training loop. Second, a dynamic repack mechanism consolidates
long-tail trajectories onto a few dedicated rollouts, maximizing generation
throughput. The fully decoupled design also isolates failures, ensuring
robustness for long-running jobs. Our evaluation on a 1024-GPU cluster shows
that Laminar achieves up to 5.48$\times$ training throughput speedup over
state-of-the-art systems, while reducing model convergence time.

Conclusion: BWD等基于价值感知的分布信号是评估离线强化学习数据集和优化策略的实用工具。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) learns exclusively from static datasets,
without further interaction with the environment. In practice, such datasets
vary widely in quality, often mixing expert, suboptimal, and even random
trajectories. The choice of algorithm therefore depends on dataset fidelity.
Behavior cloning can suffice on high-quality data, whereas mixed- or
low-quality data typically benefits from offline RL methods that stitch useful
behavior across trajectories. Yet in the wild it is difficult to assess dataset
quality a priori because the data's provenance and skill composition are
unknown. We address the problem of estimating offline dataset quality without
training an agent. We study a spectrum of proxies from simple cumulative
rewards to learned value based estimators, and introduce the Bellman
Wasserstein distance (BWD), a value aware optimal transport score that measures
how dissimilar a dataset's behavioral policy is from a random reference policy.
BWD is computed from a behavioral critic and a state conditional OT
formulation, requiring no environment interaction or full policy optimization.
Across D4RL MuJoCo tasks, BWD strongly correlates with an oracle performance
score that aggregates multiple offline RL algorithms, enabling efficient
prediction of how well standard agents will perform on a given dataset. Beyond
prediction, integrating BWD as a regularizer during policy optimization
explicitly pushes the learned policy away from random behavior and improves
returns. These results indicate that value aware, distributional signals such
as BWD are practical tools for triaging offline RL datasets and policy
optimization.

Abstract: Many scientific fields, from medicine to seismology, rely on analyzing
sequences of events over time to understand complex systems. Traditionally,
machine learning models must be built and trained from scratch for each new
dataset, which is a slow and costly process. We introduce a new approach: a
single, powerful model that learns the underlying patterns of event data in
context. We trained this "foundation model" on millions of simulated event
sequences, teaching it a general-purpose understanding of how events can
unfold. As a result, our model can analyze new scientific data instantly,
without retraining, simply by looking at a few examples from the dataset. It
can also be quickly fine-tuned for even higher accuracy. This approach makes
sophisticated event analysis more accessible and accelerates the pace of
scientific discovery.

zero-shot (i.e., in context) from sparse and noisy observations. Trained on
synthetic data, the model utilizes a flexible neural operator for robust ODE
inference, even from corrupted data. We empirically verify that FIM-ODE
provides accurate estimates, on par with a neural state-of-the-art method, and
qualitatively compare the structure of their estimated vector fields.

Result: 在多个公开基准测试中表现优于基线，验证了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SG-XDEAT通过联合建模原始和目标感知视图，并动态过滤噪声，显著提升了表格数据学习效果。

Abstract: We propose SG-XDEAT (Sparsity-Guided Cross Dimensional and Cross-Encoding
Attention with Target Aware Conditioning), a novel framework designed for
supervised learning on tabular data. At its core, SG-XDEAT employs a
dual-stream encoder that decomposes each input feature into two parallel
representations: a raw value stream and a target-conditioned (label-aware)
stream. These dual representations are then propagated through a hierarchical
stack of attention-based modules. SG-XDEAT integrates three key components: (i)
Cross-Dimensional self-attention, which captures intra-view dependencies among
features within each stream; (ii) Cross-Encoding self-attention, which enables
bidirectional interaction between raw and target-aware representations; and
(iii) an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) mechanism, which dynamically
suppresses low-utility tokens by driving their attention weights toward
zero--thereby mitigating the impact of noise. Empirical results on multiple
public benchmarks show consistent gains over strong baselines, confirming that
jointly modeling raw and target-aware views--while adaptively filtering
noise--yields a more robust deep tabular learner.

Abstract: Whisper models have achieved remarkable progress in speech recognition; yet
their large size remains a bottleneck for deployment on resource-constrained

Whisper which address the above problem. Structured sparsity is enforced via
the Sparse Group LASSO penalty as a loss regularizer, to reduce the number of

Abstract: Spectral clustering is a fundamental method for graph partitioning, but its
reliance on eigenvector computation limits scalability to massive graphs.
Classical sparsification methods preserve spectral properties by sampling edges
proportionally to their effective resistances, but require expensive
preprocessing to estimate these resistances. We study whether uniform edge
sampling-a simple, structure-agnostic strategy-can suffice for spectral
clustering. Our main result shows that for graphs admitting a well-separated
$k$-clustering, characterized by a large structure ratio $\Upsilon(k) =
\lambda_{k+1} / \rho_G(k)$, uniform sampling preserves the spectral subspace
used for clustering. Specifically, we prove that uniformly sampling $O(\gamma^2
n \log n / \epsilon^2)$ edges, where $\gamma$ is the Laplacian condition
number, yields a sparsifier whose top $(n-k)$-dimensional eigenspace is
approximately orthogonal to the cluster indicators. This ensures that the
spectral embedding remains faithful, and clustering quality is preserved. Our
analysis introduces new resistance bounds for intra-cluster edges, a
rank-$(n-k)$ effective resistance formulation, and a matrix Chernoff bound
adapted to the dominant eigenspace. These tools allow us to bypass importance
sampling entirely. Conceptually, our result connects recent coreset-based
clustering theory to spectral sparsification, showing that under strong
clusterability, even uniform sampling is structure-aware. This provides the
first provable guarantee that uniform edge sampling suffices for
structure-preserving spectral clustering.

Result: 改进方法显著减少无思维输出长度（从1085降至585）和推理支持标记（从5917降至522）。

Conclusion: 当前混合思维LLMs存在局限性，但通过优化训练方法可增强可控性。

Abstract: Hybrid thinking enables LLMs to switch between reasoning and direct
answering, offering a balance between efficiency and reasoning capability. Yet
our experiments reveal that current hybrid thinking LLMs only achieve partial
mode separation: reasoning behaviors often leak into the no-think mode. To
understand and mitigate this, we analyze the factors influencing
controllability and identify four that matter most: (1) larger data scale, (2)
using think and no-think answers from different questions rather than the same
question, (3) a moderate increase in no-think data number, and (4) a two-phase
strategy that first trains reasoning ability and then applies hybrid think
training. Building on these findings, we propose a practical recipe that,
compared to standard training, can maintain accuracy in both modes while
significantly reducing no-think output length (from $1085$ to $585$ on MATH500)
and occurrences of reasoning-supportive tokens such as ``\texttt{wait}'' (from
$5917$ to $522$ on MATH500). Our findings highlight the limitations of current
hybrid thinking and offer directions for strengthening its controllability.

*Guo Qin,Zhi Chen,Yong Liu,Zhiyuan Shi,Haixuan Liu,Xiangdong Huang,Jianmin Wang,Mingsheng Long*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoRA框架通过结合多模态外生协变量，提升时间序列基础模型的预测性能，同时避免灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）通常仅预训练于单变量时间序列，忽略了多变量间的依赖关系，限制了预测性能。

Method: CoRA框架利用预训练模型作为特征提取器，引入Granger因果嵌入（GCE）评估协变量的因果预测性，并通过零初始化条件注入机制整合外生信息。

Result: 实验表明，CoRA在协变量感知预测任务中优于现有方法，MSE降低31.1%，且兼容多种TSFMs。

Conclusion: CoRA为TSFMs的实际应用提供了有效范式，扩展了协变量的模态范围。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown significant impact through
their model capacity, scalability, and zero-shot generalization. However, due
to the heterogeneity of inter-variate dependencies and the backbone scalability
on large-scale multivariate datasets, most TSFMs are typically pre-trained on
univariate time series. This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial
information from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks. To further
enhance the performance of TSFMs, we propose a general covariate-aware
adaptation (CoRA) framework for TSFMs. It leverages pre-trained backbones of
foundation models while effectively incorporating exogenous covariates from
various modalities, including time series, language, and images, to improve the
quality of predictions. Technically, CoRA maintains the equivalence of
initialization and parameter consistency during adaptation. With preserved
backbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome
embeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative
than raw data. Further, CoRA employs a novel Granger Causality Embedding (GCE)
to automatically evaluate covariates regarding their causal predictability with
respect to the target variate. We incorporate these weighted embeddings with a
zero-initialized condition-injection mechanism, avoiding catastrophic
forgetting of pre-trained foundation models and gradually integrates exogenous
information. Extensive experiments show that CoRA of TSFMs surpasses
state-of-the-art covariate-aware deep forecasters with full or few-shot
training samples, achieving 31.1% MSE reduction on covariate-aware forecasting.
Compared to other adaptation methods, CoRA exhibits strong compatibility with
various advanced TSFMs and extends the scope of covariates to other modalities,
presenting a practical paradigm for the application of TSFMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种稀疏感知分割（SAS）方法，结合局部时间指标引导调整（LTIGA）和图卷积网络（GCN），用于检测城际客车异常停靠，仅需少量标注数据即可实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城际客车异常停靠检测对乘客安全和运营可靠性至关重要，但稀疏的GPS轨迹和有限的标注数据限制了现有方法的有效性。

Method: 1. 使用SAS方法自适应定义轨迹段边界；2. 提出三个领域特定指标捕捉异常停靠行为；3. 开发LTIGA平滑指标；4. 构建时空图并应用标签传播和GCN学习关系模式；5. 通过自训练模块迭代优化预测。

Result: 在真实数据集上，仅用10个标注实例即达到AUC 0.854和AP 0.866，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据稀疏和标注不足的问题，为异常停靠检测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Abnormal stop detection (ASD) in intercity coach transportation is critical
for ensuring passenger safety, operational reliability, and regulatory
compliance. However, two key challenges hinder ASD effectiveness: sparse GPS
trajectories, which obscure short or unauthorized stops, and limited labeled
data, which restricts supervised learning. Existing methods often assume dense
sampling or regular movement patterns, limiting their applicability. To address
data sparsity, we propose a Sparsity-Aware Segmentation (SAS) method that
adaptively defines segment boundaries based on local spatial-temporal density.
Building upon these segments, we introduce three domain-specific indicators to
capture abnormal stop behaviors. To further mitigate the impact of sparsity, we
develop Locally Temporal-Indicator Guided Adjustment (LTIGA), which smooths
these indicators via local similarity graphs. To overcome label scarcity, we
construct a spatial-temporal graph where each segment is a node with
LTIGA-refined features. We apply label propagation to expand weak supervision
across the graph, followed by a GCN to learn relational patterns. A final
self-training module incorporates high-confidence pseudo-labels to iteratively
improve predictions. Experiments on real-world coach data show an AUC of 0.854
and AP of 0.866 using only 10 labeled instances, outperforming prior methods.

Result: 理论证明单调收敛，实验在多种图像重建任务中验证有效性。

Conclusion: DiffEM为损坏数据下的扩散模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative priors for
high-dimensional inverse problems, yet learning them when only corrupted or
noisy observations are available remains challenging. In this work, we propose
a new method for training diffusion models with Expectation-Maximization (EM)
from corrupted data. Our proposed method, DiffEM, utilizes conditional
diffusion models to reconstruct clean data from observations in the E-step, and
then uses the reconstructed data to refine the conditional diffusion model in
the M-step. Theoretically, we provide monotonic convergence guarantees for the
DiffEM iteration, assuming appropriate statistical conditions. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on various image
reconstruction tasks.

of the dual graph and show that it appears to correlate with the decision
boundary -- in the case of binary classification. Additionally, we compute the
homology of the cellular decomposition -- in a regression task -- to draw
similar patterns in behavior between the training loss and polyhedral
cell-count, as the model is trained.

Abstract: Chemical pretrained models, sometimes referred to as foundation models, are
receiving considerable interest for drug discovery applications. The general
chemical knowledge extracted from self-supervised training has the potential to
improve predictions for critical drug discovery endpoints, including on-target
potency and ADMET properties. Multi-task learning has previously been
successfully leveraged to improve predictive models. Here, we show that
enabling multitasking in finetuning of chemical pretrained graph neural network
models such as Kinetic GROVER Multi-Task (KERMT), an enhanced version of the
GROVER model, and Knowledge-guided Pre-training of Graph Transformer (KGPT)
significantly improves performance over non-pretrained graph neural network
models. Surprisingly, we find that the performance improvement from finetuning
KERMT in a multitask manner is most significant at larger data sizes.
Additionally, we publish two multitask ADMET data splits to enable more
accurate benchmarking of multitask deep learning methods for drug property
prediction. Finally, we provide an accelerated implementation of the KERMT
model on GitHub, unlocking large-scale pretraining, finetuning, and inference
in industrial drug discovery workflows.

*Dayin Gou,Sanghyun Byun,Nilesh Malpeddi,Gabrielle De Micheli,Prathamesh Vaste,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CARVQ是一种新型的嵌入层压缩方法，通过结合线性与非线性映射，将LLM的嵌入层压缩至约1.6比特，适用于边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 减少LLM在边缘设备上的内存占用，提升推理速度。

Method: 使用Corrective Adaptor与Residual Vector Quantization组合，无需专用硬件支持低比特存储。

Result: 在多种LLM上测试，CARVQ在保持合理性能的同时显著降低比特数。

Conclusion: CARVQ为LLM在边缘设备上的高效部署提供了重要技术支持。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) typically rely on a large number of parameters
for token embedding, leading to substantial storage requirements and memory
footprints. In particular, LLMs deployed on edge devices are memory-bound, and
reducing the memory footprint by compressing the embedding layer not only frees
up the memory bandwidth but also speeds up inference. To address this, we
introduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group
Residual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear
and non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to
approximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support
lower-bit storage. We test our method on pre-trained LLMs such as LLaMA-3.2-1B,
LLaMA-3.2-3B, LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct, LLaMA-3.1-8B, Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen2.5-Math-7B
and Phi-4, evaluating on common generative, discriminative, math and reasoning
tasks. We show that in most cases, CARVQ can achieve lower average
bitwidth-per-parameter while maintaining reasonable perplexity and accuracy
compared to scalar quantization. Our contributions include a novel compression
technique that is compatible with state-of-the-art transformer quantization
methods and can be seamlessly integrated into any hardware supporting 4-bit
memory to reduce the model's memory footprint in memory-constrained devices.
This work demonstrates a crucial step toward the efficient deployment of LLMs
on edge devices.

Motivation: 探索决策树学习中局部搜索操作（如调整阈值或交换特征）对分类错误的影响，以确定问题的难解性和可解性条件。

Method: 进行参数化复杂性分析，研究特征数量$d$和域大小$D$对问题的影响，提出在$(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$时间内可解的算法。

Result: 问题在一般情况下是NP完全的，但在$d$和$D$较小时是固定参数可解的。

Conclusion: 通过参数化分析揭示了问题的难解性和可解性条件，并提供了算法实现和实证结果。

Abstract: Algorithms for learning decision trees often include heuristic local-search
operations such as (1) adjusting the threshold of a cut or (2) also exchanging
the feature of that cut. We study minimizing the number of classification
errors by performing a fixed number of a single type of these operations.
Although we discover that the corresponding problems are NP-complete in
general, we provide a comprehensive parameterized-complexity analysis with the
aim of determining those properties of the problems that explain the hardness
and those that make the problems tractable. For instance, we show that the
problems remain hard for a small number $d$ of features or small domain size
$D$ but the combination of both yields fixed-parameter tractability. That is,
the problems are solvable in $(D + 1)^{2d} \cdot |I|^{O(1)}$ time, where $|I|$
is the size of the input. We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation of
this algorithm and report on empirical results.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于标准机器学习模型，能准确跟踪实际产量模式。

Conclusion: 分层联邦学习在农业场景中具有优势，尤其适用于异构环境和隐私敏感数据。

Abstract: In this paper, we presents a novel hierarchical federated learning
architecture specifically designed for smart agricultural production systems
and crop yield prediction. Our approach introduces a seasonal subscription
mechanism where farms join crop-specific clusters at the beginning of each
agricultural season. The proposed three-layer architecture consists of
individual smart farms at the client level, crop-specific aggregators at the
middle layer, and a global model aggregator at the top level. Within each crop
cluster, clients collaboratively train specialized models tailored to specific
crop types, which are then aggregated to produce a higher-level global model
that integrates knowledge across multiple crops. This hierarchical design
enables both local specialization for individual crop types and global
generalization across diverse agricultural contexts while preserving data
privacy and reducing communication overhead. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed system, showing that local and crop-layer models
closely follow actual yield patterns with consistent alignment, significantly
outperforming standard machine learning models. The results validate the
advantages of hierarchical federated learning in the agricultural context,
particularly for scenarios involving heterogeneous farming environments and
privacy-sensitive agricultural data.

TL;DR: UNIVERSE方法通过Rashomon集解决变量重要性分析中的未观测特征问题，提供稳健的VI边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VI方法依赖单一模型和观测特征，忽略了未观测变量和Rashomon效应的影响。

Method: 利用Rashomon集（近最优模型集合）估计VI边界，即使存在缺失特征。

Result: 理论证明方法稳健，半合成模拟表现优异，并在信用风险任务中验证实用性。

Conclusion: UNIVERSE为存在未观测变量时的VI分析提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Variable importance (VI) methods are often used for hypothesis generation,
feature selection, and scientific validation. In the standard VI pipeline, an
analyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed
features. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other
variables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted
from observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often
not the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon
known as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing
UNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts
(UNIVERSE). Our approach adapts Rashomon sets - the sets of near-optimal models
in a dataset - to produce bounds on the true VI even with missing features. We
theoretically guarantee the robustness of our approach, show strong performance
on semi-synthetic simulations, and demonstrate its utility in a credit risk
task.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络易受对抗攻击影响，KoALA旨在提供一种无需复杂修改的轻量级解决方案。

Method: 利用KL散度和L0相似性两种度量检测对抗样本，仅需对预训练编码器进行简单微调。

Result: 在ResNet/CIFAR-10和CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet上表现优异，精度和召回率均较高。

Conclusion: KoALA是一种高效、轻量的对抗检测方法，适用于多种模型和数据模态。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are highly susceptible to adversarial attacks, which
pose significant risks to security- and safety-critical applications. We
present KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,
semantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or
adversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an
adversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity
metrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are
specifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL
divergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the
L0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a
formal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a
simple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to
ensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a
lightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data
modalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet
confirm our theoretical claims. When the theorem's conditions are met, KoALA
consistently and effectively detects adversarial examples. On the full test
sets, KoALA achieves a precision of 0.94 and a recall of 0.81 on
ResNet/CIFAR-10, and a precision of 0.66 and a recall of 0.85 on
CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet.

Motivation: 设计一个适用于多个决策者的预测器，以同时最小化多种损失。

Method: 分析了两种现有方法（基于多校准的增强方法和对抗性博弈方法），并提出了一种新的非随机化算法。

Result: 证明多校准比全预测更难，并提出了更高效的直接算法。

Conclusion: 新算法在样本效率和预测器复杂性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing probabilistic predictions that lead
to accurate decisions when employed by downstream users to inform actions. For
a single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to
minimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that
individual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a
variant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor
that simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for
achieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods
that optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain
omniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based
approaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case" loss in an online
fashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly
more difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must
incur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how
these ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an
online-to-batch conversion. This conversion has the downside of returning a
complex, randomized predictor. We improve on this method by designing a more
direct, unrandomized algorithm that exploits structural elements of the set of
proper losses.

Result: mTRL框架为微型机器人技术提供了结构化评估工具，助力其从实验室走向临床。

Conclusion: 微型机器人领域的长期发展需紧密结合医疗需求，mTRL框架是加速其临床转化的关键工具。

Abstract: Untethered mobile milli/microrobots hold transformative potential for
interventional medicine by enabling more precise and entirely non-invasive
diagnosis and therapy. Realizing this promise requires bridging the gap between
groundbreaking laboratory demonstrations and successful clinical integration.
Despite remarkable technical progress over the past two decades, most
millirobots and microrobots remain confined to laboratory proof-of-concept
demonstrations, with limited real-world feasibility. In this Review, we
identify key factors that slow translation from bench to bedside, focusing on
the disconnect between technical innovation and real-world application. We
argue that the long-term impact and sustainability of the field depend on
aligning development with unmet medical needs, ensuring applied feasibility,
and integrating seamlessly into existing clinical workflows, which are
essential pillars for delivering meaningful patient outcomes. To support this
shift, we introduce a strategic milli/microrobot Technology Readiness Level
framework (mTRL), which maps system development from initial conceptualization
to clinical adoption through clearly defined milestones and their associated
stepwise activities. The mTRL model provides a structured gauge of
technological maturity, a common language for cross-disciplinary collaboration
and actionable guidance to accelerate translational development toward new,
safer and more efficient interventions.

Conclusion: 提出的Outram-GSF算法通过连续语义信息提升了全局定位的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: We present a one-shot LiDAR global localization algorithm featuring semantic
disambiguation ability based on a lightweight tri-layered scene graph. While
landmark semantic registration-based methods have shown promising performance
improvements in global localization compared with geometric-only methods,
landmarks can be repetitive and misleading for correspondence establishment. We
propose to mitigate this problem by modeling semantic distributions with
continuous functions learned from a population of Gaussian processes. Compared
with discrete semantic labels, the continuous functions capture finer-grained
geo-semantic information and also provide more detailed metric information for
correspondence establishment. We insert this continuous function as the middle
layer between the object layer and the metric-semantic layer, forming a
tri-layered 3D scene graph, serving as a light-weight yet performant backend
for one-shot localization. We term our global localization pipeline Outram-GSF
(Gaussian semantic field) and conduct a wide range of experiments on publicly
available data sets, validating the superior performance against the current
state-of-the-art.

Result: 硬件试验表明，该方法能在软土和斜坡环境中实现实时导航。

Conclusion: 该框架为可变形地形中的路径规划提供了可扩展的基础，支持确定性、采样或学习驱动的规划。

Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicles operating off-road must plan curvature-feasible
paths while accounting for spatially varying soil strength and slope hazards in
real time. We present a continuous state--cost metric that combines a Bekker
pressure--sinkage model with elevation-derived slope and attitude penalties.
The resulting terrain cost field is analytic, bounded, and monotonic in soil
modulus and slope, ensuring well-posed discretization and stable updates under
sensor noise. This metric is evaluated on a lattice with exact steering
primitives: Dubins and Reeds--Shepp motions for differential drive and
time-parameterized bicycle arcs for Ackermann steering. Global exploration is
performed using Vehicle-Dynamics RRT\(^{*}\), while local repair is managed by
Vehicle-Dynamics D\(^{*}\) Lite, enabling millisecond-scale replanning without
heuristic smoothing. By separating the terrain--vehicle model from the planner,
the framework provides a reusable basis for deterministic, sampling-based, or
learning-driven planning in deformable terrain. Hardware trials on an off-road
platform demonstrate real-time navigation across soft soil and slope
transitions, supporting reliable autonomy in unstructured environments.

Conclusion: 生成的场景可用于优化规划器，提升自动驾驶车辆在不同碰撞场景中的安全性。

Abstract: Evaluating the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires diverse,
safety-critical scenarios, with collisions being especially important yet rare
and unsafe to collect in the real world. Therefore, the community has been
focusing on generating safety-critical scenarios in simulation. However,
controlling attributes such as collision type and time-to-accident (TTA)
remains challenging. We introduce a new task called controllable collision
scenario generation, where the goal is to produce trajectories that realize a
user-specified collision type and TTA, to investigate the feasibility of
automatically generating desired collision scenarios. To support this task, we
present COLLIDE, a large-scale collision scenario dataset constructed by
transforming real-world driving logs into diverse collisions, balanced across
five representative collision types and different TTA intervals. We propose a
framework that predicts Collision Pattern, a compact and interpretable
representation that captures the spatial configuration of the ego and the
adversarial vehicles at impact, before rolling out full adversarial
trajectories. Experiments show that our approach outperforms strong baselines
in both collision rate and controllability. Furthermore, generated scenarios
consistently induce higher planner failure rates, revealing limitations of
existing planners. We demonstrate that these scenarios fine-tune planners for
robustness improvements, contributing to safer AV deployment in different
collision scenarios.

Motivation: 在动态人类环境中，机器人导航需要同时适应多样行为并遵守安全约束。

Method: 开发了一个框架，从正负演示中学习基于密度的奖励，并结合规则目标（如避障和到达目标），通过采样前瞻控制器生成安全且自适应的监督动作，最终蒸馏为紧凑的学生策略。

Result: 在合成和电梯共乘模拟中，成功率和时间效率均优于基线，实际演示验证了部署的实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效平衡了适应性和安全性，适用于动态人类环境中的实时导航。

Abstract: Mobile robot navigation in dynamic human environments requires policies that
balance adaptability to diverse behaviors with compliance to safety
constraints. We hypothesize that integrating data-driven rewards with
rule-based objectives enables navigation policies to achieve a more effective
balance of adaptability and safety. To this end, we develop a framework that
learns a density-based reward from positive and negative demonstrations and
augments it with rule-based objectives for obstacle avoidance and goal
reaching. A sampling-based lookahead controller produces supervisory actions
that are both safe and adaptive, which are subsequently distilled into a
compact student policy suitable for real-time operation with uncertainty
estimates. Experiments in synthetic and elevator co-boarding simulations show
consistent gains in success rate and time efficiency over baselines, and
real-world demonstrations with human participants confirm the practicality of
deployment. A video illustrating this work can be found on our project page

TL;DR: SF是一种无需显式3D输入或深度估计器的对齐策略，通过中间视觉嵌入与3D基础模型的几何表示对齐，提升VLA模型的空间理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型基于2D数据预训练，缺乏准确的空间感知能力，影响其在3D物理世界中的操作。

Method: SF通过中间层对齐视觉嵌入与3D几何表示，隐式增强空间理解能力。

Result: SF在仿真和真实环境中表现优异，超越2D和3D VLA模型，训练速度提升3.8倍，数据效率更高。

Conclusion: SF是一种简单有效的策略，显著提升了VLA模型的空间理解和动作精度。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently shown strong potential in
enabling robots to follow language instructions and execute precise actions.
However, most VLAs are built upon vision-language models pretrained solely on
2D data, which lack accurate spatial awareness and hinder their ability to
operate in the 3D physical world. Existing solutions attempt to incorporate
explicit 3D sensor inputs such as depth maps or point clouds, but these
approaches face challenges due to sensor noise, hardware heterogeneity, and
incomplete depth coverage in existing datasets. Alternative methods that
estimate 3D cues from 2D images also suffer from the limited performance of
depth estimators.We propose Spatial Forcing (SF), a simple yet effective
alignment strategy that implicitly forces VLA models to develop spatial
comprehension capabilities without relying on explicit 3D inputs or depth
estimators. SF aligns intermediate visual embeddings of VLAs with geometric
representations produced by pretrained 3D foundation models. By enforcing
alignment at intermediate layers, SF guides VLAs to encode richer spatial
representations that enhance action precision.Extensive experiments in
simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that SF achieves
state-of-the-art results, surpassing both 2D- and 3D-based VLAs. SF further
accelerates training by up to 3.8x and improves data efficiency across diverse
robotic tasks. Project page is at https://spatial-forcing.github.io/

Result: 仿真和实验显示毫米级精度，减少了壁接触，提高了适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架提高了内窥镜手术的安全性和效率，适用于其他受限和安全关键环境。

Abstract: This paper presents a shape-aware whole-body control framework for
tendon-driven continuum robots with direct application to endoluminal surgical
navigation. Endoluminal procedures, such as bronchoscopy, demand precise and
safe navigation through tortuous, patient-specific anatomy where conventional
tip-only control often leads to wall contact, tissue trauma, or failure to
reach distal targets. To address these challenges, our approach combines a
physics-informed backbone model with residual learning through an Augmented
Neural ODE, enabling accurate shape estimation and efficient Jacobian
computation. A sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) controller
leverages this representation to jointly optimize tip tracking, backbone
conformance, and obstacle avoidance under actuation constraints. A task manager
further enhances adaptability by allowing real-time adjustment of objectives,
such as wall clearance or direct advancement, during tele-operation. Extensive
simulation studies demonstrate millimeter-level accuracy across diverse
scenarios, including trajectory tracking, dynamic obstacle avoidance, and
shape-constrained reaching. Real-robot experiments on a bronchoscopy phantom
validate the framework, showing improved lumen-following accuracy, reduced wall
contacts, and enhanced adaptability compared to joystick-only navigation and
existing baselines. These results highlight the potential of the proposed
framework to increase safety, reliability, and operator efficiency in minimally
invasive endoluminal surgery, with broader applicability to other confined and
safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Recently, biped robot walking technology has been significantly developed,
mainly in the context of a bland walking scheme. To emulate human walking,
robots need to step on the positions they see in unknown spaces accurately. In
this paper, we present PolyMap, a perception-based locomotion planning
framework for humanoid robots to climb stairs. Our core idea is to build a
real-time polygonal staircase plane semantic map, followed by a footstep planar
using these polygonal plane segments. These plane segmentation and visual
odometry are done by multi-sensor fusion(LiDAR, RGB-D camera and IMUs). The
proposed framework is deployed on a NVIDIA Orin, which performs 20-30 Hz
whole-body motion planning output. Both indoor and outdoor real-scene

Result: 在七个机器人运动控制任务中，样本效率平均提升40.1%，任务性能提升7.5%。

Conclusion: 预训练策略有效提升RL性能，为机器人控制任务提供高效初始化方法。

Abstract: The pretraining-finetuning paradigm has facilitated numerous transformative
advancements in artificial intelligence research in recent years. However, in
the domain of reinforcement learning (RL) for robot motion control, individual
skills are often learned from scratch despite the high likelihood that some
generalizable knowledge is shared across all task-specific policies belonging
to a single robot embodiment. This work aims to define a paradigm for
pretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can
subsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic
actor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin
with a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather
diverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive
Inverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained
weights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the
policy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed
method on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant
benefits to this initialization strategy. Our proposed approach on average
improves sample efficiency by 40.1% and task performance by 7.5%, compared to
random initialization. We further present key ablation studies and empirical
analyses that shed light on the mechanisms behind the effectiveness of our
method.

Result: 在2D和3D任务中验证了方法的多样性和可控性，性能媲美SOTA。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了灵活且可控的运动表达，适用于不同交互场景。

Abstract: Legibility of robot motion is critical in human-robot interaction, as it
allows humans to quickly infer a robot's intended goal. Although traditional
trajectory generation methods typically prioritize efficiency, they often fail
to make the robot's intentions clear to humans. Meanwhile, existing approaches
to legible motion usually produce only a single "most legible" trajectory,
overlooking the need to modulate intent expressiveness in different contexts.
In this work, we propose a novel motion generation framework that enables
controllable legibility across the full spectrum, from highly legible to highly
ambiguous motions. We introduce a modeling approach based on an Information
Potential Field to assign continuous legibility scores to trajectories, and
build upon it with a two-stage diffusion framework that first generates paths
at specified legibility levels and then translates them into executable robot
actions. Experiments in both 2D and 3D reaching tasks demonstrate that our
approach produces diverse and controllable motions with varying degrees of
legibility, while achieving performance comparable to SOTA. Code and project

Method: 提出自引导和自适应分块技术。

Result: 在模拟和真实机器人任务中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 新方法有效增强了GBC的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Generative Behavior Cloning (GBC) is a simple yet effective framework for
robot learning, particularly in multi-task settings. Recent GBC methods often
employ diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are
generated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without
replanning. While this approach has demonstrated strong success rates and
generalization, its inherent stochasticity can result in erroneous action
sampling, occasionally leading to unexpected task failures. Moreover, OL
control suffers from delayed responses, which can degrade performance in noisy
or dynamic environments. To address these limitations, we propose two novel
techniques to enhance the consistency and reactivity of diffusion policies: (1)
self-guidance, which improves action fidelity by leveraging past observations
and implicitly promoting future-aware behavior; and (2) adaptive chunking,
which selectively updates action sequences when the benefits of reactivity
outweigh the need for temporal consistency. Extensive experiments show that our
approach substantially improves GBC performance across a wide range of
simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Tactile sensors have a wide range of applications, from utilization in
robotic grippers to human motion measurement. If tactile sensors could be
fabricated and integrated more easily, their applicability would further
expand. In this study, we propose a tactile sensor-M3D-skin-that can be easily
fabricated with high versatility by leveraging the infill patterns of a
multi-material fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer as the sensing
principle. This method employs conductive and non-conductive flexible filaments
to create a hierarchical structure with a specific infill pattern. The flexible
hierarchical structure deforms under pressure, leading to a change in
electrical resistance, enabling the acquisition of tactile information. We
measure the changes in characteristics of the proposed tactile sensor caused by
modifications to the hierarchical structure. Additionally, we demonstrate the
fabrication and use of a multi-tile sensor. Furthermore, as applications, we
implement motion pattern measurement on the sole of a foot, integration with a
robotic hand, and tactile-based robotic operations. Through these experiments,
we validate the effectiveness of the proposed tactile sensor.

Result: 在仿真和现实中验证，能应对不确定的人类运动，减少失败命令和重规划请求。

Conclusion: 该框架在HRC中有效提升了安全性和效率。

Abstract: In a Human-Robot Cooperation (HRC) environment, safety and efficiency are the
two core properties to evaluate robot performance. However, safety mechanisms
usually hinder task efficiency since human intervention will cause backup
motions and goal failures of the robot. Frequent motion replanning will
increase the computational load and the chance of failure. In this paper, we
present a hybrid Reinforcement Learning (RL) planning framework which is
comprised of an interactive motion planner and a RL task planner. The RL task
planner attempts to choose statistically safe and efficient task sequences
based on the feedback from the motion planner, while the motion planner keeps
the task execution process collision-free by detecting human arm motions and
deploying new paths when the previous path is not valid anymore. Intuitively,
the RL agent will learn to avoid dangerous tasks, while the motion planner
ensures that the chosen tasks are safe. The proposed framework is validated on
the cobot in both simulation and the real world, we compare the planner with
hard-coded task motion planning methods. The results show that our planning
framework can 1) react to uncertain human motions at both joint and task
levels; 2) reduce the times of repeating failed goal commands; 3) reduce the
total number of replanning requests.

natively predicts multimodal actions in a single forward pass, enabling
high-precision manipulation at high speed. The framework is built upon two core

efficient. We conduct comprehensive experiments in both simulated environments

The results show that Energy Policy matches or surpasses the performance of

Abstract: Pruning is an essential agricultural practice for orchards. Proper pruning
can promote healthier growth and optimize fruit production throughout the
orchard's lifespan. Robot manipulators have been developed as an automated
solution for this repetitive task, which typically requires seasonal labor with
specialized skills. While previous research has primarily focused on the
challenges of perception, the complexities of manipulation are often
overlooked. These challenges involve planning and control in both joint and
Cartesian spaces to guide the end-effector through intricate, obstructive
branches. Our work addresses the behavior planning challenge for a robotic
pruning system, which entails a multi-level planning problem in environments
with complex collisions. In this paper, we formulate the planning problem for a
high-dimensional robotic arm in a pruning scenario, investigate the system's
intrinsic redundancies, and propose a comprehensive pruning workflow that
integrates perception, modeling, and holistic planning. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that more comprehensive planning methods can significantly enhance
the performance of the robotic manipulator. Finally, we implement the proposed
workflow on a real-world robot. As a result, this work complements previous
efforts on robotic pruning and motivates future research and development in
planning for pruning applications.

Abstract: Tactile perception is crucial for embodied intelligent robots to recognize
objects. Vision-based tactile sensors extract object physical attributes
multidimensionally using high spatial resolution; however, this process
generates abundant redundant information. Furthermore, single-dimensional
extraction, lacking effective fusion, fails to fully characterize object
attributes. These challenges hinder the improvement of recognition accuracy. To
address this issue, this study introduces a two-stream network feature
extraction and fusion perception strategy for vision-based tactile systems.
This strategy employs a distributed approach to extract internal and external
object features. It obtains depth map information through three-dimensional
reconstruction while simultaneously acquiring hardness information by measuring
contact force data. After extracting features with a convolutional neural
network (CNN), weighted fusion is applied to create a more informative and
effective feature representation. In standard tests on objects of varying
shapes and hardness, the force prediction error is 0.06 N (within a 12 N
range). Hardness recognition accuracy reaches 98.0%, and shape recognition
accuracy reaches 93.75%. With fusion algorithms, object recognition accuracy in
actual grasping scenarios exceeds 98.5%. Focused on object physical attributes
perception, this method enhances the artificial tactile system ability to
transition from perception to cognition, enabling its use in embodied
perception applications.

Abstract: In the evolving landscape of high-speed agile quadrotor flight, achieving
precise trajectory tracking at the platform's operational limits is paramount.
Controllers must handle actuator constraints, exhibit robustness to
disturbances, and remain computationally efficient for safety-critical
applications. In this work, we present a novel neural-augmented feedback
controller for agile flight control. The controller addresses individual
limitations of existing state-of-the-art control paradigms and unifies their
strengths. We demonstrate the controller's capabilities, including the accurate
tracking of highly aggressive trajectories that surpass the feasibility of the
actuators. Notably, the controller provides universal stability guarantees,
enhancing its robustness and tracking performance even in exceedingly
disturbance-prone settings. Its nonlinear feedback structure is highly
efficient enabling fast computation at high update rates. Moreover, the
learning process in simulation is both fast and stable, and the controller's
inherent robustness allows direct deployment to real-world platforms without

Conclusion: 控制置信度是自主工具设计中的重要因素，能显著提升工具的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Prehistoric humans invented stone tools for specialized tasks by not just
maximizing the tool's immediate goal-completion accuracy, but also increasing
their confidence in the tool for later use under similar settings. This factor
contributed to the increased robustness of the tool, i.e., the least
performance deviations under environmental uncertainties. However, the current
autonomous tool design frameworks solely rely on performance optimization,
without considering the agent's confidence in tool use for repeated use. Here,
we take a step towards filling this gap by i) defining an optimization
framework for task-conditioned autonomous hand tool design for robots, where
ii) we introduce a neuro-inspired control confidence term into the optimization
routine that helps the agent to design tools with higher robustness. Through
rigorous simulations using a robotic arm, we show that tools designed with
control confidence as the objective function are more robust to environmental
uncertainties during tool use than a pure accuracy-driven objective. We further
show that adding control confidence to the objective function for tool design
provides a balance between the robustness and goal accuracy of the designed
tools under control perturbations. Finally, we show that our CMAES-based
evolutionary optimization strategy for autonomous tool design outperforms other
state-of-the-art optimizers by designing the optimal tool within the fewest
iterations. Code: https://github.com/ajitham123/Tool_design_control_confidence.

Abstract: We present a novel framework for human-robot \emph{logical} interaction that
enables robots to reliably satisfy (infinite horizon) temporal logic tasks
while effectively collaborating with humans who pursue independent and unknown
tasks. The framework combines two key capabilities: (i) \emph{maximal
adaptation} enables the robot to adjust its strategy \emph{online} to exploit
human behavior for cooperation whenever possible, and (ii) \emph{minimal
tunable feedback} enables the robot to request cooperation by the human online
only when necessary to guarantee progress. This balance minimizes human-robot
interference, preserves human autonomy, and ensures persistent robot task
satisfaction even under conflicting human goals. We validate the approach in a
real-world block-manipulation task with a Franka Emika Panda robotic arm and in
the Overcooked-AI benchmark, demonstrating that our method produces rich,
\emph{emergent} cooperative behaviors beyond the reach of existing approaches,
while maintaining strong formal guarantees.

Abstract: Robotics plays a pivotal role in planetary science and exploration, where
autonomous and reliable systems are crucial due to the risks and challenges
inherent to space environments. The establishment of permanent lunar bases
demands robotic platforms capable of navigating and manipulating in the harsh
lunar terrain. While wheeled rovers have been the mainstay for planetary
exploration, their limitations in unstructured and steep terrains motivate the
adoption of legged robots, which offer superior mobility and adaptability. This
paper introduces a constrained reinforcement learning framework designed for
autonomous quadrupedal mobile manipulators operating in lunar environments. The
proposed framework integrates whole-body locomotion and manipulation
capabilities while explicitly addressing critical safety constraints, including
collision avoidance, dynamic stability, and power efficiency, in order to
ensure robust performance under lunar-specific conditions, such as reduced
gravity and irregular terrain. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in achieving precise 6D task-space end-effector pose tracking,
achieving an average positional accuracy of 4 cm and orientation accuracy of
8.1 degrees. The system consistently respects both soft and hard constraints,
exhibiting adaptive behaviors optimized for lunar gravity conditions. This work
effectively bridges adaptive learning with essential mission-critical safety
requirements, paving the way for advanced autonomous robotic explorers for
future lunar missions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型在适应新任务时效率低下，强化学习（RL）过程通常效率不高，阻碍快速任务掌握。

Method: 采用双路径架构：1）Failure-Driven Reflective RL路径，通过失败分析自动合成密集奖励函数；2）Success-Driven Quality-Guided SFT路径，通过模仿高质量成功轨迹确保任务目标对齐。

Result: 在复杂操作任务中，框架实现了更快的收敛速度和更高的最终成功率。

Conclusion: 该框架为创建能够高效可靠适应新环境的自我改进代理提供了稳健解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models represent a major leap
towards general-purpose robots, yet efficiently adapting them to novel,
specific tasks in-situ remains a significant hurdle. While reinforcement
learning (RL) is a promising avenue for such adaptation, the process often
suffers from low efficiency, hindering rapid task mastery. We introduce
Reflective Self-Adaptation, a framework for rapid, autonomous task adaptation
without human intervention. Our framework establishes a self-improving loop
where the agent learns from its own experience to enhance both strategy and
execution.
  The core of our framework is a dual-pathway architecture that addresses the
full adaptation lifecycle. First, a Failure-Driven Reflective RL pathway
enables rapid learning by using the VLM's causal reasoning to automatically
synthesize a targeted, dense reward function from failure analysis. This
provides a focused learning signal that significantly accelerates policy
exploration. However, optimizing such proxy rewards introduces a potential risk
of "reward hacking," where the agent masters the reward function but fails the
actual task. To counteract this, our second pathway, Success-Driven
Quality-Guided SFT, grounds the policy in holistic success. It identifies and
selectively imitates high-quality successful trajectories, ensuring the agent
remains aligned with the ultimate task goal. This pathway is strengthened by a
conditional curriculum mechanism to aid initial exploration.
  We conduct experiments in challenging manipulation tasks. The results
demonstrate that our framework achieves faster convergence and higher final
success rates compared to representative baselines. Our work presents a robust
solution for creating self-improving agents that can efficiently and reliably
adapt to new environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合MPC和RL的并行残差架构，通过扭矩控制级混合输出，兼具模型控制的解释性和RL的适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MPC具有解释性和可调性，但受限于模型失配和实时计算；RL能产生鲁棒行为，但缺乏解释性且需要大量奖励工程。

Method: 开发了并行处理的全身MPC框架，残差策略学习对MPC输出进行针对性修正。

Result: 相比单独MPC或RL，方法样本效率更高，收敛更快，适应更广的速度指令和地形。

Conclusion: 结合MPC和RL的方法在性能和适应性上优于单一方法，支持零样本适应新步态和地形。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) provides interpretable, tunable locomotion
controllers grounded in physical models, but its robustness depends on frequent
replanning and is limited by model mismatch and real-time computational
constraints. Reinforcement Learning (RL), by contrast, can produce highly
robust behaviors through stochastic training but often lacks interpretability,
suffers from out-of-distribution failures, and requires intensive reward
engineering. This work presents a GPU-parallelized residual architecture that
tightly integrates MPC and RL by blending their outputs at the torque-control
level. We develop a kinodynamic whole-body MPC formulation evaluated across
thousands of agents in parallel at 100 Hz for RL training. The residual policy
learns to make targeted corrections to the MPC outputs, combining the
interpretability and constraint handling of model-based control with the
adaptability of RL. The model-based control prior acts as a strong bias,
initializing and guiding the policy towards desirable behavior with a simple
set of rewards. Compared to standalone MPC or end-to-end RL, our approach
achieves higher sample efficiency, converges to greater asymptotic rewards,
expands the range of trackable velocity commands, and enables zero-shot
adaptation to unseen gaits and uneven terrain.

Conclusion: T(R,O) Grasp具有成为灵巧抓取基础模型的潜力，支持闭环灵巧操作。

Abstract: Dexterous grasping remains a central challenge in robotics due to the
complexity of its high-dimensional state and action space. We introduce T(R,O)
Grasp, a diffusion-based framework that efficiently generates accurate and
diverse grasps across multiple robotic hands. At its core is the T(R,O) Graph,
a unified representation that models spatial transformations between robotic
hands and objects while encoding their geometric properties. A graph diffusion
model, coupled with an efficient inverse kinematics solver, supports both
unconditioned and conditioned grasp synthesis. Extensive experiments on a
diverse set of dexterous hands show that T(R,O) Grasp achieves average success
rate of 94.83%, inference speed of 0.21s, and throughput of 41 grasps per
second on an NVIDIA A100 40GB GPU, substantially outperforming existing
baselines. In addition, our approach is robust and generalizable across
embodiments while significantly reducing memory consumption. More importantly,
the high inference speed enables closed-loop dexterous manipulation,
underscoring the potential of T(R,O) Grasp to scale into a foundation model for
dexterous grasping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂城市环境中，双向多智能体交互的推理需要估计驾驶操作的潜在成本，而现有方法的成本函数设计复杂且难以覆盖广泛场景。

Method: HYPE通过整合学习提案模型的多模态轨迹提案作为启发式先验，结合蒙特卡洛树搜索进行优化，并引入自我条件占用预测模型。

Result: 在nuPlan和DeepUrban基准测试中，HYPE实现了最先进的性能，尤其在安全性和适应性方面表现突出。

Conclusion: HYPE通过简化成本函数设计和引入场景感知推理，有效提升了复杂城市环境中的规划性能。

Abstract: Safe and interpretable motion planning in complex urban environments needs to
reason about bidirectional multi-agent interactions. This reasoning requires to
estimate the costs of potential ego driving maneuvers. Many existing planners
generate initial trajectories with sampling-based methods and refine them by
optimizing on learned predictions of future environment states, which requires
a cost function that encodes the desired vehicle behavior. Designing such a
cost function can be very challenging, especially if a wide range of complex
urban scenarios has to be considered. We propose HYPE: HYbrid Planning with Ego
proposal-conditioned predictions, a planner that integrates multimodal
trajectory proposals from a learned proposal model as heuristic priors into a
Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) refinement. To model bidirectional interactions,
we introduce an ego-conditioned occupancy prediction model, enabling
consistent, scene-aware reasoning. Our design significantly simplifies cost
function design in refinement by considering proposal-driven guidance,
requiring only minimalistic grid-based cost terms. Evaluations on large-scale
real-world benchmarks nuPlan and DeepUrban show that HYPE effectively achieves
state-of-the-art performance, especially in safety and adaptability.
