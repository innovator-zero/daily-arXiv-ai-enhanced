For this task, predictive accuracy alone is\ninsufficient; interpretability is equally essential for building clinical trust\nand meeting regulatory standards, a topic that has attracted significant\nattention in information system research. Accordingly, an ideal solution should\nenable intrinsic interpretability and align its reasoning with three key\nelements of the ICU decision-making practices: clinical course identification,\ndemographic heterogeneity, and prognostication awareness. However, conventional\napproaches largely focus on demographic heterogeneity, overlooking clinical\ncourse identification and prognostication awareness.

However, the\nclassical SBP enforces hard terminal constraints, which often leads to\ninstability in practical implementations, especially in high-dimensional or\ndata-scarce regimes. To address this challenge, we follow the idea of the\nso-called soft-constrained Schr\\\"odinger bridge problem (SCSBP), in which the\nterminal constraint is replaced by a general penalty function. This relaxation\nleads to a more flexible stochastic control formulation of McKean-Vlasov type.\n  We establish the existence of optimal solutions for all penalty levels and\nprove that, as the penalty grows, both the controls and value functions\nconverge to those of the classical SBP at a linear rate. Our analysis builds on\nDoob's h-transform representations, the stability results of Schr\\\"odinger\npotentials, Gamma-convergence, and a novel fixed-point argument that couples an\noptimization problem over the space of measures with an auxiliary entropic\noptimal transport problem.

This paper proposes a novel model, PanoTPS-Net, to estimate\nroom layout from a single panorama image. Leveraging a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork (CNN) and incorporating a Thin Plate Spline (TPS) spatial\ntransformation, the architecture of PanoTPS-Net is divided into two stages:\nFirst, a convolutional neural network extracts the high-level features from the\ninput images, allowing the network to learn the spatial parameters of the TPS\ntransformation. Second, the TPS spatial transformation layer is generated to\nwarp a reference layout to the required layout based on the predicted\nparameters. This unique combination empowers the model to properly predict room\nlayouts while also generalizing effectively to both cuboid and non-cuboid\nlayouts. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets and comparisons\nwith state-of-the-art methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod. The results underscore the model's accuracy in room layout estimation\nand emphasize the compatibility between the TPS transformation and panorama\nimages.

This work aims to define a paradigm for\npretraining neural network models that encapsulate such knowledge and can\nsubsequently serve as a basis for warm-starting the RL process in classic\nactor-critic algorithms, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). We begin\nwith a task-agnostic exploration-based data collection algorithm to gather\ndiverse, dynamic transition data, which is then used to train a Proprioceptive\nInverse Dynamics Model (PIDM) through supervised learning. The pretrained\nweights are loaded into both the actor and critic networks to warm-start the\npolicy optimization of actual tasks. We systematically validated our proposed\nmethod on seven distinct robot motion control tasks, showing significant\nbenefits to this initialization strategy.

Recent GBC methods often\nemploy diffusion policies with open-loop (OL) control, where actions are\ngenerated via a diffusion process and executed in multi-step chunks without\nreplanning.

However, it remains an extremely challenging task due to three\nconundrums: increasingly large model complexity, non-smooth representation\nshift during incremental learning and inconsistency between stage-wise\nsub-problem optimization and global inference. In this work, we propose the\nDiscriminative Representation Learning (DRL) framework to specifically address\nthese challenges. To conduct incremental learning effectively and yet\nefficiently, the DRL's network, called Incremental Parallel Adapter (IPA)\nnetwork, is built upon a PTM and increasingly augments the model by learning a\nlightweight adapter with a small amount of parameter learning overhead in each\nincremental stage. The adapter is responsible for adapting the model to new\nclasses, it can inherit and propagate the representation capability from the\ncurrent model through parallel connection between them by a transfer gate. As a\nresult, this design guarantees a smooth representation shift between different\nincremental stages. Furthermore, to alleviate inconsistency and enable\ncomparable feature representations across incremental stages, we design the\nDecoupled Anchor Supervision (DAS). It decouples constraints of positive and\nnegative samples by respectively comparing them with the virtual anchor. This\ndecoupling promotes discriminative representation learning and aligns the\nfeature spaces learned at different stages, thereby narrowing the gap between\nstage-wise local optimization over a subset of data and global inference across\nall classes.

These sentinels enable protection verification through\nrandomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure\nseamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the\nsentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel\neffectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation\nquality for authorized applications.

To be published in IEEE proceedings", "summary": "One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype\nrepresentation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical\nvariability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on\ndeterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations\nthat fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization.\nThis work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that\nreformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space\nexploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability\ndistributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically\ncoherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates\nthrough three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement\nmodule that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via\nforward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism\nthat leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics,\nand (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while\nmaximizing representational diversity.

Despite\nthe remarkable progress made by existing graph few-shot learning methods,\nseveral key limitations remain. First, most current approaches rely on\npredefined and unified graph filters (e.g., low-pass or high-pass filters) to\nglobally enhance or suppress node frequency signals. Such fixed spectral\noperations fail to account for the heterogeneity of local topological\nstructures inherent in real-world graphs. Moreover, these methods often assume\nthat the support and query sets are drawn from the same distribution. However,\nunder few-shot conditions, the limited labeled data in the support set may not\nsufficiently capture the complex distribution of the query set, leading to\nsuboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose GRACE, a\nnovel Graph few-shot leaRning framework that integrates Adaptive spectrum\nexperts with Cross-sEt distribution calibration techniques.

Its main goal is to integrate\nmultimodal information to produce enhanced images that are better suited for\ndownstream tasks. Although deep learning based fusion methods have made\nsignificant progress, mainstream unsupervised approaches still face serious\nchallenges in practical applications. Existing methods mostly rely on manually\ndesigned loss functions to guide the fusion process. However, these loss\nfunctions have obvious limitations. On one hand, the reference images\nconstructed by existing methods often lack details and have uneven brightness.\nOn the other hand, the widely used gradient losses focus only on gradient\nmagnitude. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an angle-based\nperception framework for spatial-sensitive image fusion (AngularFuse). At\nfirst, we design a cross-modal complementary mask module to force the network\nto learn complementary information between modalities. Then, a fine-grained\nreference image synthesis strategy is introduced. By combining Laplacian edge\nenhancement with adaptive histogram equalization, reference images with richer\ndetails and more balanced brightness are generated. Last but not least, we\nintroduce an angle-aware loss, which for the first time constrains both\ngradient magnitude and direction simultaneously in the gradient domain.\nAngularFuse ensures that the fused images preserve both texture intensity and\ncorrect edge orientation. Comprehensive experiments on the MSRS, RoadScene, and\nM3FD public datasets show that AngularFuse outperforms existing mainstream\nmethods with clear margin.

Together, these findings reveal that VLMs often rely on symbolic\npriors rather than genuine glyph perception, particularly for iconic circular\nlogos, and that projector subspaces play a decisive role in this failure mode.\nOur work contributes both a novel diagnostic lens and actionable mitigation\ninsights, highlighting projector disentanglement and OCR-guided decoding as\npromising directions for building more trustworthy multimodal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u65e0\u6587\u5b57\u6807\u5fd7\uff08logo\uff09\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u54c1\u724c\u540d\u79f0\u6216\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u5148\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "VLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u65e0\u6587\u5b57\u6807\u5fd7\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u54c1\u724c\u540d\u79f0\u6216\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7eaf\u7b26\u53f7\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u542b\u6587\u672c\u6807\u5fd7\u7684\u5206\u5272\u96c6\u53caHard-60\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u91cfVLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u548c\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5e7b\u89c9\u4e0e\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u7684\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u6d88\u878d\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u8bef\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5706\u5f62\u6807\u5fd7\u5c24\u5176\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86VLMs\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u5668\u89e3\u8026\u548cOCR\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional generative models that\nrely on iterative sampling or adversarial objectives, CFM learns a continuous\nflow between a noise distribution and target data distributions through the\ndirect regression of an optimal velocity field. We evaluate this approach in\nthe context of low-field magnetic resonance imaging (LF-MRI), a rapidly\nemerging modality that offers affordable and portable scanning but suffers from\ninherently low signal-to-noise ratio and reduced diagnostic quality.

To address these challenges,\nwe propose a general Fourier feature physics-informed extreme learning machine\n(GFF-PIELM). We demonstrate that directly concatenating multiple Fourier\nfeature mappings (FFMs) and an extreme learning machine (ELM) network makes it\ndifficult to determine frequency-related hyperparameters. Fortunately, we find\nan alternative to establish the GFF-PIELM in three main steps. First, we\nintegrate a variation of FFM into ELM as the Fourier-based activation function,\nso there is still one hidden layer in the GFF-PIELM framework. Second, we\nassign a set of frequency coefficients to the hidden neurons, which enables ELM\nnetwork to capture diverse frequency components of target solutions.

The literature\ntypically distinguishes between two settings: infinite inventory, where the\nfirm has unlimited stock and time to sell, and finite inventory, where both\ninventory and selling horizon are limited. In both cases, the central challenge\nlies in the fact that the demand function -- how sales respond to price -- is\nunknown and must be learned from data.

We conduct extensive empirical studies, from single-objective\noptimisation to modern image classification tasks, showing that sharper minima\noften emerge when models are regularised (e.g., via SAM, weight decay, or data\naugmentation), and that these sharp minima can coincide with better\ngeneralisation, calibration, robustness, and functional consistency.

Identifying these latent dynamics requires solving two intertwined\nproblems: discovering appropriate coarse-grained variables and simultaneously\nfitting the governing equations. Most machine learning approaches tackle these\ntasks jointly by training autoencoders together with models that enforce\ndynamical consistency. We propose to decouple the two problems by leveraging\nthe recently introduced Foundation Inference Models (FIMs).

This global\nsynchronization is ill-suited for the highly skewed and evolving distribution\nof trajectory generation latency in RL training, crippling training efficiency.\nOur key insight is that efficient scaling requires breaking this lockstep\nthrough trajectory-level asynchrony, which generates and consumes each\ntrajectory independently.

For neuromorphic vision\n(e.g., event cameras), however, the lack of robust data association makes\nsolving the two problems separately an ill-posed challenge, especially in the\nabsence of supervision via ground truth. Existing works mitigate this\nill-posedness by either enforcing the smoothness of the flow field via an\nexplicit variational regularizer or leveraging explicit structure-and-motion\npriors in the parametrization to improve event alignment. The former notably\nintroduces bias in results and computational overhead, while the latter, which\nparametrizes the optical flow in terms of the scene depth and the camera\nmotion, often converges to suboptimal local minima. To address these issues, we\npropose an unsupervised framework that jointly optimizes egomotion and optical\nflow via implicit spatial-temporal and geometric regularization. First, by\nmodeling camera's egomotion as a continuous spline and optical flow as an\nimplicit neural representation, our method inherently embeds spatial-temporal\ncoherence through inductive biases. Second, we incorporate structure-and-motion\npriors through differential geometric constraints, bypassing explicit depth\nestimation while maintaining rigorous geometric consistency.

This limitation renders them oblivious to crucial\ninformation from diverse covariates in real-world forecasting tasks.

With preserved\nbackbones of foundation models as frozen feature extractors, the outcome\nembeddings from foundation models are empirically demonstrated more informative\nthan raw data.

Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use\nthe last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train\nlarge unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands\nsubstantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its\naccessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model\nconditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a\nunified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention\nPooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level\ndetails from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion\ngenerative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion\narchitectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of\nvisual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We\npropose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI),\nwhich conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens\ngenerated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting.

To address this, we\nintroduce CARVQ, a post-training novel Corrective Adaptor combined with group\nResidual Vector Quantization. CARVQ relies on the composition of both linear\nand non-linear maps and mimics the original model embedding to compress to\napproximately 1.6 bits without requiring specialized hardware to support\nlower-bit storage.

In the standard VI pipeline, an\nanalyst estimates VI for a single predictive model with only the observed\nfeatures. However, the importance of a feature depends heavily on which other\nvariables are included in the model, and essential variables are often omitted\nfrom observational datasets. Moreover, the VI estimated for one model is often\nnot the same as the VI estimated for another equally-good model - a phenomenon\nknown as the Rashomon Effect. We address these gaps by introducing\nUNobservables and Inference for Variable importancE using Rashomon SEts\n(UNIVERSE).

We\npresent KoALA (KL-L0 Adversarial detection via Label Agreement), a novel,\nsemantics-free adversarial detector that requires no architectural changes or\nadversarial retraining. KoALA operates on a simple principle: it detects an\nadversarial attack when class predictions from two complementary similarity\nmetrics disagree. These metrics-KL divergence and an L0-based similarity-are\nspecifically chosen to detect different types of perturbations. The KL\ndivergence metric is sensitive to dense, low-amplitude shifts, while the\nL0-based similarity is designed for sparse, high-impact changes. We provide a\nformal proof of correctness for our approach. The only training required is a\nsimple fine-tuning step on a pre-trained image encoder using clean images to\nensure the embeddings align well with both metrics. This makes KOALA a\nlightweight, plug-and-play solution for existing models and various data\nmodalities. Our extensive experiments on ResNet/CIFAR-10 and CLIP/Tiny-ImageNet\nconfirm our theoretical claims.

For\na single decision maker, designing an optimal predictor is equivalent to\nminimizing a proper loss function corresponding to the negative utility of that\nindividual. For multiple decision makers, our problem can be viewed as a\nvariant of omniprediction in which the goal is to design a single predictor\nthat simultaneously minimizes multiple losses. Existing algorithms for\nachieving omniprediction broadly fall into two categories: 1) boosting methods\nthat optimize other auxiliary targets such as multicalibration and obtain\nomniprediction as a corollary, and 2) adversarial two-player game based\napproaches that estimate and respond to the ``worst-case\" loss in an online\nfashion. We give lower bounds demonstrating that multicalibration is a strictly\nmore difficult problem than omniprediction and thus the former approach must\nincur suboptimal sample complexity. For the latter approach, we discuss how\nthese ideas can be used to obtain a sample-efficient algorithm through an\nonline-to-batch conversion.
