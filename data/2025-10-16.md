### [1] [SimULi: Real-Time LiDAR and Camera Simulation with Unscented Transforms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12901)
*Haithem Turki,Qi Wu,Xin Kang,Janick Martinez Esturo,Shengyu Huang,Ruilong Li,Zan Gojcic,Riccardo de Lutio*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimULi是一种实时渲染任意相机模型和LiDAR数据的方法，解决了现有方法在跨传感器一致性和渲染速度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经渲染方法在渲染速度和跨传感器一致性上存在局限，无法满足自动驾驶等高保真模拟需求。

Method: 扩展3DGUT支持LiDAR，采用自动分块策略和基于光线的剔除技术，设计因子化3D高斯表示和锚定策略。

Result: SimULi渲染速度比光线追踪快10-20倍，比现有基于光栅化的方法快1.5-10倍，且在跨传感器一致性上误差降低40%。

Conclusion: SimULi在多个相机和LiDAR指标上达到或超越现有最优方法，适用于自动驾驶等高保真模拟场景。

Abstract: Rigorous testing of autonomous robots, such as self-driving vehicles, is
essential to ensure their safety in real-world deployments. This requires
building high-fidelity simulators to test scenarios beyond those that can be
safely or exhaustively collected in the real-world. Existing neural rendering
methods based on NeRF and 3DGS hold promise but suffer from low rendering
speeds or can only render pinhole camera models, hindering their suitability to
applications that commonly require high-distortion lenses and LiDAR data.
Multi-sensor simulation poses additional challenges as existing methods handle
cross-sensor inconsistencies by favoring the quality of one modality at the
expense of others. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimULi, the first
method capable of rendering arbitrary camera models and LiDAR data in
real-time. Our method extends 3DGUT, which natively supports complex camera
models, with LiDAR support, via an automated tiling strategy for arbitrary
spinning LiDAR models and ray-based culling. To address cross-sensor
inconsistencies, we design a factorized 3D Gaussian representation and
anchoring strategy that reduces mean camera and depth error by up to 40%
compared to existing methods. SimULi renders 10-20x faster than ray tracing
approaches and 1.5-10x faster than prior rasterization-based work (and handles
a wider range of camera models). When evaluated on two widely benchmarked
autonomous driving datasets, SimULi matches or exceeds the fidelity of existing
state-of-the-art methods across numerous camera and LiDAR metrics.

### [2] [State-Change Learning for Prediction of Future Events in Endoscopic Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12904)
*Saurav Sharma,Chinedu Innocent Nwoye,Didier Mutter,Nicolas Padoy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SurgFUTR通过状态变化学习预测手术未来事件，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前手术AI研究集中于理解现状而非预测未来，缺乏统一方法。

Method: 采用教师-学生架构和状态表示压缩，结合Action Dynamics模块。

Result: 在四个数据集和三个手术中表现一致提升，验证了跨手术通用性。

Conclusion: SurgFUTR为手术未来预测提供了统一且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical future prediction, driven by real-time AI analysis of surgical
video, is critical for operating room safety and efficiency. It provides
actionable insights into upcoming events, their timing, and risks-enabling
better resource allocation, timely instrument readiness, and early warnings for
complications (e.g., bleeding, bile duct injury). Despite this need, current
surgical AI research focuses on understanding what is happening rather than
predicting future events. Existing methods target specific tasks in isolation,
lacking unified approaches that span both short-term (action triplets, events)
and long-term horizons (remaining surgery duration, phase transitions). These
methods rely on coarse-grained supervision while fine-grained surgical action
triplets and steps remain underexplored. Furthermore, methods based only on
future feature prediction struggle to generalize across different surgical
contexts and procedures. We address these limits by reframing surgical future
prediction as state-change learning. Rather than forecasting raw observations,
our approach classifies state transitions between current and future timesteps.
We introduce SurgFUTR, implementing this through a teacher-student
architecture. Video clips are compressed into state representations via
Sinkhorn-Knopp clustering; the teacher network learns from both current and
future clips, while the student network predicts future states from current
videos alone, guided by our Action Dynamics (ActDyn) module. We establish
SFPBench with five prediction tasks spanning short-term (triplets, events) and
long-term (remaining surgery duration, phase and step transitions) horizons.
Experiments across four datasets and three procedures show consistent
improvements. Cross-procedure transfer validates generalizability.

### [3] [Robust Plant Disease Diagnosis with Few Target-Domain Samples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12909)
*Takafumi Nogami,Satoshi Kagiwada,Hitoshi Iyatomi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TMPS框架通过目标感知度量学习和优先采样，显著提升了植物病害诊断模型在未见领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习模型在训练环境外的图像上诊断准确率下降，主要由于训练数据多样性不足和领域差距。

Method: 提出TMPS框架，利用目标域少量标记样本进行度量学习，优化模型泛化能力。

Result: 在包含223,073张叶片图像的数据集上，TMPS仅需每病害10个目标域样本，即显著超越基线和其他方法。

Conclusion: TMPS通过有效利用目标域样本，显著提升了植物病害诊断的鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Various deep learning-based systems have been proposed for accurate and
convenient plant disease diagnosis, achieving impressive performance. However,
recent studies show that these systems often fail to maintain diagnostic
accuracy on images captured under different conditions from the training
environment -- an essential criterion for model robustness. Many deep learning
methods have shown high accuracy in plant disease diagnosis. However, they
often struggle to generalize to images taken in conditions that differ from the
training setting. This drop in performance stems from the subtle variability of
disease symptoms and domain gaps -- differences in image context and
environment. The root cause is the limited diversity of training data relative
to task complexity, making even advanced models vulnerable in unseen domains.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a simple yet highly adaptable learning
framework called Target-Aware Metric Learning with Prioritized Sampling (TMPS),
grounded in metric learning. TMPS operates under the assumption of access to a
limited number of labeled samples from the target (deployment) domain and
leverages these samples effectively to improve diagnostic robustness. We assess
TMPS on a large-scale automated plant disease diagnostic task using a dataset
comprising 223,073 leaf images sourced from 23 agricultural fields, spanning 21
diseases and healthy instances across three crop species. By incorporating just
10 target domain samples per disease into training, TMPS surpasses models
trained using the same combined source and target samples, and those fine-tuned
with these target samples after pre-training on source data. It achieves
average macro F1 score improvements of 7.3 and 3.6 points, respectively, and a
remarkable 18.7 and 17.1 point improvement over the baseline and conventional
metric learning.

*Sanghyun Byun,Jung Ick Guack,Mohanad Odema,Baisub Lee,Jacob Song,Woo Seong Chung*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViZer是一个无需标签的视觉-语言对齐框架，通过增强训练提升图像描述生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型依赖标注数据，限制了其扩展性和未标注数据的利用。

Method: ViZer在训练中主动对齐视觉和语言表示特征，无需文本标签或完整重训练。

Result: 在SmolVLM-Base和Qwen2-VL上，ViZer生成更接地气和描述性更强的标题。

Conclusion: ViZer为零标签视觉-语言任务提供了实用解决方案，且在定性评估中表现优异。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) achieve remarkable performance through
large-scale image-text pretraining. However, their reliance on labeled image
datasets limits scalability and leaves vast amounts of unlabeled image data
underutilized. To address this, we propose Unified Vision-Language Alignment
for Zero-Label Enhancement (ViZer), an enhancement training framework that
enables zero-label learning in image captioning, providing a practical starting
point for broader zero-label adaptation in vision-language tasks. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on human or synthetically annotated datasets, ViZer
actively aligns vision and language representation features during training,
enabling existing VLMs to generate improved captions without requiring text
labels or full retraining. We demonstrate ViZer's advantage in qualitative
evaluation, as automated caption metrics such as CIDEr and BERTScore often
penalize details that are absent in reference captions. Applying ViZer on
SmolVLM-Base and Qwen2-VL, we observe consistent qualitative improvements,
producing captions that are more grounded and descriptive than their baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FetalMind是一个针对胎儿超声的医疗AI系统，通过Salient Epistemic Disentanglement（SED）方法，结合专家知识图谱和强化学习，显著提升了报告生成和诊断的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型在胎儿超声领域表现不佳，主要由于多视图推理、疾病多样性和图像异质性等挑战。

Method: 提出SED方法，通过专家知识图谱解耦视图-疾病关联，并结合强化学习优化临床推理步骤。

Result: FetalMind在各项任务中表现优异，平均提升14%，关键病例准确率提高61.2%。

Conclusion: FetalMind通过创新的SED方法和大规模数据集FetalSigma-1M，成功解决了胎儿超声领域的挑战，具有高效、稳定和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent medical vision-language models have shown promise on tasks such as
VQA, report generation, and anomaly detection. However, most are adapted to
structured adult imaging and underperform in fetal ultrasound, which poses
challenges of multi-view image reasoning, numerous diseases, and image
diversity. To bridge this gap, we introduce FetalMind, a medical AI system
tailored to fetal ultrasound for both report generation and diagnosis. Guided
by clinical workflow, we propose Salient Epistemic Disentanglement (SED), which
injects an expert-curated bipartite graph into the model to decouple
view-disease associations and to steer preference selection along clinically
faithful steps via reinforcement learning. This design mitigates variability
across diseases and heterogeneity across views, reducing learning bottlenecks
while aligning the model's inference with obstetric practice. To train
FetalMind at scale, we curate FetalSigma-1M dataset, the first large-scale
fetal ultrasound report corpus, comprising 20K reports from twelve medical
centers, addressing the scarcity of domain data. Extensive experiments show
that FetalMind outperforms open- and closed-source baselines across all
gestational stages, achieving +14% average gains and +61.2% higher accuracy on
critical conditions while remaining efficient, stable, and scalable. Project

### [6] [CADE 2.5 - ZeResFDG: Frequency-Decoupled, Rescaled and Zero-Projected Guidance for SD/SDXL Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12954)
*Denis Rychkovskiy,GPT-5*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADE 2.5是一个用于SD/SDXL潜在扩散模型的采样器级指导堆栈，通过ZeResFDG模块和QSilk稳定器提升图像清晰度、提示符遵循和抗伪影能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升潜在扩散模型在采样阶段的图像质量，包括清晰度、提示符遵循和抗伪影控制。

Method: 结合频率解耦指导、能量重缩放和零投影的ZeResFDG模块，以及训练无关的QSilk稳定器。

Result: 在中等指导尺度下显著提升图像质量，无需重新训练。

Conclusion: CADE 2.5为SD/SDXL模型提供了一种高效且无需训练的改进方案。

Abstract: We introduce CADE 2.5 (Comfy Adaptive Detail Enhancer), a sampler-level
guidance stack for SD/SDXL latent diffusion models. The central module,
ZeResFDG, unifies (i) frequency-decoupled guidance that reweights low- and
high-frequency components of the guidance signal, (ii) energy rescaling that
matches the per-sample magnitude of the guided prediction to the positive
branch, and (iii) zero-projection that removes the component parallel to the
unconditional direction. A lightweight spectral EMA with hysteresis switches
between a conservative and a detail-seeking mode as structure crystallizes
during sampling. Across SD/SDXL samplers, ZeResFDG improves sharpness, prompt
adherence, and artifact control at moderate guidance scales without any
retraining. In addition, we employ a training-free inference-time stabilizer,
QSilk Micrograin Stabilizer (quantile clamp + depth/edge-gated micro-detail
injection), which improves robustness and yields natural high-frequency
micro-texture at high resolutions with negligible overhead. For completeness we
note that the same rule is compatible with alternative parameterizations (e.g.,
velocity), which we briefly discuss in the Appendix; however, this paper
focuses on SD/SDXL latent diffusion models.

*Tianyu Zhang,Suyuchen Wang,Chao Wang,Juan Rodriguez,Ahmed Masry,Xiangru Jian,Yoshua Bengio,Perouz Taslakian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCOPE框架通过动态选择专用编码器，显著降低计算成本并提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多视觉编码器堆叠会导致计算成本增加但性能提升有限，需要更智能的编码器选择方法。

Method: 提出SCOPE框架，采用混合编码器（MoEnc）动态选择专用编码器，通过轻量级路由器和双熵正则化训练。

Result: SCOPE仅使用一个共享和一个路由编码器，性能优于同时使用四个编码器的模型，计算成本降低24-49%。

Conclusion: 智能编码器选择优于暴力聚合，挑战了多编码器VLMs的现有范式。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) benefit from multiple vision encoders, but
naively stacking them yields diminishing returns while multiplying inference
costs. We propose SCOPE, a Mixture-of-Encoders (MoEnc) framework that
dynamically selects one specialized encoder per image-text pair via
instance-level routing, unlike token-level routing in traditional MoE. SCOPE
maintains a shared encoder and a pool of routed encoders. A lightweight router
uses cross-attention between text prompts and shared visual features to select
the optimal encoder from the routed encoders. To train this router, we
introduce dual entropy regularization with auxiliary losses to balance
dataset-level load distribution with instance-level routing confidence.
Remarkably, SCOPE with one shared plus one routed encoder outperforms models
using all four extra encoders simultaneously, while reducing compute by
24-49\%. This demonstrates that intelligent encoder selection beats brute-force
aggregation, challenging the prevailing paradigm in multi-encoder VLMs.

### [8] [SVAG-Bench: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Multi-Instance Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13016)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新任务SVAG，用于在视频中同时检测、跟踪和时间定位动作相关的对象，并构建了SVAG-Bench基准和SVAGFormer基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注粗粒度动作识别或通用对象跟踪，忽略了联合检测和跟踪动作相关对象的需求。

Method: 提出了SVAG任务，构建了SVAG-Bench基准，并开发了SVAGFormer基线模型和SVAGEval评估工具包。

Result: 现有模型在SVAG任务上表现不佳，尤其是在密集或复杂场景中。

Conclusion: 需要更先进的推理方法来处理长视频中细粒度的对象-动作交互。

Abstract: Understanding fine-grained actions and accurately localizing their
corresponding actors in space and time are fundamental capabilities for
advancing next-generation AI systems, including embodied agents, autonomous
platforms, and human-AI interaction frameworks. Despite recent progress in
video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either
coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby
overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects
according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this
gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task
that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize
all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their
actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark
comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering
a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose
SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language
models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a
standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking.
Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG,
particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more
advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SeqBench是一个用于评估文本到视频（T2V）生成中叙事连贯性的新基准，包含320个提示和2,560个人工标注视频，并提出了一种基于动态时间图（DTG）的自动评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2V模型在生成连贯的叙事序列方面表现不佳，且缺乏相关评估标准。

Method: 设计了SeqBench数据集和基于DTG的自动评估指标，用于评估叙事连贯性。

Result: 发现当前T2V模型在多动作序列中难以保持对象状态一致性，且时序关系处理不佳。

Conclusion: SeqBench为评估和改进T2V模型的叙事连贯性提供了系统框架。

Abstract: Text-to-video (T2V) generation models have made significant progress in
creating visually appealing videos. However, they struggle with generating
coherent sequential narratives that require logical progression through
multiple events. Existing T2V benchmarks primarily focus on visual quality
metrics but fail to evaluate narrative coherence over extended sequences. To
bridge this gap, we present SeqBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
sequential narrative coherence in T2V generation. SeqBench includes a carefully
designed dataset of 320 prompts spanning various narrative complexities, with
2,560 human-annotated videos generated from 8 state-of-the-art T2V models.
Additionally, we design a Dynamic Temporal Graphs (DTG)-based automatic
evaluation metric, which can efficiently capture long-range dependencies and
temporal ordering while maintaining computational efficiency. Our DTG-based
metric demonstrates a strong correlation with human annotations. Through
systematic evaluation using SeqBench, we reveal critical limitations in current
T2V models: failure to maintain consistent object states across multi-action
sequences, physically implausible results in multi-object scenarios, and
difficulties in preserving realistic timing and ordering relationships between
sequential actions. SeqBench provides the first systematic framework for
evaluating narrative coherence in T2V generation and offers concrete insights
for improving sequential reasoning capabilities in future models. Please refer

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SceneAdapt框架通过两阶段适应（中间帧生成和场景感知中间帧生成）将场景感知注入文本条件运动模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅单独处理运动语义或场景感知，缺乏同时覆盖两者的数据集。

Method: 利用不相交的场景-运动和文本-运动数据集，通过中间帧生成作为代理任务，注入场景感知。

Result: 实验表明SceneAdapt成功将场景感知注入文本到运动模型。

Conclusion: SceneAdapt通过两阶段适应有效结合了运动语义和场景感知。

Abstract: Human motion is inherently diverse and semantically rich, while also shaped
by the surrounding scene. However, existing motion generation approaches
address either motion semantics or scene-awareness in isolation, since
constructing large-scale datasets with both rich text--motion coverage and
precise scene interactions is extremely challenging. In this work, we introduce
SceneAdapt, a framework that injects scene awareness into text-conditioned
motion models by leveraging disjoint scene--motion and text--motion datasets
through two adaptation stages: inbetweening and scene-aware inbetweening. The
key idea is to use motion inbetweening, learnable without text, as a proxy task
to bridge two distinct datasets and thereby inject scene-awareness to
text-to-motion models. In the first stage, we introduce keyframing layers that
modulate motion latents for inbetweening while preserving the latent manifold.
In the second stage, we add a scene-conditioning layer that injects scene
geometry by adaptively querying local context through cross-attention.
Experimental results show that SceneAdapt effectively injects scene awareness
into text-to-motion models, and we further analyze the mechanisms through which
this awareness emerges. Code and models will be released.

*Huawei Jiang,Husna Mutahira,Gan Huang,Mannan Saeed Muhammad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型的混合框架（1D-CNN-ECG-Mamba），用于心电图异常检测，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在处理长序列心电图信号时性能有限，需要更高效的序列建模方法。

Method: 结合卷积特征提取和Mamba状态空间模型，通过双向Vision Mamba增强时间依赖性表示。

Result: 在PhysioNet 2020和2021数据集上，AUPRC和AUROC得分显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mamba架构在ECG分类中具有潜力，可支持早期诊断和远程医疗。

Abstract: Accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities from electrocardiogram recordings
is regarded as essential for clinical diagnostics and decision support.
Traditional deep learning models such as residual networks and transformer
architectures have been applied successfully to this task, but their
performance has been limited when long sequential signals are processed.
Recently, state space models have been introduced as an efficient alternative.
In this study, a hybrid framework named One Dimensional Convolutional Neural
Network Electrocardiogram Mamba is introduced, in which convolutional feature
extraction is combined with Mamba, a selective state space model designed for
effective sequence modeling. The model is built upon Vision Mamba, a
bidirectional variant through which the representation of temporal dependencies
in electrocardiogram data is enhanced. Comprehensive experiments on the
PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenges of 2020 and 2021 were conducted,
and superior performance compared with existing methods was achieved.
Specifically, the proposed model achieved substantially higher AUPRC and AUROC
scores than those reported by the best previously published algorithms on
twelve lead electrocardiograms. These results demonstrate the potential of
Mamba-based architectures to advance reliable ECG classification. This
capability supports early diagnosis and personalized treatment, while enhancing
accessibility in telemedicine and resource-constrained healthcare systems.

*Thomas W. Mitchel,Hyunwoo Ryu,Vincent Sitzmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: XFactor是一种无需几何先验的自监督模型，首次实现了真正的新视角合成（NVS），其关键标准是姿态的可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督NVS模型的预测姿态缺乏可迁移性，导致相同姿态在不同场景中生成不同的相机轨迹。

Method: XFactor结合成对姿态估计和输入输出增强方案，解耦相机姿态与场景内容，无需3D几何先验。

Result: XFactor在无约束潜在姿态变量下实现可迁移性，显著优于现有方法，且潜在姿态与实际姿态高度相关。

Conclusion: XFactor证明了无需显式几何先验即可实现可迁移的NVS，为自监督学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we identify that the key criterion for determining whether a
model is truly capable of novel view synthesis (NVS) is transferability:
Whether any pose representation extracted from one video sequence can be used
to re-render the same camera trajectory in another. We analyze prior work on
self-supervised NVS and find that their predicted poses do not transfer: The
same set of poses lead to different camera trajectories in different 3D scenes.
Here, we present XFactor, the first geometry-free self-supervised model capable
of true NVS. XFactor combines pair-wise pose estimation with a simple
augmentation scheme of the inputs and outputs that jointly enables
disentangling camera pose from scene content and facilitates geometric
reasoning. Remarkably, we show that XFactor achieves transferability with
unconstrained latent pose variables, without any 3D inductive biases or
concepts from multi-view geometry -- such as an explicit parameterization of
poses as elements of SE(3). We introduce a new metric to quantify
transferability, and through large-scale experiments, we demonstrate that
XFactor significantly outperforms prior pose-free NVS transformers, and show
that latent poses are highly correlated with real-world poses through probing
experiments.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种方向感知的多尺度梯度损失函数，用于红外与可见光图像融合，提升边缘清晰度和纹理保留。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过梯度幅值损失监督训练，但忽略了方向信息，导致边缘模糊和纹理损失。

Method: 引入方向感知的多尺度梯度损失，分别监督水平和垂直梯度分量，并保留其符号。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在不改变模型架构或训练协议的情况下，显著提升了边缘对齐和纹理保留效果。

Conclusion: 方向感知的梯度损失为图像融合提供了更清晰的监督信号，提升了融合质量。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion aims to integrate complementary information
from co-registered source images to produce a single, informative result. Most
learning-based approaches train with a combination of structural similarity
loss, intensity reconstruction loss, and a gradient-magnitude term. However,
collapsing gradients to their magnitude removes directional information,
yielding ambiguous supervision and suboptimal edge fidelity. We introduce a
direction-aware, multi-scale gradient loss that supervises horizontal and
vertical components separately and preserves their sign across scales. This
axis-wise, sign-preserving objective provides clear directional guidance at
both fine and coarse resolutions, promoting sharper, better-aligned edges and
richer texture preservation without changing model architectures or training
protocols. Experiments on open-source model and multiple public benchmarks
demonstrate effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在不同数据集上因域偏移（风格和内容变化）导致的性能下降问题，特别是在海马体分割任务中。

Method: 结合z归一化风格协调和双向可变形图像配准（DIR）策略，DIR网络与分割和判别器网络联合训练，生成解剖学合理的变换。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效应对不同人群的海马体分割任务，尤其在内容变化显著的情况下表现优异。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when
deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both
image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical
characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts
encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific
emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style
harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image
registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with
segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect
to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations
that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through
comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for
controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets
representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all
experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus
segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical
dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in
Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains
observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight
the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across
diverse populations.

in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still
often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with
real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating
beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible
methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders
progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for
designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this
work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which
we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect
number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six
fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this
end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting
criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets,
we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting
hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in
DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial
noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their
correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this
widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations
consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically
quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the
investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.

TL;DR: Edit-Your-Interest是一种轻量级、文本驱动的零样本视频编辑方法，通过时空特征存储和特征传播技术显著提升效率和视觉保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频编辑方法计算开销高、内存消耗大，且常导致时间不一致性和视觉伪影（如模糊和马赛克）。

Method: 引入时空特征存储库（SFM）缓存关键特征，提出特征最相似传播（FMP）保持时间一致性，并设计SFM更新算法动态刷新缓存。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在效率和视觉保真度上均优于现有技术。

Conclusion: Edit-Your-Interest通过高效的特征管理和传播技术，实现了高质量的视频编辑，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have recently demonstrated significant
progress in video editing.
  However, existing video editing methods are severely limited by their high
computational overhead and memory consumption.
  Furthermore, these approaches often sacrifice visual fidelity, leading to
undesirable temporal inconsistencies and artifacts such as blurring and
pronounced mosaic-like patterns.
  We propose Edit-Your-Interest, a lightweight, text-driven, zero-shot video
editing method.
  Edit-Your-Interest introduces a spatio-temporal feature memory to cache
features from previous frames, significantly reducing computational overhead
compared to full-sequence spatio-temporal modeling approaches.
  Specifically, we first introduce a Spatio-Temporal Feature Memory bank (SFM),
which is designed to efficiently cache and retain the crucial image tokens
processed by spatial attention.
  Second, we propose the Feature Most-Similar Propagation (FMP) method. FMP
propagates the most relevant tokens from previous frames to subsequent ones,
preserving temporal consistency.
  Finally, we introduce an SFM update algorithm that continuously refreshes the
cached features, ensuring their long-term relevance and effectiveness
throughout the video sequence.
  Furthermore, we leverage cross-attention maps to automatically extract masks
for the instances of interest.
  These masks are seamlessly integrated into the diffusion denoising process,
enabling fine-grained control over target objects and allowing
Edit-Your-Interest to perform highly accurate edits while robustly preserving
the background integrity.
  Extensive experiments decisively demonstrate that the proposed
Edit-Your-Interest outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and
visual fidelity, validating its superior effectiveness and practicality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，用于提升AI在社交互动中的干预时机检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLMs缺乏社交意识，导致干预时机不当，影响用户体验。

Method: 提出EgoSocial数据集和EgoSoD方法，结合多模态上下文线索建模社交动态。

Result: EgoSoD显著提升了干预时机检测和社交互动性能（如Phi-4提升45.6%）。

Conclusion: EgoSoD方法有效解决了AI在社交互动中的干预问题，未来将公开数据集和代码。

Abstract: As AR/VR technologies become integral to daily life, there's a growing need
for AI that understands human social dynamics from an egocentric perspective.
However, current LLMs often lack the social awareness to discern when to
intervene as AI assistant. This leads to constant, socially unaware responses
that may disrupt natural conversation and negatively impact user focus. To
address these limitations, we introduce EgoSocial, a large-scale egocentric
dataset with 13,500 social video-question pairs, specifically designed to
benchmark intervention in social interaction perception. We also present an
in-depth analysis of current omnimodal LLMs (OLLMs) to assess their
effectiveness in detecting diverse social contextual cues. Experiments show
that OLLMs still struggle to detect the intervention timing (14.4% for Gemini
2.5 Pro). We also propose EgoSoD (EgoSocial Detection), an end-to-end method
for robustly discerning social dynamics. Informed by our OLLM analysis, EgoSoD
integrates multimodal contextual cues (e.g., audio and visual cues) into a
social thinking graph, dynamically modeling participants and interactions. Our
method proactively detects intervention timing and social interactions,
precisely determining when to intervene. Our EgoSoD improves Phi-4 by 45.6% and
Gemini 2.5 Pro by 9.9% on Intervention Timing performance, and improves Phi-4
by 20.4% and Gemini 2.5 Pro by 6.9% on overall Social Interaction performance.
We will release the dataset and code soon.

Conclusion: DriveCritic为自动驾驶系统评估提供了更可靠、与人类判断一致的基础。

Abstract: Benchmarking autonomous driving planners to align with human judgment remains
a critical challenge, as state-of-the-art metrics like the Extended Predictive
Driver Model Score (EPDMS) lack context awareness in nuanced scenarios. To
address this, we introduce DriveCritic, a novel framework featuring two key
contributions: the DriveCritic dataset, a curated collection of challenging
scenarios where context is critical for correct judgment and annotated with
pairwise human preferences, and the DriveCritic model, a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) based evaluator. Fine-tuned using a two-stage supervised and
reinforcement learning pipeline, the DriveCritic model learns to adjudicate
between trajectory pairs by integrating visual and symbolic context.
Experiments show DriveCritic significantly outperforms existing metrics and
baselines in matching human preferences and demonstrates strong context
awareness. Overall, our work provides a more reliable, human-aligned foundation
to evaluating autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: VPreg在图像配准中表现出色，尤其在微分同胚变换和逆映射准确性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: This paper introduces VPreg, a novel diffeomorphic image registration method.
This work provides several improvements to our past work on mesh generation and
diffeomorphic image registration. VPreg aims to achieve excellent registration
accuracy while controlling the quality of the registration transformations. It
ensures a positive Jacobian determinant of the spatial transformation and
provides an accurate approximation of the inverse of the registration, a
crucial property for many neuroimaging workflows. Unlike conventional methods,
VPreg generates this inverse transformation within the group of diffeomorphisms
rather than operating on the image space. The core of VPreg is a grid
generation approach, referred to as \emph{Variational Principle} (VP), which
constructs non-folding grids with prescribed Jacobian determinant and curl.
These VP-generated grids guarantee diffeomorphic spatial transformations
essential for computational anatomy and morphometry, and provide a more
accurate inverse than existing methods. To assess the potential of the proposed
approach, we conduct a performance analysis for 150 registrations of brain
scans from the OASIS-1 dataset. Performance evaluation based on Dice scores for
35 regions of interest, along with an empirical analysis of the properties of
the computed spatial transformations, demonstrates that VPreg outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in terms of Dice scores, regularity properties of the
computed transformation, and accuracy and consistency of the provided inverse
map. We compare our results to ANTs-SyN, Freesurfer-Easyreg, and FSL-Fnirt.

Motivation: 解决文本和图像模态间信息熵不平衡导致的跨模态检索性能不足的问题。

Method: 1) 设计不依赖任务域显式知识的提示模板，增强文本模态的多义性描述；2) 使用超图适配器构建多边连接，纠正同义语义的匹配误差。

Result: 在Flickr30K和MS-COCO基准测试中，文本到图像和图像到文本的检索性能分别提升了16.8%和40.1%。

Conclusion: OS-HGAdapter方法在语义对齐任务中实现了新的最优性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Text-image alignment constitutes a foundational challenge in multimedia
content understanding, where effective modeling of cross-modal semantic
correspondences critically enhances retrieval system performance through joint
embedding space optimization. Given the inherent difference in information
entropy between texts and images, conventional approaches often show an
imbalance in the mutual retrieval of these two modalities. To address this
particular challenge, we propose to use the open semantic knowledge of Large
Language Model (LLM) to fill for the entropy gap and reproduce the alignment
ability of humans in these tasks. Our entropy-enhancing alignment is achieved
through a two-step process: 1) a new prompt template that does not rely on
explicit knowledge in the task domain is designed to use LLM to enhance the
polysemy description of the text modality. By analogy, the information entropy
of the text modality relative to the visual modality is increased; 2) A
hypergraph adapter is used to construct multilateral connections between the
text and image modalities, which can correct the positive and negative matching
errors for synonymous semantics in the same fixed embedding space, whilst
reducing the noise caused by open semantic entropy by mapping the reduced
dimensions back to the original dimensions. Comprehensive evaluations on the
Flickr30K and MS-COCO benchmarks validate the superiority of our Open Semantic
Hypergraph Adapter (OS-HGAdapter), showcasing 16.8\% (text-to-image) and 40.1\%
(image-to-text) cross-modal retrieval gains over existing methods while
establishing new state-of-the-art performance in semantic alignment tasks.

Abstract: This study investigates the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks
(3D CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for real-time American
Sign Language (ASL) recognition. Though 3D CNNs are good at spatiotemporal
feature extraction from video sequences, LSTMs are optimized for modeling
temporal dependencies in sequential data. We evaluate both architectures on a
dataset containing 1,200 ASL signs across 50 classes, comparing their accuracy,
computational efficiency, and latency under similar training conditions.
Experimental results demonstrate that 3D CNNs achieve 92.4% recognition
accuracy but require 3.2% more processing time per frame compared to LSTMs,
which maintain 86.7% accuracy with significantly lower resource consumption.
The hybrid 3D CNNLSTM model shows decent performance, which suggests that
context-dependent architecture selection is crucial for practical
implementation.This project provides professional benchmarks for developing
assistive technologies, highlighting trade-offs between recognition precision
and real-time operational requirements in edge computing environments.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在训练时多基于模拟或单一场景数据，忽略了不同地理区域噪声特性的差异，导致在新场景中性能下降。

Method: 通过字典学习编码TEM信号的固有物理特性（如指数衰减和平滑性）作为先验知识，结合自监督损失动态调整模型参数。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在TEM去噪和测试时适应任务中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DP-TTA通过利用信号的固有物理特性，显著提升了模型在新场景中的去噪性能。

Abstract: Transient Electromagnetic (TEM) method is widely used in various geophysical
applications, providing valuable insights into subsurface properties. However,
time-domain TEM signals are often submerged in various types of noise. While
recent deep learning-based denoising models have shown strong performance,
these models are mostly trained on simulated or single real-world scenario
data, overlooking the significant differences in noise characteristics from
different geographical regions. Intuitively, models trained in one environment
often struggle to perform well in new settings due to differences in geological
conditions, equipment, and external interference, leading to reduced denoising
performance. To this end, we propose the Dictionary-driven Prior Regularization
Test-time Adaptation (DP-TTA). Our key insight is that TEM signals possess
intrinsic physical characteristics, such as exponential decay and smoothness,
which remain consistent across different regions regardless of external
conditions. These intrinsic characteristics serve as ideal prior knowledge for
guiding the TTA strategy, which helps the pre-trained model dynamically adjust
parameters by utilizing self-supervised losses, improving denoising performance
in new scenarios. To implement this, we customized a network, named DTEMDNet.
Specifically, we first use dictionary learning to encode these intrinsic
characteristics as a dictionary-driven prior, which is integrated into the
model during training. At the testing stage, this prior guides the model to
adapt dynamically to new environments by minimizing self-supervised losses
derived from the dictionary-driven consistency and the signal one-order
variation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves much better performance than existing TEM denoising methods and TTA
methods.

Result: 实验显示方案在真实数据集上优于基准，采样率低至10%即可准确预测目标。

Conclusion: 方法在视图贡献和通信成本间取得优秀平衡，显著提升GS质量。

Abstract: Edge Gaussian splatting (EGS), which aggregates data from distributed clients
and trains a global GS model at the edge server, is an emerging paradigm for
scene reconstruction. Unlike traditional edge resource management methods that
emphasize communication throughput or general-purpose learning performance, EGS
explicitly aims to maximize the GS qualities, rendering existing approaches
inapplicable. To address this problem, this paper formulates a novel
GS-oriented objective function that distinguishes the heterogeneous view
contributions of different clients. However, evaluating this function in turn
requires clients' images, leading to a causality dilemma. To this end, this
paper further proposes a sample-then-transmit EGS (or STT-GS for short)
strategy, which first samples a subset of images as pilot data from each client
for loss prediction. Based on the first-stage evaluation, communication
resources are then prioritized towards more valuable clients. To achieve
efficient sampling, a feature-domain clustering (FDC) scheme is proposed to
select the most representative data and pilot transmission time minimization
(PTTM) is adopted to reduce the pilot overhead.Subsequently, we develop a joint
client selection and power control (JCSPC) framework to maximize the
GS-oriented function under communication resource constraints. Despite the
nonconvexity of the problem, we propose a low-complexity efficient solution
based on the penalty alternating majorization minimization (PAMM) algorithm.
Experiments unveil that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms existing
benchmarks on real-world datasets. It is found that the GS-oriented objective
can be accurately predicted with low sampling ratios (e.g.,10%), and our method
achieves an excellent tradeoff between view contributions and communication
costs.

Abstract: Camera-based occupancy prediction is a mainstream approach for 3D perception
in autonomous driving, aiming to infer complete 3D scene geometry and semantics
from 2D images. Almost existing methods focus on improving performance through
structural modifications, such as lightweight backbones and complex cascaded
frameworks, with good yet limited performance. Few studies explore from the
perspective of representation fusion, leaving the rich diversity of features in
2D images underutilized. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{CIGOcc, a
two-stage occupancy prediction framework based on multi-level representation
fusion. \textbf{CIGOcc extracts segmentation, graphics, and depth features from
an input image and introduces a deformable multi-level fusion mechanism to fuse
these three multi-level features. Additionally, CIGOcc incorporates knowledge
distilled from SAM to further enhance prediction accuracy. Without increasing

Abstract: The rapid growth of AI conferences is straining an already fragile
peer-review system, leading to heavy reviewer workloads, expertise mismatches,
inconsistent evaluation standards, superficial or templated reviews, and
limited accountability under compressed timelines. In response, conference
organizers have introduced new policies and interventions to preserve review
standards. Yet these ad-hoc changes often create further concerns and confusion
about the review process, leaving how papers are ultimately accepted - and how
practices evolve across years - largely opaque. We present Paper Copilot, a
system that creates durable digital archives of peer reviews across a wide
range of computer-science venues, an open dataset that enables researchers to
study peer review at scale, and a large-scale empirical analysis of ICLR
reviews spanning multiple years. By releasing both the infrastructure and the
dataset, Paper Copilot supports reproducible research on the evolution of peer
review. We hope these resources help the community track changes, diagnose
failure modes, and inform evidence-based improvements toward a more robust,
transparent, and reliable peer-review system.

Abstract: Generating stylized 3D human motion from speech signals presents substantial
challenges, primarily due to the intricate and fine-grained relationships among
speech signals, individual styles, and the corresponding body movements.
Current style encoding approaches either oversimplify stylistic diversity or
ignore regional motion style differences (e.g., upper vs. lower body), limiting
motion realism. Additionally, motion style should dynamically adapt to changes
in speech rhythm and emotion, but existing methods often overlook this. To
address these issues, we propose MimicParts, a novel framework designed to
enhance stylized motion generation based on part-aware style injection and
part-aware denoising network. It divides the body into different regions to
encode localized motion styles, enabling the model to capture fine-grained
regional differences. Furthermore, our part-aware attention block allows rhythm
and emotion cues to guide each body region precisely, ensuring that the
generated motion aligns with variations in speech rhythm and emotional state.
Experimental results show that our method outperforming existing methods
showcasing naturalness and expressive 3D human motion sequences.

Abstract: In computer vision, Visual Prompting (VP) and Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) have
recently emerged as lightweight and effective alternatives to full fine-tuning
for adapting large-scale vision models within the ``pretrain-then-finetune''
paradigm. However, despite rapid progress, their conceptual boundaries remain
blurred, as VP and VPT are frequently used interchangeably in current research,
reflecting a lack of systematic distinction between these techniques and their
respective applications. In this survey, we revisit the designs of VP and VPT
from first principles, and conceptualize them within a unified framework termed
Prompt-based Adaptation (PA). We provide a taxonomy that categorizes existing
methods into learnable, generative, and non-learnable prompts, and further
organizes them by injection granularity -- pixel-level and token-level. Beyond
the core methodologies, we examine PA's integrations across diverse domains,
including medical imaging, 3D point clouds, and vision-language tasks, as well
as its role in test-time adaptation and trustworthy AI. We also summarize
current benchmarks and identify key challenges and future directions. To the
best of our knowledge, we are the first comprehensive survey dedicated to PA's
methodologies and applications in light of their distinct characteristics. Our
survey aims to provide a clear roadmap for researchers and practitioners in all
area to understand and explore the evolving landscape of PA-related research.

Conclusion: 样本中心的多任务学习框架有效解决了工业缺陷检测中的样本级别决策稳定性问题，并通过新的评估指标验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Industrial surface defect inspection for sample-wise quality control (QC)
must simultaneously decide whether a given sample contains defects and localize
those defects spatially. In real production lines, extreme
foreground-background imbalance, defect sparsity with a long-tailed scale
distribution, and low contrast are common. As a result, pixel-centric training
and evaluation are easily dominated by large homogeneous regions, making it
difficult to drive models to attend to small or low-contrast defects-one of the
main bottlenecks for deployment. Empirically, existing models achieve strong
pixel-overlap metrics (e.g., mIoU) but exhibit insufficient stability at the
sample level, especially for sparse or slender defects. The root cause is a
mismatch between the optimization objective and the granularity of QC
decisions. To address this, we propose a sample-centric multi-task learning
framework and evaluation suite. Built on a shared-encoder architecture, the
method jointly learns sample-level defect classification and pixel-level mask
localization. Sample-level supervision modulates the feature distribution and,
at the gradient level, continually boosts recall for small and low-contrast
defects, while the segmentation branch preserves boundary and shape details to
enhance per-sample decision stability and reduce misses. For evaluation, we
propose decision-linked metrics, Seg_mIoU and Seg_Recall, which remove the bias
of classical mIoU caused by empty or true-negative samples and tightly couple
localization quality with sample-level decisions. Experiments on two benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially improves the reliability
of sample-level decisions and the completeness of defect localization.

*Inha Kang,Youngsun Lim,Seonho Lee,Jiho Choi,Junsuk Choe,Hyunjung Shim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新数据集CoVAND和轻量级模块NegToMe，解决了视觉语言模型在否定理解上的偏差问题，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在否定理解上存在严重偏差（肯定性偏差），尤其在描述性目标检测任务中表现不佳。

Method: 1. 构建CoVAND数据集，通过链式思维和VQA流程生成高质量否定数据；2. 提出NegToMe模块，通过合并否定标记与属性解决结构性问题。

Result: NegToMe显著提升了否定基准测试性能，NMS-AP在OVDEval上提升10.8分，并展示了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决现实检测任务中的否定理解问题迈出了关键一步。

Abstract: State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure
in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This
limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To
address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline
and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a
dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based
pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we
propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the
architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the
structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes
into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input
level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For
instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and
"girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning
is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated
with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method
significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a
lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval
and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step
forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection
applications.

TL;DR: UniVector是一个统一的向量提取框架，通过实例-几何交互提取多种向量类型，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常针对单一向量类型设计，无法同时处理复杂结构，受人类视觉感知启发，提出统一框架。

Method: UniVector通过结构化查询编码实例和几何信息，利用交互模块迭代更新，并引入动态形状约束优化结构。

Result: 实验表明UniVector在单结构和多结构任务中均达到最优性能。

Conclusion: UniVector通过统一框架解决了多向量类型提取问题，性能优越，代码和数据集将开源。

Abstract: Vector extraction retrieves structured vector geometry from raster images,
offering high-fidelity representation and broad applicability. Existing
methods, however, are usually tailored to a single vector type (e.g., polygons,
polylines, line segments), requiring separate models for different structures.
This stems from treating instance attributes (category, structure) and
geometric attributes (point coordinates, connections) independently, limiting
the ability to capture complex structures. Inspired by the human brain's
simultaneous use of semantic and spatial interactions in visual perception, we
propose UniVector, a unified VE framework that leverages instance-geometry
interaction to extract multiple vector types within a single model. UniVector
encodes vectors as structured queries containing both instance- and
geometry-level information, and iteratively updates them through an interaction
module for cross-level context exchange. A dynamic shape constraint further
refines global structures and key points. To benchmark multi-structure
scenarios, we introduce the Multi-Vector dataset with diverse polygons,
polylines, and line segments. Experiments show UniVector sets a new state of
the art on both single- and multi-structure VE tasks. Code and dataset will be
released at https://github.com/yyyyll0ss/UniVector.

TL;DR: EPIPTrack提出了一种多模态视觉语言跟踪框架，通过显式和隐式提示动态建模目标，提升跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖静态文本描述，缺乏实时适应性且易产生幻觉。

Method: 结合显式提示（时空信息转文本）和隐式提示（伪词与可学习描述符）动态调整目标状态，并设计特征增强器。

Result: 在MOT17、MOT20和DanceTrack上表现优于现有跟踪器。

Conclusion: EPIPTrack在多场景中展现出强适应性和优越性能。

Abstract: Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong
potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing
methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which
lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to
hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal
vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit
and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment.
Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into
natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit
prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct
individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both
prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to
changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature
Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive
experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack
outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust
adaptability and superior performance.

Motivation: VPR系统在多变环境中面临挑战，需要鲁棒的不确定性估计以支持关键应用。

Method: 提出三种度量：相似性分布（SD）、比率扩展（RS）和统计不确定性（SU），无需额外训练或验证数据。

Result: 在多个数据集和VPR方法中验证，优于现有方法，计算开销低，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: 提出的度量方法显著提升VPR匹配的精确度和召回率，适用于多变环境。

Abstract: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) enables robots and autonomous vehicles to
identify previously visited locations by matching current observations against
a database of known places. However, VPR systems face significant challenges
when deployed across varying visual environments, lighting conditions, seasonal
changes, and viewpoints changes. Failure-critical VPR applications, such as
loop closure detection in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
pipelines, require robust estimation of place matching uncertainty. We propose
three training-free uncertainty metrics that estimate prediction confidence by
analyzing inherent statistical patterns in similarity scores from any existing
VPR method. Similarity Distribution (SD) quantifies match distinctiveness by
measuring score separation between candidates; Ratio Spread (RS) evaluates
competitive ambiguity among top-scoring locations; and Statistical Uncertainty
(SU) is a combination of SD and RS that provides a unified metric that
generalizes across datasets and VPR methods without requiring validation data
to select the optimal metric. All three metrics operate without additional
model training, architectural modifications, or computationally expensive
geometric verification. Comprehensive evaluation across nine state-of-the-art
VPR methods and six benchmark datasets confirms that our metrics excel at
discriminating between correct and incorrect VPR matches, and consistently
outperform existing approaches while maintaining negligible computational
overhead, making it deployable for real-time robotic applications across varied
environmental conditions with improved precision-recall performance.

Motivation: 尽管VLA模型在机器人学习中取得了显著进展，但其对抗鲁棒性尚未充分研究。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出EDPA攻击方法，通过优化破坏视觉与文本潜在表示对齐的补丁；防御策略为对抗性微调视觉编码器。

Result: EDPA显著提高了VLA模型的任务失败率，而防御策略有效缓解了攻击带来的性能下降。

Conclusion: 论文展示了VLA模型的对抗脆弱性，并提出了有效的攻击与防御方法，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved revolutionary progress in
robot learning, enabling robots to execute complex physical robot tasks from
natural language instructions. Despite this progress, their adversarial
robustness remains underexplored. In this work, we propose both adversarial
patch attack and corresponding defense strategies for VLA models. We first
introduce the Embedding Disruption Patch Attack (EDPA), a model-agnostic
adversarial attack that generates patches directly placeable within the
camera's view. In comparison to prior methods, EDPA can be readily applied to
different VLA models without requiring prior knowledge of the model
architecture, or the controlled robotic manipulator. EDPA constructs these
patches by (i) disrupting the semantic alignment between visual and textual
latent representations, and (ii) maximizing the discrepancy of latent
representations between adversarial and corresponding clean visual inputs.
Through the optimization of these objectives, EDPA distorts the VLA's
interpretation of visual information, causing the model to repeatedly generate
incorrect actions and ultimately result in failure to complete the given
robotic task. To counter this, we propose an adversarial fine-tuning scheme for
the visual encoder, in which the encoder is optimized to produce similar latent
representations for both clean and adversarially perturbed visual inputs.
Extensive evaluations on the widely recognized LIBERO robotic simulation
benchmark demonstrate that EDPA substantially increases the task failure rate
of cutting-edge VLA models, while our proposed defense effectively mitigates
this degradation. The codebase is accessible via the homepage at

Motivation: 研究硬件加速（GPU和FPGA）在视觉SLAM中特征检测的性能和能效差异，以优化资源受限平台（如无人机）上的SLAM实现。

Method: 比较GPU和FPGA加速的FAST、Harris和SuperPoint特征检测器在Nvidia Jetson Orin和AMD Versal SoC上的运行时性能和能效。

Result: 非学习型检测器在GPU上表现更优，而学习型检测器在FPGA上能效和性能更高（分别提升3.1倍和1.4倍）。GPU加速的V-SLAM通常更准确。

Conclusion: 硬件加速可提升V-SLAM性能，非学习型检测器适合GPU，学习型检测器适合FPGA，且不影响精度。

Abstract: Feature detection is a common yet time-consuming module in Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) implementations, which are increasingly
deployed on power-constrained platforms, such as drones. Graphics Processing
Units (GPUs) have been a popular accelerator for computer vision in general,
and feature detection and SLAM in particular.
  On the other hand, System-on-Chips (SoCs) with integrated Field Programmable
Gate Array (FPGA) are also widely available. This paper presents the first
study of hardware-accelerated feature detectors considering a Visual SLAM
(V-SLAM) pipeline. We offer new insights by comparing the best GPU-accelerated
FAST, Harris, and SuperPoint implementations against the FPGA-accelerated
counterparts on modern SoCs (Nvidia Jetson Orin and AMD Versal).
  The evaluation shows that when using a non-learning-based feature detector
such as FAST and Harris, their GPU implementations, and the GPU-accelerated
V-SLAM can achieve better run-time performance and energy efficiency than the
FAST and Harris FPGA implementations as well as the FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM.
However, when considering a learning-based detector such as SuperPoint, its
FPGA implementation can achieve better run-time performance and energy
efficiency (up to 3.1$\times$ and 1.4$\times$ improvements, respectively) than
the GPU implementation. The FPGA-accelerated V-SLAM can also achieve comparable
run-time performance compared to the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM, with better FPS in
2 out of 5 dataset sequences. When considering the accuracy, the results show
that the GPU-accelerated V-SLAM is more accurate than the FPGA-accelerated
V-SLAM in general. Last but not least, the use of hardware acceleration for
feature detection could further improve the performance of the V-SLAM pipeline
by having the global bundle adjustment module invoked less frequently without
sacrificing accuracy.

Abstract: The development of computer vision algorithms for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle

large-scale datasets with accurate annotations. However, collecting and
annotating real-world UAV data is extremely challenging and costly. To address
this limitation, we present FlyAwareV2, a novel multimodal dataset encompassing
both real and synthetic UAV imagery tailored for urban scene understanding
tasks. Building upon the recently introduced SynDrone and FlyAware datasets,
FlyAwareV2 introduces several new key contributions: 1) Multimodal data (RGB,
depth, semantic labels) across diverse environmental conditions including
varying weather and daytime; 2) Depth maps for real samples computed via
state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation; 3) Benchmarks for RGB and
multimodal semantic segmentation on standard architectures; 4) Studies on
synthetic-to-real domain adaptation to assess the generalization capabilities
of models trained on the synthetic data. With its rich set of annotations and
environmental diversity, FlyAwareV2 provides a valuable resource for research
on UAV-based 3D urban scene understanding.

Conclusion: SketchSem3D和CymbaDiff为户外3D场景生成提供了标准化评估基准和高效方法。

Abstract: Outdoor 3D semantic scene generation produces realistic and semantically rich
environments for applications such as urban simulation and autonomous driving.
However, advances in this direction are constrained by the absence of publicly
available, well-annotated datasets. We introduce SketchSem3D, the first
large-scale benchmark for generating 3D outdoor semantic scenes from abstract
freehand sketches and pseudo-labeled annotations of satellite images.
SketchSem3D includes two subsets, Sketch-based SemanticKITTI and Sketch-based
KITTI-360 (containing LiDAR voxels along with their corresponding sketches and
annotated satellite images), to enable standardized, rigorous, and diverse
evaluations. We also propose Cylinder Mamba Diffusion (CymbaDiff) that
significantly enhances spatial coherence in outdoor 3D scene generation.
CymbaDiff imposes structured spatial ordering, explicitly captures cylindrical
continuity and vertical hierarchy, and preserves both physical neighborhood
relationships and global context within the generated scenes. Extensive
experiments on SketchSem3D demonstrate that CymbaDiff achieves superior
semantic consistency, spatial realism, and cross-dataset generalization. The
code and dataset will be available at

Conclusion: 该模型适用于嵌入式系统的超实时人群计数，兼具速度和准确性。

Abstract: Crowd counting is a task of estimating the number of the crowd through
images, which is extremely valuable in the fields of intelligent security,
urban planning, public safety management, and so on. However, the existing
counting methods have some problems in practical application on embedded
systems for these fields, such as excessive model parameters, abundant complex
calculations, etc. The practical application of embedded systems requires the
model to be real-time, which means that the model is fast enough. Considering
the aforementioned problems, we design a super real-time model with a
stem-encoder-decoder structure for crowd counting tasks, which achieves the
fastest inference compared with state-of-the-arts. Firstly, large convolution
kernels in the stem network are used to enlarge the receptive field, which
effectively extracts detailed head information. Then, in the encoder part, we
use conditional channel weighting and multi-branch local fusion block to merge
multi-scale features with low computational consumption. This part is crucial
to the super real-time performance of the model. Finally, the feature pyramid
networks are added to the top of the encoder to alleviate its incomplete fusion
problems. Experiments on three benchmarks show that our network is suitable for
super real-time crowd counting on embedded systems, ensuring competitive
accuracy. At the same time, the proposed network reasoning speed is the
fastest. Specifically, the proposed network achieves 381.7 FPS on NVIDIA GTX
1080Ti and 71.9 FPS on NVIDIA Jetson TX1.

Conclusion: 研究为VideoLLMs的时间推理提供了蓝图，并提出了改进模型可解释性和泛化能力的实用建议。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) extend the capabilities of
vision-language models to spatiotemporal inputs, enabling tasks such as video
question answering (VideoQA). Despite recent advances in VideoLLMs, their
internal mechanisms on where and how they extract and propagate video and
textual information remain less explored. In this study, we investigate the
internal information flow of VideoLLMs using mechanistic interpretability
techniques. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns across diverse VideoQA
tasks: (1) temporal reasoning in VideoLLMs initiates with active cross-frame
interactions in early-to-middle layers, (2) followed by progressive
video-language integration in middle layers. This is facilitated by alignment
between video representations and linguistic embeddings containing temporal
concepts. (3) Upon completion of this integration, the model is ready to
generate correct answers in middle-to-late layers. (4) Based on our analysis,
we show that VideoLLMs can retain their VideoQA performance by selecting these
effective information pathways while suppressing a substantial amount of
attention edges, e.g., 58% in LLaVA-NeXT-7B-Video-FT. These findings provide a
blueprint on how VideoLLMs perform temporal reasoning and offer practical
insights for improving model interpretability and downstream generalization.

Motivation: 现有端到端多模态模型因编码器和解码器分离而阻碍联合表示学习，MDM旨在统一多模态处理。

Method: MDM基于Mamba的多步选择扩散模型，通过统一变分自编码器逐步生成和细化模态特定信息。

Conclusion: MDM验证了统一多模态处理的有效性，为端到端多模态架构开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders
to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint
representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing,
we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM
utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively
generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational
autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM
to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data,
particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences
simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image
captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks
demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models
(MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA
models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's
effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational
efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal
architectures.

Conclusion: MMLongCite为评估LVLMs的长上下文忠实度提供了全面工具，揭示了模型的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) has led to a
significant expansion of their context windows. However, an extended context
window does not guarantee the effective utilization of the context, posing a
critical challenge for real-world applications. Current evaluations of such
long-context faithfulness are predominantly focused on the text-only domain,
while multimodal assessments remain limited to short contexts. To bridge this
gap, we introduce MMLongCite, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate
the fidelity of LVLMs in long-context scenarios. MMLongCite comprises 8
distinct tasks spanning 6 context length intervals and incorporates diverse
modalities, including text, images, and videos. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art LVLMs reveals their limited faithfulness in handling long
multimodal contexts. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis of how
context length and the position of crucial content affect the faithfulness of
these models.

TL;DR: MaskDCPT是一种新的预训练方法，通过分类和重建任务提升图像恢复性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统预训练方法在图像恢复任务中表现不足，需要更通用的表示方法。

Method: MaskDCPT结合掩码图像建模和对比学习，使用编码器和两个解码器进行分类和重建。

Result: PSNR提升3.77 dB，PIQE降低34.8%，泛化能力强。

Conclusion: MaskDCPT在图像恢复任务中表现优异，并发布了UIR-2.5M数据集。

Abstract: This study introduces a Masked Degradation Classification Pre-Training method
(MaskDCPT), designed to facilitate the classification of degradation types in
input images, leading to comprehensive image restoration pre-training. Unlike
conventional pre-training methods, MaskDCPT uses the degradation type of the
image as an extremely weak supervision, while simultaneously leveraging the
image reconstruction to enhance performance and robustness. MaskDCPT includes
an encoder and two decoders: the encoder extracts features from the masked
low-quality input image. The classification decoder uses these features to
identify the degradation type, whereas the reconstruction decoder aims to
reconstruct a corresponding high-quality image. This design allows the
pre-training to benefit from both masked image modeling and contrastive
learning, resulting in a generalized representation suited for restoration
tasks. Benefit from the straightforward yet potent MaskDCPT, the pre-trained
encoder can be used to address universal image restoration and achieve
outstanding performance. Implementing MaskDCPT significantly improves
performance for both convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, with
a minimum increase in PSNR of 3.77 dB in the 5D all-in-one restoration task and
a 34.8% reduction in PIQE compared to baseline in real-world degradation
scenarios. It also emergences strong generalization to previously unseen
degradation types and levels. In addition, we curate and release the UIR-2.5M
dataset, which includes 2.5 million paired restoration samples across 19
degradation types and over 200 degradation levels, incorporating both synthetic
and real-world data. The dataset, source code, and models are available at

image capture and preprocessing, text detection [1] using a DBNet++
(Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) detector, and text classification
[2] using a BART (Bidirectional and Auto-Regressive Transformers) classifier,
all integrated within a user interface implemented in Python with PyQt5. The
achieved results by the system for text detection in images were good at about

the proposed approach is effective for practical, mixed-source document
categorization in unconstrained imaging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于结构因果模型（SCM）的方法，用于点云分割中的新类发现（3D-NCD），通过因果表示和推理联合学习，解决了基类和新类之间的表示关联问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决点云分割中新类发现的挑战，即如何利用已标记的基类监督来分割未标记的新类，避免统计相关性学习导致的混淆。

Method: 方法包括：1）使用SCM分析基类表示中的隐藏混杂因素；2）设计因果表示原型消除混杂因素；3）通过图结构建模基类和新类之间的因果关系，实现因果推理。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在3D和2D语义分割任务中表现优越。

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on Novel Class Discovery for Point Cloud Segmentation
(3D-NCD), aiming to learn a model that can segment unlabeled (novel) 3D classes
using only the supervision from labeled (base) 3D classes. The key to this task
is to setup the exact correlations between the point representations and their
base class labels, as well as the representation correlations between the
points from base and novel classes. A coarse or statistical correlation
learning may lead to the confusion in novel class inference. lf we impose a
causal relationship as a strong correlated constraint upon the learning
process, the essential point cloud representations that accurately correspond
to the classes should be uncovered. To this end, we introduce a structural
causal model (SCM) to re-formalize the 3D-NCD problem and propose a new method,
i.e., Joint Learning of Causal Representation and Reasoning. Specifically, we
first analyze hidden confounders in the base class representations and the
causal relationships between the base and novel classes through SCM. We devise
a causal representation prototype that eliminates confounders to capture the
causal representations of base classes. A graph structure is then used to model
the causal relationships between the base classes' causal representation
prototypes and the novel class prototypes, enabling causal reasoning from base
to novel classes. Extensive experiments and visualization results on 3D and 2D
NCD semantic segmentation demonstrate the superiorities of our method.

*Jiankun Zhong,Zitong Zhan,Quankai Gao,Ziyu Chen,Haozhe Lou,Jiageng Mao,Ulrich Neumann,Yue Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于GPU并行计算的SfM方法，显著提升了大规模场景下的计算效率，同时保持了重建精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SfM方法（如COLMAP和GLOMAP）在CPU上运行效率低，且灵活性不足；而基于深度学习的SfM方法（如VGGSfM和VGGT）无法处理大规模输入视图。

Method: 利用GPU并行计算加速SfM流程中的关键步骤，结合稀疏感知的束调整优化技术，统一优化BA和GP。

Result: 在5000张图像的数据集上，比COLMAP快40倍，且重建精度相当或更高。

Conclusion: 该方法通过GPU加速解决了传统SfM的效率问题，同时避免了深度学习方法的规模限制。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM), a method that recovers camera poses and scene
geometry from uncalibrated images, is a central component in robotic
reconstruction and simulation. Despite the state-of-the-art performance of
traditional SfM methods such as COLMAP and its follow-up work, GLOMAP, naive
CPU-specialized implementations of bundle adjustment (BA) or global positioning
(GP) introduce significant computational overhead when handling large-scale
scenarios, leading to a trade-off between accuracy and speed in SfM. Moreover,
the blessing of efficient C++-based implementations in COLMAP and GLOMAP comes
with the curse of limited flexibility, as they lack support for various
external optimization options. On the other hand, while deep learning based SfM
pipelines like VGGSfM and VGGT enable feed-forward 3D reconstruction, they are
unable to scale to thousands of input views at once as GPU memory consumption
increases sharply as the number of input views grows. In this paper, we unleash
the full potential of GPU parallel computation to accelerate each critical
stage of the standard SfM pipeline. Building upon recent advances in
sparse-aware bundle adjustment optimization, our design extends these
techniques to accelerate both BA and GP within a unified global SfM framework.
Through extensive experiments on datasets of varying scales (e.g. 5000 images
where VGGSfM and VGGT run out of memory), our method demonstrates up to about
40 times speedup over COLMAP while achieving consistently comparable or even
improved reconstruction accuracy. Our project page can be found at

### [46] [Self-Augmented Visual Contrastive Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13315)
*Eun Woo Im,Muhammad Kashif Ali,Vivek Gupta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的训练自由解码策略，通过自增强提示和自适应阈值算法，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型的事实一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在视觉增强时忽略了文本查询的特定上下文，导致效果有限。

Method: 采用自增强提示策略动态对齐查询与视觉增强的语义，并设计自适应阈值算法调整候选标记大小。

Result: 在四个LVLM和七个基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有解码方法。

Conclusion: 强调了查询依赖增强和熵感知解码对提升LVLM生成效果的重要性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal
capabilities, but they inherit the tendency to hallucinate from their
underlying language models. While visual contrastive decoding has been proposed
to mitigate this issue, existing methods often apply generic visual
augmentations that disregard the specific context provided by the text query,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a novel training-free
decoding strategy that addresses these limitations, featuring two key
contributions. First, a self-augmentation prompting strategy that leverages the
intrinsic knowledge of the model to dynamically align semantics between the
query and the visual augmentation. Second, an adaptive thresholding algorithm
that adaptively adjusts next token candidate size based on the output sparsity,
utilizing full information from the logit distribution. Extensive experiments
across four LVLMs and seven benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed decoding
significantly enhances factual consistency compared to state-of-the-art
decoding methods. This work highlights the importance of integrating
query-dependent augmentation and entropy-aware decoding for improving effective
generation of LVLMs.

*Fitim Abdullahu,Helmut Grabner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型多模态模型（如GPT-4o）在视觉趣味性评估中的表现，发现其与人类评估部分一致，可用于生成训练数据以优化学习排序模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉趣味性对人类生活的影响，并探索大型多模态模型是否能捕捉这一概念及其与人类评估的一致性。

Method: 通过比较分析人类评估与GPT-4o的预测，生成图像对的趣味性标签，并用于训练学习排序模型。

Result: GPT-4o在视觉趣味性评估中表现优于现有方法，与人类评估部分一致。

Conclusion: 研究为深入理解人类兴趣提供了新途径，并展示了大型多模态模型在视觉趣味性评估中的潜力。

Abstract: Our daily life is highly influenced by what we consume and see. Attracting
and holding one's attention -- the definition of (visual) interestingness -- is
essential. The rise of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) trained on large-scale
visual and textual data has demonstrated impressive capabilities. We explore
these models' potential to understand to what extent the concepts of visual
interestingness are captured and examine the alignment between human
assessments and GPT-4o's, a leading LMM, predictions through comparative
analysis. Our studies reveal partial alignment between humans and GPT-4o. It
already captures the concept as best compared to state-of-the-art methods.
Hence, this allows for the effective labeling of image pairs according to their
(commonly) interestingness, which are used as training data to distill the
knowledge into a learning-to-rank model. The insights pave the way for a deeper
understanding of human interest.

### [48] [Removing Cost Volumes from Optical Flow Estimators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13317)
*Simon Kiefhaber,Stefan Roth,Simone Schaub-Meyer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种训练策略，允许在训练过程中移除光流估计器中的成本体积，显著提升推理速度和减少内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 成本体积在现代光流估计器中普遍使用，但其计算和空间复杂度限制了处理速度和输入帧的分辨率。实证发现，一旦其他网络部分充分训练后，成本体积的重要性降低。

Method: 引入一种训练策略，逐步移除成本体积，创建三种不同计算预算的模型。

Result: 最准确的模型达到最先进精度，速度提升1.2倍，内存占用降低6倍；最快的模型能以20FPS处理全高清帧，仅需500MB GPU内存。

Conclusion: 该训练策略有效平衡了光流估计的精度与效率，适用于不同计算预算的场景。

Abstract: Cost volumes are used in every modern optical flow estimator, but due to
their computational and space complexity, they are often a limiting factor
regarding both processing speed and the resolution of input frames. Motivated
by our empirical observation that cost volumes lose their importance once all
other network parts of, e.g., a RAFT-based pipeline have been sufficiently
trained, we introduce a training strategy that allows removing the cost volume
from optical flow estimators throughout training. This leads to significantly
improved inference speed and reduced memory requirements. Using our training
strategy, we create three different models covering different compute budgets.
Our most accurate model reaches state-of-the-art accuracy while being
$1.2\times$ faster and having a $6\times$ lower memory footprint than
comparable models; our fastest model is capable of processing Full HD frames at
$20\,\mathrm{FPS}$ using only $500\,\mathrm{MB}$ of GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于热成像的隐蔽武器检测方法DEF-YOLO，并发布了首个大规模数据集TICW，通过改进YOLOv8和引入焦点损失，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成像技术（如毫米波、微波等）在隐蔽武器检测中存在分辨率低或隐私问题，热成像提供了一种低成本、实时且保护隐私的解决方案。

Method: 改进YOLOv8，引入可变形卷积和焦点损失，构建DEF-YOLO模型，并发布TICW数据集。

Result: DEF-YOLO在热成像隐蔽武器检测中表现优异，建立了新的性能基准。

Conclusion: 热成像结合DEF-YOLO是一种高效、隐私友好的隐蔽武器检测方案，TICW数据集填补了该领域的数据空白。

Abstract: Concealed weapon detection aims at detecting weapons hidden beneath a
person's clothing or luggage. Various imaging modalities like Millimeter Wave,
Microwave, Terahertz, Infrared, etc., are exploited for the concealed weapon
detection task. These imaging modalities have their own limitations, such as
poor resolution in microwave imaging, privacy concerns in millimeter wave
imaging, etc. To provide a real-time, 24 x 7 surveillance, low-cost, and
privacy-preserved solution, we opted for thermal imaging in spite of the lack
of availability of a benchmark dataset. We propose a novel approach and a
dataset for concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery. Our YOLO-based
architecture, DEF-YOLO, is built with key enhancements in YOLOv8 tailored to
the unique challenges of concealed weapon detection in thermal vision. We adopt
deformable convolutions at the SPPF layer to exploit multi-scale features;
backbone and neck layers to extract low, mid, and high-level features, enabling
DEF-YOLO to adaptively focus on localization around the objects in thermal
homogeneous regions, without sacrificing much of the speed and throughput. In
addition to these simple yet effective key architectural changes, we introduce
a new, large-scale Thermal Imaging Concealed Weapon dataset, TICW, featuring a
diverse set of concealed weapons and capturing a wide range of scenarios. To
the best of our knowledge, this is the first large-scale contributed dataset
for this task. We also incorporate focal loss to address the significant class
imbalance inherent in the concealed weapon detection task. The efficacy of the
proposed work establishes a new benchmark through extensive experimentation for
concealed weapon detection in thermal imagery.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Group-VQ通过分组优化码本，提升重建性能与码本利用率，并引入训练后码本重采样方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VQ-VAEs中码本崩溃问题，现有方法限制码本学习能力，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出Group-VQ，分组独立优化码本，组内联合优化；引入训练后码本重采样方法。

Result: 实验显示Group-VQ在重建指标上表现更优，码本重采样方法灵活调整码本大小。

Conclusion: Group-VQ有效平衡码本利用与重建性能，训练后调整码本大小的方法具有实用性。

Abstract: Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) leverage self-supervised
learning through reconstruction tasks to represent continuous vectors using the
closest vectors in a codebook. However, issues such as codebook collapse
persist in the VQ model. To address these issues, existing approaches employ
implicit static codebooks or jointly optimize the entire codebook, but these
methods constrain the codebook's learning capability, leading to reduced
reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose Group-VQ, which performs
group-wise optimization on the codebook. Each group is optimized independently,
with joint optimization performed within groups. This approach improves the
trade-off between codebook utilization and reconstruction performance.
Additionally, we introduce a training-free codebook resampling method, allowing
post-training adjustment of the codebook size. In image reconstruction
experiments under various settings, Group-VQ demonstrates improved performance
on reconstruction metrics. And the post-training codebook sampling method
achieves the desired flexibility in adjusting the codebook size.

*Sipeng Yang,Jiayu Ji,Qingchuan Zhu,Zhiyao Yang,Xiaogang Jin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对渲染视频的无参考质量评估（NR-VQA）方法和数据集，解决了现有方法在渲染视频上的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 渲染视频与相机拍摄视频存在差异，现有NR-VQA方法直接应用于渲染视频会导致预测偏差。

Method: 构建了一个包含多种3D场景和渲染设置的渲染视频数据集，并设计了一种结合图像质量和时间稳定性的NR-VQA指标。

Result: 提出的指标在渲染视频上表现优于现有NR-VQA方法，并能用于评估超采样方法和实时渲染中的帧生成策略。

Conclusion: 该方法为渲染视频的质量评估提供了更准确的工具，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Quality assessment of videos is crucial for many computer graphics
applications, including video games, virtual reality, and augmented reality,
where visual performance has a significant impact on user experience. When test
videos cannot be perfectly aligned with references or when references are
unavailable, the significance of no-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA)
methods is undeniable. However, existing NR-VQA datasets and metrics are
primarily focused on camera-captured videos; applying them directly to rendered
videos would result in biased predictions, as rendered videos are more prone to
temporal artifacts. To address this, we present a large rendering-oriented
video dataset with subjective quality annotations, as well as a designed NR-VQA
metric specific to rendered videos. The proposed dataset includes a wide range
of 3D scenes and rendering settings, with quality scores annotated for various
display types to better reflect real-world application scenarios. Building on
this dataset, we calibrate our NR-VQA metric to assess rendered video quality
by looking at both image quality and temporal stability. We compare our metric
to existing NR-VQA metrics, demonstrating its superior performance on rendered
videos. Finally, we demonstrate that our metric can be used to benchmark
supersampling methods and assess frame generation strategies in real-time
rendering.

*MingZe Tang,Jubal Chandy Jacob*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，在视觉语言模型（VLMs）的零样本分类中，简单提示比详细提示效果更好，尤其是高性能模型如MetaCLIP 2和OpenCLIP。低性能模型SigLip则相反。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨提示设计对视觉相似类别（如人体姿势）分类的影响，尤其是在数据稀缺条件下。

Method: 使用285张COCO数据集图像，评估OpenCLIP、MetaCLIP 2和SigLip模型在不同详细程度的提示下的表现。

Result: 高性能模型在简单提示下表现最佳，详细提示会显著降低准确率（如MetaCLIP 2从68.8%降至55.1%）。低性能模型SigLip在详细提示下表现更好。

Conclusion: 提示设计对VLM性能有显著影响，简单提示更适合高性能模型，而低性能模型可能需要更详细的提示。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared space, a promising approach for
data-scarce conditions. However, the influence of prompt design on recognizing
visually similar categories, such as human postures, is not well understood.
This study investigates how prompt specificity affects the zero-shot
classification of sitting, standing, and walking/running on a small, 285-image
COCO-derived dataset. A suite of modern VLMs, including OpenCLIP, MetaCLIP 2,
and SigLip, were evaluated using a three-tiered prompt design that
systematically increases linguistic detail. Our findings reveal a compelling,
counter-intuitive trend: for the highest-performing models (MetaCLIP 2 and
OpenCLIP), the simplest, most basic prompts consistently achieve the best
results. Adding descriptive detail significantly degrades performance for
instance, MetaCLIP 2's multi-class accuracy drops from 68.8\% to 55.1\% a
phenomenon we term "prompt overfitting". Conversely, the lower-performing
SigLip model shows improved classification on ambiguous classes when given more
descriptive, body-cue-based prompts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepthVLA通过引入预训练的深度预测模块，显著提升了Vision-Language-Action模型的空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在需要精确空间推理的任务中表现不佳，主要因为其空间推理能力有限且依赖大量动作数据预训练。

Method: DepthVLA采用混合Transformer设计，结合VLM、深度Transformer和动作专家模块，通过共享注意力实现端到端训练。

Result: DepthVLA在真实世界和模拟环境中均优于现有方法，如真实世界任务中78.5% vs. 65.0%的提升。

Conclusion: DepthVLA通过显式空间感知模块有效解决了VLA模型的空间推理问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently shown impressive
generalization and language-guided manipulation capabilities. However, their
performance degrades on tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning due to
limited spatial reasoning inherited from Vision-Language Models (VLMs).
Existing VLAs rely on extensive action-data pretraining to ground VLMs in 3D
space, which reduces training efficiency and is still insufficient for accurate
spatial understanding. In this work, we present DepthVLA, a simple yet
effective VLA architecture that explicitly incorporates spatial awareness
through a pretrained depth prediction module. DepthVLA adopts a
mixture-of-transformers design that unifies a VLM, a depth transformer, and an
action expert with fully shared attentions, forming an end-to-end model with
enhanced spatial reasoning. Extensive evaluations in both real-world and
simulated environments show that DepthVLA outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 78.5% vs. 65.0% progress in real-world tasks, 94.9% vs.
93.6% in the LIBERO simulator, and 74.8% vs. 58.8% in the Simpler simulator.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合SDF和3DGS的新方法，用于动态场景渲染和重建，无需LiDAR数据即可实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于3DGS的方法需要LiDAR数据和3D分割标注，限制了应用范围。

Method: 结合SDF和3DGS，利用深度和点跟踪的2D先验，优化几何精度和变形建模。

Result: 在无LiDAR数据时表现优异，加入LiDAR后进一步提升重建和视图生成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态场景中实现了高性能渲染和编辑，无需复杂标注。

Abstract: Dynamic scene rendering and reconstruction play a crucial role in computer
vision and augmented reality. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), have enabled accurate modeling of dynamic urban scenes, but for urban
scenes they require both camera and LiDAR data, ground-truth 3D segmentations
and motion data in the form of tracklets or pre-defined object templates such
as SMPL. In this work, we explore whether a combination of 2D object agnostic
priors in the form of depth and point tracking coupled with a signed distance
function (SDF) representation for dynamic objects can be used to relax some of
these requirements. We present a novel approach that integrates Signed Distance
Functions (SDFs) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to create a more robust
object representation by harnessing the strengths of both methods. Our unified
optimization framework enhances the geometric accuracy of 3D Gaussian splatting
and improves deformation modeling within the SDF, resulting in a more adaptable
and precise representation. We demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in rendering metrics even without LiDAR data on
urban scenes. When incorporating LiDAR, our approach improved further in
reconstructing and generating novel views across diverse object categories,
without ground-truth 3D motion annotation. Additionally, our method enables
various scene editing tasks, including scene decomposition, and scene
composition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GLSDA的新框架，利用预训练大模型的语义先验增强WiFi手势识别的泛化能力和语义表达。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有WiFi手势识别方法因CSI的领域敏感性和缺乏高级手势抽象而泛化能力有限。

Method: 设计了双路径CSI编码管道，结合多尺度语义编码器和语义感知软监督方案，并通过鲁棒双蒸馏策略压缩模型。

Result: 在Widar3.0基准测试中，GLSDA在域内和跨域任务中均优于现有方法，同时显著减小模型规模和推理延迟。

Conclusion: GLSDA为实际AIoT应用提供了可扩展且可部署的通用RF手势接口解决方案。

Abstract: WiFi-based gesture recognition has emerged as a promising RF sensing paradigm
for enabling non-contact and privacy-preserving human-computer interaction in
AIoT environments. However, existing methods often suffer from limited
generalization and semantic expressiveness due to the domain-sensitive nature
of Channel State Information and the lack of high-level gesture abstraction. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel generalization framework, termed
Large-Model-Aware Semantic Distillation and Alignment (GLSDA), which leverages
the semantic prior of pre-trained large foundation models to enhance gesture
representation learning in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.
Specifically, we first design a dual-path CSI encoding pipeline that captures
geometric and dynamic gesture patterns via CSI-Ratio phase sequences and
Doppler spectrograms. These representations are then fed into a Multiscale
Semantic Encoder, which learns robust temporal embeddings and aligns them with
gesture semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. To further enhance
category discrimination, we introduce a Semantic-Aware Soft Supervision scheme
that encodes inter-class correlations and reduces label ambiguity, especially
for semantically similar gestures. Finally, we develop a Robust
Dual-Distillation strategy to compress the aligned model into a lightweight
student network, jointly distilling intermediate features and semantic-informed
soft labels from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the Widar3.0
benchmark show that GLSDA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
both in-domain and cross-domain gesture recognition tasks, while significantly
reducing model size and inference latency. Our method offers a scalable and
deployable solution for generalized RF-based gesture interfaces in real-world
AIoT applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于认知分类的统一基准Spatial-DISE，用于评估视觉语言模型的空间推理能力，并生成了大规模数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法充分评估空间推理能力，尤其是内在动态空间推理，这是人类空间认知的基础。

Method: 开发了一个可扩展的自动化流程，生成多样且可验证的空间推理问题，构建了Spatial-DISE数据集。

Result: 评估了28个先进视觉语言模型，发现它们与人类能力存在显著差距，尤其是在多步多视角空间推理任务上。

Conclusion: Spatial-DISE为未来研究提供了框架、数据集和方向，推动实现类人空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning ability is crucial for Vision Language Models (VLMs) to
support real-world applications in diverse domains including robotics,
augmented reality, and autonomous navigation. Unfortunately, existing
benchmarks are inadequate in assessing spatial reasoning ability, especially
the \emph{intrinsic-dynamic} spatial reasoning which is a fundamental aspect of
human spatial cognition. In this paper, we propose a unified benchmark,
\textbf{Spatial-DISE}, based on a cognitively grounded taxonomy that
categorizes tasks into four fundamental quadrants:
\textbf{I}ntrinsic-\textbf{S}tatic, Intrinsic-\textbf{D}ynamic,
\textbf{E}xtrinsic-Static, and Extrinsic-Dynamic spatial reasoning. Moreover,
to address the issue of data scarcity, we develop a scalable and automated
pipeline to generate diverse and verifiable spatial reasoning questions,
resulting in a new \textbf{Spatial-DISE} dataset that includes Spatial-DISE
Bench (559 evaluation VQA pairs) and Spatial-DISE-12K (12K+ training VQA
pairs). Our comprehensive evaluation across 28 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals
that, current VLMs have a large and consistent gap to human competence,
especially on multi-step multi-view spatial reasoning. Spatial-DISE offers a
robust framework, valuable dataset, and clear direction for future research
toward human-like spatial intelligence. Benchmark, dataset, and code will be
publicly released.

Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要针对扩散模型或自回归模型，忽视了掩码生成模型这一重要范式。

Method: 提出Mask-GRPO，将GRPO强化学习融入掩码生成模型，重新定义转移概率，并将解掩过程建模为多步决策问题。

Result: 在标准T2I基准测试和偏好对齐任务中，Mask-GRPO显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mask-GRPO为掩码生成模型提供了有效的强化学习框架，展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in
text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are
tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an
important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose
Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine
the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and
formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To
further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including
removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out
low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with
substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment,
outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on

high-resolution text-guided image inpainting. Unlike existing methods limited
to lower resolutions, our approach achieves 4K+ resolution while maintaining
precise content consistency and prompt alignment, two critical challenges in
image inpainting that intensify with increasing resolution and texture
complexity. Patch-Adapter leverages a two-stage adapter architecture to scale
the diffusion model's resolution from 1K to 4K+ without requiring structural
overhauls: (1) Dual Context Adapter learns coherence between masked and
unmasked regions at reduced resolutions to establish global structural
consistency; and (2) Reference Patch Adapter implements a patch-level attention
mechanism for full-resolution inpainting, preserving local detail fidelity
through adaptive feature fusion. This dual-stage architecture uniquely
addresses the scalability gap in high-resolution inpainting by decoupling
global semantics from localized refinement. Experiments demonstrate that
Patch-Adapter not only resolves artifacts common in large-scale inpainting but
also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the OpenImages and
Photo-Concept-Bucket datasets, outperforming existing methods in both
perceptual quality and text-prompt adherence.

*Yushan Han,Hui Zhang,Honglei Zhang,Chuntao Ding,Yuanzhouhan Cao,Yidong Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoDS提出了一种协作感知方法，通过域分离解决异构场景中的特征差异问题，实现了检测精度与推理效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知方法假设所有代理使用相同编码器，但在实际异构场景中不成立，且特征对齐易受噪声影响，推理效率低。

Method: CoDS采用轻量级空间-通道调整器（LSCR）和域分离分布对齐（DADS）模块，结合DAMI损失进行特征对齐和域分离。

Result: 实验表明，CoDS有效缓解了异构场景中的特征差异，并在检测精度和推理效率之间取得了平衡。

Conclusion: CoDS为异构场景中的协作感知提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative perception has been proven to improve individual perception in
autonomous driving through multi-agent interaction. Nevertheless, most methods
often assume identical encoders for all agents, which does not hold true when
these models are deployed in real-world applications. To realize collaborative
perception in actual heterogeneous scenarios, existing methods usually align
neighbor features to those of the ego vehicle, which is vulnerable to noise
from domain gaps and thus fails to address feature discrepancies effectively.
Moreover, they adopt transformer-based modules for domain adaptation, which
causes the model inference inefficiency on mobile devices. To tackle these
issues, we propose CoDS, a Collaborative perception method that leverages
Domain Separation to address feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios.
The CoDS employs two feature alignment modules, i.e., Lightweight
Spatial-Channel Resizer (LSCR) and Distribution Alignment via Domain Separation
(DADS). Besides, it utilizes the Domain Alignment Mutual Information (DAMI)
loss to ensure effective feature alignment. Specifically, the LSCR aligns the
neighbor feature across spatial and channel dimensions using a lightweight
convolutional layer. Subsequently, the DADS mitigates feature distribution
discrepancy with encoder-specific and encoder-agnostic domain separation
modules. The former removes domain-dependent information and the latter
captures task-related information. During training, the DAMI loss maximizes the
mutual information between aligned heterogeneous features to enhance the domain
separation process. The CoDS employs a fully convolutional architecture, which
ensures high inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
CoDS effectively mitigates feature discrepancies in heterogeneous scenarios and
achieves a trade-off between detection accuracy and inference efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 当前方法主要在2D像素上操作，难以分离对物理场景属性的选择性。

Method: 使用径向基函数参数化网格变形，学习偏移和尺度以最大化神经元响应，同时保持几何规则性。

Result: 应用于猴子V4区模型，能够探测神经元对可解释3D因素（如姿态和光照）的选择性。

Conclusion: 该方法将逆向图形与系统神经科学结合，提供了一种超越传统像素方法的3D刺激研究途径。

Abstract: Visual perception relies on inference of 3D scene properties such as shape,
pose, and lighting. To understand how visual sensory neurons enable robust
perception, it is crucial to characterize their selectivity to such physically
interpretable factors. However, current approaches mainly operate on 2D pixels,
making it difficult to isolate selectivity for physical scene properties. To
address this limitation, we introduce a differentiable rendering pipeline that
optimizes deformable meshes to obtain MEIs directly in 3D. The method
parameterizes mesh deformations with radial basis functions and learns offsets
and scales that maximize neuronal responses while enforcing geometric
regularity. Applied to models of monkey area V4, our approach enables probing
neuronal selectivity to interpretable 3D factors such as pose and lighting.
This approach bridges inverse graphics with systems neuroscience, offering a
way to probe neural selectivity with physically grounded, 3D stimuli beyond
conventional pixel-based methods.

Motivation: 探索NIR-HSI在食品质量分析中的潜力，尤其是通过CNNs和PLS的结合提升分析效果。

Method: 通过四项研究，比较CNNs和PLS在空间和光谱分析中的表现，并开发了新的算法和工具包。

Result: CNNs在结合空间和光谱信息时表现更优，而PLS在分析化学参数均值时效果相当。开发的两个工具包提升了建模和交叉验证的效率。

Conclusion: NIR-HSI结合CNNs和PLS在食品质量分析中具有潜力，但数据质量对结果影响显著。开源工具包为相关研究提供了便利。

Abstract: This thesis investigates the application of near-infrared hyperspectral
imaging (NIR-HSI) for food quality analysis. The investigation is conducted
through four studies operating with five research hypotheses. For several
analyses, the studies compare models based on convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) and partial least squares (PLS). Generally, joint spatio-spectral
analysis with CNNs outperforms spatial analysis with CNNs and spectral analysis
with PLS when modeling parameters where chemical and physical visual
information are relevant. When modeling chemical parameters with a
2-dimensional (2D) CNN, augmenting the CNN with an initial layer dedicated to
performing spectral convolution enhances its predictive performance by learning
a spectral preprocessing similar to that applied by domain experts. Still,
PLS-based spectral modeling performs equally well for analysis of the mean
content of chemical parameters in samples and is the recommended approach.
Modeling the spatial distribution of chemical parameters with NIR-HSI is
limited by the ability to obtain spatially resolved reference values.
Therefore, a study used bulk mean references for chemical map generation of fat
content in pork bellies. A PLS-based approach gave non-smooth chemical maps and
pixel-wise predictions outside the range of 0-100\%. Conversely, a 2D CNN
augmented with a spectral convolution layer mitigated all issues arising with
PLS. The final study attempted to model barley's germinative capacity by
analyzing NIR spectra, RGB images, and NIR-HSI images. However, the results
were inconclusive due to the dataset's low degree of germination. Additionally,
this thesis has led to the development of two open-sourced Python packages. The
first facilitates fast PLS-based modeling, while the second facilitates very
fast cross-validation of PLS and other classical machine learning models with a
new algorithm.

Method: 通过模型拼接将文本到视频生成器与3D解码器结合，并使用直接奖励微调对齐生成器与解码器。

Result: VIST3A显著优于现有文本到3D模型，并能生成高质量文本到点云图。

Conclusion: VIST3A为文本到3D生成提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid progress of large, pretrained models for both visual content
generation and 3D reconstruction opens up new possibilities for text-to-3D
generation. Intuitively, one could obtain a formidable 3D scene generator if
one were able to combine the power of a modern latent text-to-video model as
"generator" with the geometric abilities of a recent (feedforward) 3D
reconstruction system as "decoder". We introduce VIST3A, a general framework
that does just that, addressing two main challenges. First, the two components
must be joined in a way that preserves the rich knowledge encoded in their
weights. We revisit model stitching, i.e., we identify the layer in the 3D
decoder that best matches the latent representation produced by the
text-to-video generator and stitch the two parts together. That operation
requires only a small dataset and no labels. Second, the text-to-video
generator must be aligned with the stitched 3D decoder, to ensure that the
generated latents are decodable into consistent, perceptually convincing 3D
scene geometry. To that end, we adapt direct reward finetuning, a popular
technique for human preference alignment. We evaluate the proposed VIST3A
approach with different video generators and 3D reconstruction models. All
tested pairings markedly improve over prior text-to-3D models that output
Gaussian splats. Moreover, by choosing a suitable 3D base model, VIST3A also
enables high-quality text-to-pointmap generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中面部情绪识别（FER）因多种因素（如头部位置变化、遮挡、光照变化等）而困难，现有模型在参与度检测等应用中表现不佳。

Method: 结合CNN和MoE框架，动态选择专家网络，多尺度特征提取全局和局部特征，使用残差网络进行深度特征学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异（如AffectNet v7 74.77%，RAF-DB 84.29%），优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ExpressNet-MoE具有适应性和实用性，适用于实际场景的情绪识别系统。

Abstract: In many domains, including online education, healthcare, security, and
human-computer interaction, facial emotion recognition (FER) is essential.
Real-world FER is still difficult despite its significance because of some
factors such as variable head positions, occlusions, illumination shifts, and
demographic diversity. Engagement detection, which is essential for
applications like virtual learning and customer services, is frequently
challenging due to FER limitations by many current models. In this article, we
propose ExpressNet-MoE, a novel hybrid deep learning model that blends both
Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, to
overcome the difficulties. Our model dynamically chooses the most pertinent
expert networks, thus it aids in the generalization and providing flexibility
to model across a wide variety of datasets. Our model improves on the accuracy
of emotion recognition by utilizing multi-scale feature extraction to collect
both global and local facial features. ExpressNet-MoE includes numerous
CNN-based feature extractors, a MoE module for adaptive feature selection, and
finally a residual network backbone for deep feature learning. To demonstrate
efficacy of our proposed model we evaluated on several datasets, and compared
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our model achieves accuracies of 74.77%
on AffectNet (v7), 72.55% on AffectNet (v8), 84.29% on RAF-DB, and 64.66% on
FER-2013. The results show how adaptive our model is and how it may be used to
develop end-to-end emotion recognition systems in practical settings.

Result: 在MMEB基准和多个检索任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: UniME-V2通过MLLM增强的语义匹配和优化策略显著提升了多模态嵌入模型的判别能力和性能。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models are foundational to various tasks.
Existing approaches typically employ in-batch negative mining by measuring the
similarity of query-candidate pairs. However, these methods often struggle to
capture subtle semantic differences among candidates and lack diversity in
negative samples. Moreover, the embeddings exhibit limited discriminative
ability in distinguishing false and hard negatives. In this paper, we leverage
the advanced understanding capabilities of MLLMs to enhance representation
learning and present a novel Universal Multimodal Embedding (UniME-V2) model.
Our approach first constructs a potential hard negative set through global
retrieval. We then introduce the MLLM-as-a-Judge mechanism, which utilizes
MLLMs to assess the semantic alignment of query-candidate pairs and generate
soft semantic matching scores. These scores serve as a foundation for hard
negative mining, mitigating the impact of false negatives and enabling the
identification of diverse, high-quality hard negatives. Furthermore, the
semantic matching scores are used as soft labels to mitigate the rigid
one-to-one mapping constraint. By aligning the similarity matrix with the soft
semantic matching score matrix, the model learns semantic distinctions among
candidates, significantly enhancing its discriminative capacity. To further
improve performance, we propose UniME-V2-Reranker, a reranking model trained on
our mined hard negatives through a joint pairwise and listwise optimization
approach. We conduct comprehensive experiments on the MMEB benchmark and
multiple retrieval tasks, demonstrating that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance on average across all tasks.

Motivation: 增量学习过程中容易因任务间的瞬态特征导致灾难性遗忘，尤其是在复杂情绪识别任务中。

Result: 在CFEE数据集上，增量学习复杂情绪的准确率达到0.75，模型轻量且内存占用小。

Conclusion: 动作单元作为特征能有效支持增量学习，在复杂情绪识别中表现优异。

Abstract: Incremental learning is a complex process due to potential catastrophic
forgetting of old tasks when learning new ones. This is mainly due to transient
features that do not fit from task to task. In this paper, we focus on complex
emotion recognition. First, we learn basic emotions and then, incrementally,
like humans, complex emotions. We show that Action Units, describing facial
muscle movements, are non-transient, highly semantical features that outperform
those extracted by both shallow and deep convolutional neural networks. Thanks
to this ability, our approach achieves interesting results when learning
incrementally complex, compound emotions with an accuracy of 0.75 on the CFEE
dataset and can be favorably compared to state-of-the-art results. Moreover, it
results in a lightweight model with a small memory footprint.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于神经参数化3D乳房形状模型的低成本、可访问的3D表面重建方法，仅需单目RGB视频即可实现高精度重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有商业3D乳房扫描解决方案成本高昂，且现有低成本替代方案需要专用硬件或软件。本文旨在提供一种无需专用设备、仅需普通RGB视频的低成本高精度重建方法。

Method: 结合现成的Structure-from-motion流程和参数化乳房模型，提出局部化隐式神经网络表示（liRBSM），通过分解乳房区域为多个局部神经SDF提升重建质量。

Result: liRBSM显著优于全局隐式模型（iRBSM），重建误差小于2毫米，且处理时间少于6分钟。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、透明、开源，适用于普通设备，为低成本高精度3D乳房重建提供了可行方案。

Abstract: We present a neural parametric 3D breast shape model and, based on this
model, introduce a low-cost and accessible 3D surface reconstruction pipeline
capable of recovering accurate breast geometry from a monocular RGB video. In
contrast to widely used, commercially available yet prohibitively expensive 3D
breast scanning solutions and existing low-cost alternatives, our method
requires neither specialized hardware nor proprietary software and can be used
with any device that is able to record RGB videos. The key building blocks of
our pipeline are a state-of-the-art, off-the-shelf Structure-from-motion
pipeline, paired with a parametric breast model for robust and metrically
correct surface reconstruction. Our model, similarly to the recently proposed
implicit Regensburg Breast Shape Model (iRBSM), leverages implicit neural
representations to model breast shapes. However, unlike the iRBSM, which
employs a single global neural signed distance function (SDF), our approach --
inspired by recent state-of-the-art face models -- decomposes the implicit
breast domain into multiple smaller regions, each represented by a local neural
SDF anchored at anatomical landmark positions. When incorporated into our
surface reconstruction pipeline, the proposed model, dubbed liRBSM (short for
localized iRBSM), significantly outperforms the iRBSM in terms of
reconstruction quality, yielding more detailed surface reconstruction than its
global counterpart. Overall, we find that the introduced pipeline is able to
recover high-quality 3D breast geometry within an error margin of less than 2
mm. Our method is fast (requires less than six minutes), fully transparent and
open-source, and -- together with the model -- publicly available at
https://rbsm.re-mic.de/local-implicit.

Method: 使用基于CLIP特征空间的轻量级残差适配器，代理在5x5网格上移动和交互，环境提供按sigma调度的模糊输入。

Result: 结果显示不同文化群体（亚洲和西方）在模糊条件下的性能退化曲线不对称，混合群体表现介于两者之间。

Conclusion: 文化组成和交互结构会影响面部表情识别在感知条件退化时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) must remain robust under both cultural
variation and perceptually degraded visual conditions, yet most existing
evaluations assume homogeneous data and high-quality imagery. We introduce an
agent-based, streaming benchmark that reveals how cross-cultural composition
and progressive blurring interact to shape face recognition robustness. Each
agent operates in a frozen CLIP feature space with a lightweight residual
adapter trained online at sigma=0 and fixed during testing. Agents move and
interact on a 5x5 lattice, while the environment provides inputs with
sigma-scheduled Gaussian blur. We examine monocultural populations
(Western-only, Asian-only) and mixed environments with balanced (5/5) and
imbalanced (8/2, 2/8) compositions, as well as different spatial contact
structures. Results show clear asymmetric degradation curves between cultural
groups: JAFFE (Asian) populations maintain higher performance at low blur but
exhibit sharper drops at intermediate stages, whereas KDEF (Western)
populations degrade more uniformly. Mixed populations exhibit intermediate
patterns, with balanced mixtures mitigating early degradation, but imbalanced
settings amplify majority-group weaknesses under high blur. These findings
quantify how cultural composition and interaction structure influence the
robustness of FER as perceptual conditions deteriorate.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and
infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by
advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality
dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world
complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a
high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes
from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time
variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR
image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable
high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse
conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion
(PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated
condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF
effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal
contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A
prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in
practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal
the effectiveness of PCDF.

Motivation: 现有异常识别方法主要依赖视觉数据，在遮挡、低光照等条件下不可靠，且缺乏大规模同步音频-视觉数据集。

Method: AVAR-Net结合音频特征提取器（Wav2Vec2）、视频特征提取器（MobileViT）、早期融合机制和多阶段时序卷积网络（MTCN）。

Result: 在VAAR数据集上达到89.29%准确率，在XD-Violence数据集上AP提升2.8%。

Conclusion: AVAR-Net展示了多模态异常识别的有效性，VAAR数据集为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Anomaly recognition plays a vital role in surveillance, transportation,
healthcare, and public safety. However, most existing approaches rely solely on
visual data, making them unreliable under challenging conditions such as
occlusion, low illumination, and adverse weather. Moreover, the absence of
large-scale synchronized audio-visual datasets has hindered progress in
multimodal anomaly recognition. To address these limitations, this study
presents AVAR-Net, a lightweight and efficient audio-visual anomaly recognition
framework designed for real-world environments. AVAR-Net consists of four main
modules: an audio feature extractor, a video feature extractor, fusion
strategy, and a sequential pattern learning network that models cross-modal
relationships for anomaly recognition. Specifically, the Wav2Vec2 model
extracts robust temporal features from raw audio, while MobileViT captures both
local and global visual representations from video frames. An early fusion
mechanism combines these modalities, and a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional
Network (MTCN) model that learns long-range temporal dependencies within the
fused representation, enabling robust spatiotemporal reasoning. A novel
Visual-Audio Anomaly Recognition (VAAR) dataset, is also introduced, serving as
a medium-scale benchmark containing 3,000 real-world videos with synchronized
audio across ten diverse anomaly classes. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
that AVAR-Net achieves 89.29% accuracy on VAAR and 88.56% Average Precision on
the XD-Violence dataset, improving Average Precision by 2.8% over existing
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness,
efficiency, and generalization capability of the proposed framework, as well as
the utility of VAAR as a benchmark for advancing multimodal anomaly recognition
research.

Abstract: Medical image enhancement is crucial for improving the quality and
interpretability of diagnostic images, ultimately supporting early detection,
accurate diagnosis, and effective treatment planning. Despite advancements in
imaging technologies such as X-ray, CT, MRI, and ultrasound, medical images
often suffer from challenges like noise, artifacts, and low contrast, which
limit their diagnostic potential. Addressing these challenges requires robust
preprocessing, denoising algorithms, and advanced enhancement methods, with
deep learning techniques playing an increasingly significant role. This
systematic literature review, following the PRISMA approach, investigates the
key challenges, recent advancements, and evaluation metrics in medical image
enhancement. By analyzing findings from 39 peer-reviewed studies, this review
provides insights into the effectiveness of various enhancement methods across
different imaging modalities and the importance of evaluation metrics in
assessing their impact. Key issues like low contrast and noise are identified
as the most frequent, with MRI and multi-modal imaging receiving the most
attention, while specialized modalities such as histopathology, endoscopy, and
bone scintigraphy remain underexplored. Out of the 39 studies, 29 utilize
conventional mathematical methods, 9 focus on deep learning techniques, and 1
explores a hybrid approach. In terms of image quality assessment, 18 studies
employ both reference-based and non-reference-based metrics, 9 rely solely on
reference-based metrics, and 12 use only non-reference-based metrics, with a
total of 65 IQA metrics introduced, predominantly non-reference-based. This
review highlights current limitations, research gaps, and potential future
directions for advancing medical image enhancement.

Abstract: Foundation models such as DINOv2 have shown strong performance in few-shot
anomaly detection, yet two key questions remain unexamined: (i) how susceptible
are these detectors to adversarial perturbations; and (ii) how well do their
anomaly scores reflect calibrated uncertainty? Building on AnomalyDINO, a
training-free deep nearest-neighbor detector over DINOv2 features, we present
one of the first systematic studies of adversarial attacks and uncertainty
estimation in this setting. To enable white-box gradient attacks while
preserving test-time behavior, we attach a lightweight linear head to frozen
DINOv2 features only for crafting perturbations. Using this heuristic, we
evaluate the impact of FGSM across the MVTec-AD and VisA datasets and observe
consistent drops in F1, AUROC, AP, and G-mean, indicating that imperceptible
perturbations can flip nearest-neighbor relations in feature space to induce
confident misclassification. Complementing robustness, we probe reliability and
find that raw anomaly scores are poorly calibrated, revealing a gap between
confidence and correctness that limits safety-critical use. As a simple, strong
baseline toward trustworthiness, we apply post-hoc Platt scaling to the anomaly
scores for uncertainty estimation. The resulting calibrated posteriors yield
significantly higher predictive entropy on adversarially perturbed inputs than
on clean ones, enabling a practical flagging mechanism for attack detection
while reducing calibration error (ECE). Our findings surface concrete
vulnerabilities in DINOv2-based few-shot anomaly detectors and establish an
evaluation protocol and baseline for robust, uncertainty-aware anomaly
detection. We argue that adversarial robustness and principled uncertainty
quantification are not optional add-ons but essential capabilities if anomaly
detection systems are to be trustworthy and ready for real-world deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法在处理多样化和高度退化的图像时，容易产生噪声放大或错误内容生成，需要更精确的上下文感知机制。

Method: 采用局部-全局上下文感知注意力机制和分布感知的条件机制，逐步保留和细化结构信息。

Result: 在多个超分辨率基准测试中，生成高质量、结构一致且感知准确的图像。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持局部和全局像素关系的同时，显著提升了图像超分辨率的感知质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved significant success in various image
manipulation tasks, including image super-resolution and perceptual quality
enhancement. Pretrained text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion, have
exhibited strong capabilities in synthesizing realistic image content, which
makes them particularly attractive for addressing super-resolution tasks. While
some existing approaches leverage these models to achieve state-of-the-art
results, they often struggle when applied to diverse and highly degraded
images, leading to noise amplification or incorrect content generation. To
address these limitations, we propose a contextually precise image
super-resolution framework that effectively maintains both local and global
pixel relationships through Local-Global Context-Aware Attention, enabling the
generation of high-quality images. Furthermore, we propose a distribution- and
perceptual-aligned conditioning mechanism in the pixel space to enhance
perceptual fidelity. This mechanism captures fine-grained pixel-level
representations while progressively preserving and refining structural
information, transitioning from local content details to the global structural
composition. During inference, our method generates high-quality images that
are structurally consistent with the original content, mitigating artifacts and
ensuring realistic detail restoration. Extensive experiments on multiple
super-resolution benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in
producing high-fidelity, perceptually accurate reconstructions.

Motivation: 现有基础模型在图像编辑中表现优异，但扩展到3D编辑时面临计算成本高和闭源API限制的问题。

Method: 使用视频生成基础模型传播编辑，引入视图选择策略确保多视图一致性，并采用前馈重建避免昂贵优化。

Result: 在常用3D编辑数据集上表现优于现有方法，编辑质量和效率均显著提升。

Conclusion: EditCast3D为将基础模型集成到3D编辑流程提供了可扩展且通用的范例。

Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have driven remarkable progress in image
editing, yet their extension to 3D editing remains underexplored. A natural
approach is to replace the image editing modules in existing workflows with
foundation models. However, their heavy computational demands and the
restrictions and costs of closed-source APIs make plugging these models into
existing iterative editing strategies impractical. To address this limitation,
we propose EditCast3D, a pipeline that employs video generation foundation
models to propagate edits from a single first frame across the entire dataset
prior to reconstruction. While editing propagation enables dataset-level
editing via video models, its consistency remains suboptimal for 3D
reconstruction, where multi-view alignment is essential. To overcome this,
EditCast3D introduces a view selection strategy that explicitly identifies
consistent and reconstruction-friendly views and adopts feedforward
reconstruction without requiring costly refinement. In combination, the
pipeline both minimizes reliance on expensive image editing and mitigates
prompt ambiguities that arise when applying foundation models independently
across images. We evaluate EditCast3D on commonly used 3D editing datasets and
compare it against state-of-the-art 3D editing baselines, demonstrating
superior editing quality and high efficiency. These results establish
EditCast3D as a scalable and general paradigm for integrating foundation models
into 3D editing pipelines. The code is available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D视线估计方法因标注数据稀缺和多样性不足，难以泛化到不同数据域。

Conclusion: OmniGaze有效解决了跨域泛化问题，可作为可扩展的数据引擎。

Abstract: Current 3D gaze estimation methods struggle to generalize across diverse data
domains, primarily due to i) the scarcity of annotated datasets, and ii) the
insufficient diversity of labeled data. In this work, we present OmniGaze, a
semi-supervised framework for 3D gaze estimation, which utilizes large-scale
unlabeled data collected from diverse and unconstrained real-world environments
to mitigate domain bias and generalize gaze estimation in the wild. First, we
build a diverse collection of unlabeled facial images, varying in facial
appearances, background environments, illumination conditions, head poses, and
eye occlusions. In order to leverage unlabeled data spanning a broader
distribution, OmniGaze adopts a standard pseudo-labeling strategy and devises a
reward model to assess the reliability of pseudo labels. Beyond pseudo labels
as 3D direction vectors, the reward model also incorporates visual embeddings
extracted by an off-the-shelf visual encoder and semantic cues from gaze
perspective generated by prompting a Multimodal Large Language Model to compute
confidence scores. Then, these scores are utilized to select high-quality
pseudo labels and weight them for loss computation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that OmniGaze achieves state-of-the-art performance on five
datasets under both in-domain and cross-domain settings. Furthermore, we also
evaluate the efficacy of OmniGaze as a scalable data engine for gaze
estimation, which exhibits robust zero-shot generalization on four unseen
datasets.

Motivation: 视频MAR模型存在慢启动问题和误差累积问题，影响了生成质量和效率。

Method: 提出CanvasMAR模型，引入画布机制提供全局结构，采用组合式无分类器引导和噪声增强画布。

Result: 在BAIR和Kinetics-600基准测试中表现优异，生成高质量视频且减少自回归步骤。

Conclusion: CanvasMAR在自回归模型中表现突出，可与基于扩散的方法媲美。

Abstract: Masked autoregressive models (MAR) have recently emerged as a powerful
paradigm for image and video generation, combining the flexibility of masked
modeling with the potential of continuous tokenizer. However, video MAR models
suffer from two major limitations: the slow-start problem, caused by the lack
of a structured global prior at early sampling stages, and error accumulation
across the autoregression in both spatial and temporal dimensions. In this
work, we propose CanvasMAR, a novel video MAR model that mitigates these issues
by introducing a canvas mechanism--a blurred, global prediction of the next
frame, used as the starting point for masked generation. The canvas provides
global structure early in sampling, enabling faster and more coherent frame
synthesis. Furthermore, we introduce compositional classifier-free guidance
that jointly enlarges spatial (canvas) and temporal conditioning, and employ
noise-based canvas augmentation to enhance robustness. Experiments on the BAIR
and Kinetics-600 benchmarks demonstrate that CanvasMAR produces high-quality
videos with fewer autoregressive steps. Our approach achieves remarkable
performance among autoregressive models on Kinetics-600 dataset and rivals
diffusion-based methods.

Conclusion: 结合视觉、文本和结构化知识显著提升了开放域视觉实体识别的性能，尤其是对罕见和未见实体的识别。

Abstract: Open-domain visual entity recognition aims to identify and link entities
depicted in images to a vast and evolving set of real-world concepts, such as
those found in Wikidata. Unlike conventional classification tasks with fixed
label sets, it operates under open-set conditions, where most target entities
are unseen during training and exhibit long-tail distributions. This makes the
task inherently challenging due to limited supervision, high visual ambiguity,
and the need for semantic disambiguation. In this work, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Contrastive Learning (KnowCoL) framework that combines both
images and text descriptions into a shared semantic space grounded by
structured information from Wikidata. By abstracting visual and textual inputs
to a conceptual level, the model leverages entity descriptions, type
hierarchies, and relational context to support zero-shot entity recognition. We
evaluate our approach on the OVEN benchmark, a large-scale open-domain visual
recognition dataset with Wikidata IDs as the label space. Our experiments show
that using visual, textual, and structured knowledge greatly improves accuracy,
especially for rare and unseen entities. Our smallest model improves the
accuracy on unseen entities by 10.5% compared to the state-of-the-art, despite
being 35 times smaller.

TL;DR: FlashWorld是一种生成模型，能够从单张图像或文本提示快速生成3D场景，速度比之前工作快10~100倍，且渲染质量更高。


<details>

Motivation: 传统多视图导向（MV-oriented）方法生成多视图图像后进行3D重建，存在速度慢的问题。FlashWorld转向直接生成3D高斯表示的3D导向方法，同时通过双模式预训练和跨模式后训练整合两种范式的优势。

Method: 1. 双模式预训练：基于视频扩散模型的先验，预训练支持MV和3D导向的双模式多视图扩散模型。2. 跨模式后训练蒸馏：通过匹配3D导向模式到高质量MV导向模式的分布，提升视觉质量并减少去噪步骤。3. 利用单视图图像和文本提示增强泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明，FlashWorld在速度和渲染质量上均优于现有方法，且能高效处理分布外输入。

Conclusion: FlashWorld通过3D导向方法和跨模式训练，实现了快速、高质量的3D场景生成，同时保持了3D一致性。

Abstract: We propose FlashWorld, a generative model that produces 3D scenes from a
single image or text prompt in seconds, 10~100$\times$ faster than previous
works while possessing superior rendering quality. Our approach shifts from the
conventional multi-view-oriented (MV-oriented) paradigm, which generates
multi-view images for subsequent 3D reconstruction, to a 3D-oriented approach
where the model directly produces 3D Gaussian representations during multi-view
generation. While ensuring 3D consistency, 3D-oriented method typically suffers
poor visual quality. FlashWorld includes a dual-mode pre-training phase
followed by a cross-mode post-training phase, effectively integrating the
strengths of both paradigms. Specifically, leveraging the prior from a video
diffusion model, we first pre-train a dual-mode multi-view diffusion model,
which jointly supports MV-oriented and 3D-oriented generation modes. To bridge
the quality gap in 3D-oriented generation, we further propose a cross-mode
post-training distillation by matching distribution from consistent 3D-oriented
mode to high-quality MV-oriented mode. This not only enhances visual quality
while maintaining 3D consistency, but also reduces the required denoising steps
for inference. Also, we propose a strategy to leverage massive single-view
images and text prompts during this process to enhance the model's
generalization to out-of-distribution inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the superiority and efficiency of our method.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于去噪扩散桥模型（DDBMs）的方法，用于从病理图像生成健康反事实图像，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中，生成健康反事实图像对异常检测和分析工具应用具有重要意义，但现有方法难以平衡异常去除与个体特征保留。

Method: 利用DDBMs，通过同时以健康图像和合成病理图像为条件，生成更精准的反事实图像。

Result: DDBM在分割和异常检测任务中优于现有扩散模型和全监督方法。

Conclusion: DDBMs能有效生成保留个体解剖特征且去除病理的反事实图像，为医学影像分析提供了新工具。

Abstract: Generating healthy counterfactuals from pathological images holds significant
promise in medical imaging, e.g., in anomaly detection or for application of
analysis tools that are designed for healthy scans. These counterfactuals
should represent what a patient's scan would plausibly look like in the absence
of pathology, preserving individual anatomical characteristics while modifying
only the pathological regions. Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have become popular methods for generating healthy counterfactuals of pathology
data. Typically, this involves training on solely healthy data with the
assumption that a partial denoising process will be unable to model disease
regions and will instead reconstruct a closely matched healthy counterpart.
More recent methods have incorporated synthetic pathological images to better
guide the diffusion process. However, it remains challenging to guide the
generative process in a way that effectively balances the removal of anomalies
with the retention of subject-specific features. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel application of denoising diffusion bridge models (DDBMs) -
which, unlike DDPMs, condition the diffusion process not only on the initial
point (i.e., the healthy image), but also on the final point (i.e., a
corresponding synthetically generated pathological image). Treating the
pathological image as a structurally informative prior enables us to generate
counterfactuals that closely match the patient's anatomy while selectively
removing pathology. The results show that our DDBM outperforms previously
proposed diffusion models and fully supervised approaches at segmentation and
anomaly detection tasks.

Motivation: 现代AI模型在处理多模态查询时，容易受到嵌入图像中的恶意意图攻击。传统方法需要高昂的数据集和训练成本，而推理时对齐方法又会导致误判和速度下降。

Method: 通过重新设计查询以增强对安全关键图像区域的跨模态注意力，实现查询级别的风险评估，并自适应地调整激活以生成安全且有用的响应。

Result: RAS显著降低了攻击成功率，保持了通用任务性能，并提高了推理速度。

Conclusion: RAS是一种高效的多模态安全对齐方法，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of modern AI models is ensuring that they provide
helpful responses to benign queries while refusing malicious ones. But often,
the models are vulnerable to multimodal queries with harmful intent embedded in
images. One approach for safety alignment is training with extensive safety
datasets at the significant costs in both dataset curation and training.
Inference-time alignment mitigates these costs, but introduces two drawbacks:
excessive refusals from misclassified benign queries and slower inference speed
due to iterative output adjustments. To overcome these limitations, we propose
to reformulate queries to strengthen cross-modal attention to safety-critical
image regions, enabling accurate risk assessment at the query level. Using the
assessed risk, it adaptively steers activations to generate responses that are
safe and helpful without overhead from iterative output adjustments. We call
this Risk-adaptive Activation Steering (RAS). Extensive experiments across
multiple benchmarks on multimodal safety and utility demonstrate that the RAS
significantly reduces attack success rates, preserves general task performance,
and improves inference speed over prior inference-time defenses.

Conclusion: MVCustom填补了多视角定制化任务的空白，展示了其高效性和一致性。

Abstract: Multi-view generation with camera pose control and prompt-based customization
are both essential elements for achieving controllable generative models.
However, existing multi-view generation models do not support customization
with geometric consistency, whereas customization models lack explicit
viewpoint control, making them challenging to unify. Motivated by these gaps,
we introduce a novel task, multi-view customization, which aims to jointly
achieve multi-view camera pose control and customization. Due to the scarcity
of training data in customization, existing multi-view generation models, which
inherently rely on large-scale datasets, struggle to generalize to diverse
prompts. To address this, we propose MVCustom, a novel diffusion-based
framework explicitly designed to achieve both multi-view consistency and
customization fidelity. In the training stage, MVCustom learns the subject's
identity and geometry using a feature-field representation, incorporating the
text-to-video diffusion backbone enhanced with dense spatio-temporal attention,
which leverages temporal coherence for multi-view consistency. In the inference
stage, we introduce two novel techniques: depth-aware feature rendering
explicitly enforces geometric consistency, and consistent-aware latent
completion ensures accurate perspective alignment of the customized subject and
surrounding backgrounds. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVCustom is the
only framework that simultaneously achieves faithful multi-view generation and
customization.

Motivation: Willis环的复杂几何结构使得传统骨架化技术难以提取可靠的中心线，且公开的中心线数据集稀缺，因此需要开发一种更可靠的方法。

Method: 结合U-Net骨架化和A*图连接算法，从200名中风患者的MRA和CTA图像中提取中心线图和形态特征。

Result: 算法在测试集上表现出高精度（F1=1），节点距离误差小于1体素，特征误差低于5%，相关性高于0.95。

Conclusion: 学习骨架化结合图连接能有效提取解剖学合理的中心线，数据集和算法已公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a critical network of arteries in the brain,
often implicated in cerebrovascular pathologies. Voxel-level segmentation is an
important first step toward an automated CoW assessment, but a full
quantitative analysis requires centerline representations. However,
conventional skeletonization techniques often struggle to extract reliable
centerlines due to the CoW's complex geometry, and publicly available
centerline datasets remain scarce. To address these challenges, we used a
thinning-based skeletonization algorithm to extract and curate centerline
graphs and morphometric features from the TopCoW dataset, which includes 200
stroke patients, each imaged with MRA and CTA. The curated graphs were used to
develop a baseline algorithm for centerline and feature extraction, combining
U-Net-based skeletonization with A* graph connection. Performance was evaluated
on a held-out test set, focusing on anatomical accuracy and feature robustness.
Further, we used the extracted features to predict the frequency of fetal PCA
variants, confirm theoretical bifurcation optimality relations, and detect
subtle modality differences. The baseline algorithm consistently reconstructed
graph topology with high accuracy (F1 = 1), and the average Euclidean node
distance between reference and predicted graphs was below one voxel. Features
such as segment radius, length, and bifurcation ratios showed strong
robustness, with median relative errors below 5% and Pearson correlations above
0.95. Our results demonstrate the utility of learning-based skeletonization
combined with graph connection for anatomically plausible centerline
extraction. We emphasize the importance of going beyond simple voxel-based
measures by evaluating anatomical accuracy and feature robustness. The dataset
and baseline algorithm have been released to support further method development
and clinical research.

Abstract: We present LiFMCR, a novel dataset for the registration of multiple micro

are limited to single-camera setups and typically lack external ground truth,
LiFMCR provides synchronized image sequences from two high-resolution Raytrix
R32 plenoptic cameras, together with high-precision 6-degrees of freedom (DoF)
poses recorded by a Vicon motion capture system. This unique combination
enables rigorous evaluation of multi-camera light field registration methods.
  As a baseline, we provide two complementary registration approaches: a robust
3D transformation estimation via a RANSAC-based method using cross-view point
clouds, and a plenoptic PnP algorithm estimating extrinsic 6-DoF poses from
single light field images. Both explicitly integrate the plenoptic camera
model, enabling accurate and scalable multi-camera registration. Experiments
show strong alignment with the ground truth, supporting reliable multi-view
light field processing.

Motivation: 低场MRI成本低、易获取且安全，但分辨率低、信噪比差，合成高场MRI可减少对昂贵设备的依赖，但现有方法在解剖保真度和图像对比度上存在不足。

Method: 采用循环一致性约束的扩散模型，结合切片间感知网络和局部结构校正网络，通过对比学习和自重建增强解剖保真度。

Conclusion: CSS-Diff能够合成定量可靠且解剖一致的高场MRI图像。

Abstract: Synthesizing high-quality images from low-field MRI holds significant
potential. Low-field MRI is cheaper, more accessible, and safer, but suffers
from low resolution and poor signal-to-noise ratio. This synthesis process can
reduce reliance on costly acquisitions and expand data availability. However,
synthesizing high-field MRI still suffers from a clinical fidelity gap. There
is a need to preserve anatomical fidelity, enhance fine-grained structural
details, and bridge domain gaps in image contrast. To address these issues, we
propose a \emph{cyclic self-supervised diffusion (CSS-Diff)} framework for
high-field MRI synthesis from real low-field MRI data. Our core idea is to
reformulate diffusion-based synthesis under a cycle-consistent constraint. It
enforces anatomical preservation throughout the generative process rather than
just relying on paired pixel-level supervision. The CSS-Diff framework further
incorporates two novel processes. The slice-wise gap perception network aligns
inter-slice inconsistencies via contrastive learning. The local structure
correction network enhances local feature restoration through
self-reconstruction of masked and perturbed patches. Extensive experiments on
cross-field synthesis tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method,
achieving state-of-the-art performance (e.g., 31.80 $\pm$ 2.70 dB in PSNR,
0.943 $\pm$ 0.102 in SSIM, and 0.0864 $\pm$ 0.0689 in LPIPS). Beyond pixel-wise
fidelity, our method also preserves fine-grained anatomical structures compared
with the original low-field MRI (e.g., left cerebral white matter error drops
from 12.1$\%$ to 2.1$\%$, cortex from 4.2$\%$ to 3.7$\%$). To conclude, our
CSS-Diff can synthesize images that are both quantitatively reliable and
anatomically consistent.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的图构建方法LSGC和混合CNN-GNN模型LogViG，通过限制长距离连接提升性能，并在多尺度高分辨率架构中融合特征，优于现有ViG、CNN和ViT模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图构建方法（如KNN）在大图像上计算成本高，且SVGA的固定步长尺度可能导致信息丢失或冗余连接。

Method: 提出Logarithmic Scalable Graph Construction (LSGC)方法，结合CNN-GNN的LogViG模型，并引入多尺度高分辨率分支。

Result: LogViG在ImageNet-1K上达到79.9%的top-1准确率，比Vision GNN高1.7%，参数和计算量分别减少24.3%和35.3%。

Conclusion: 通过LSGC利用长距离连接可以超越当前最先进的ViG性能。

Abstract: Vision graph neural networks (ViG) have demonstrated promise in vision tasks
as a competitive alternative to conventional convolutional neural nets (CNN)
and transformers (ViTs); however, common graph construction methods, such as
k-nearest neighbor (KNN), can be expensive on larger images. While methods such
as Sparse Vision Graph Attention (SVGA) have shown promise, SVGA's fixed step
scale can lead to over-squashing and missing multiple connections to gain the
same information that could be gained from a long-range link. Through this
observation, we propose a new graph construction method, Logarithmic Scalable
Graph Construction (LSGC) to enhance performance by limiting the number of
long-range links. To this end, we propose LogViG, a novel hybrid CNN-GNN model
that utilizes LSGC. Furthermore, inspired by the successes of multi-scale and
high-resolution architectures, we introduce and apply a high-resolution branch
and fuse features between our high-resolution and low-resolution branches for a
multi-scale high-resolution Vision GNN network. Extensive experiments show that
LogViG beats existing ViG, CNN, and ViT architectures in terms of accuracy,
GMACs, and parameters on image classification and semantic segmentation tasks.
Our smallest model, Ti-LogViG, achieves an average top-1 accuracy on
ImageNet-1K of 79.9% with a standard deviation of 0.2%, 1.7% higher average
accuracy than Vision GNN with a 24.3% reduction in parameters and 35.3%
reduction in GMACs. Our work shows that leveraging long-range links in graph
construction for ViGs through our proposed LSGC can exceed the performance of
current state-of-the-art ViGs. Code is available at

TL;DR: UniCalli是一个统一的扩散框架，用于中文书法的列级识别和生成，解决了现有方法在页面美学和正确性之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在高质量字符生成和页面美学（如连笔和间距）之间存在矛盾，UniCalli旨在通过联合训练识别和生成任务来解决这一问题。

Method: UniCalli采用非对称噪声和栅格化框图提供空间先验，结合合成、标注和未标注数据进行训练。

Result: 模型在生成质量和识别性能上达到最优，尤其在连笔连续性和布局保真度方面表现突出，并能扩展到其他古代文字。

Conclusion: UniCalli通过联合训练识别和生成任务，实现了高质量书法生成和识别，并展示了在其他古代文字上的扩展能力。

Abstract: Computational replication of Chinese calligraphy remains challenging.
Existing methods falter, either creating high-quality isolated characters while
ignoring page-level aesthetics like ligatures and spacing, or attempting page
synthesis at the expense of calligraphic correctness. We introduce
\textbf{UniCalli}, a unified diffusion framework for column-level recognition
and generation. Training both tasks jointly is deliberate: recognition
constrains the generator to preserve character structure, while generation
provides style and layout priors. This synergy fosters concept-level
abstractions that improve both tasks, especially in limited-data regimes. We
curated a dataset of over 8,000 digitized pieces, with ~4,000 densely
annotated. UniCalli employs asymmetric noising and a rasterized box map for
spatial priors, trained on a mix of synthetic, labeled, and unlabeled data. The
model achieves state-of-the-art generative quality with superior ligature
continuity and layout fidelity, alongside stronger recognition. The framework
successfully extends to other ancient scripts, including Oracle bone
inscriptions and Egyptian hieroglyphs. Code and data can be viewed in

Motivation: 为轻量级模型提供全面的多模态理解和语音生成能力，推动智能交互系统的发展。

Method: 整合视觉编码器、音频编码器、大语言模型和语音解码器，采用多阶段训练策略，包括预训练和后训练。

Result: 在多项任务中表现优于同类开源模型，尤其在长期记忆能力上突出，4B模型性能接近7B模型。

Conclusion: InteractiveOmni是下一代智能交互系统的开源基础，在多模态理解和语音生成任务中达到先进水平。

Abstract: We introduce InteractiveOmni, a unified and open-source omni-modal large
language model for audio-visual multi-turn interaction, ranging from 4B to 8B
parameters, designed to lead the field of lightweight models by offering
comprehensive omni-modal understanding and speech generation capabilities. To
achieve this, we integrate the vision encoder, audio encoder, large language
model, and speech decoder into a unified model for understanding and generation
tasks. We design a multi-stage training strategy to ensure robust cross-modal
capabilities, including pre-training for omni-modal understanding, followed by
post-training with speech conversation and audio-visual interaction. To enable
human-like long-term conversational ability, we meticulously curate a
multi-turn training dataset that enhances the model's ability to handle complex
and multi-turn interactions. To effectively evaluate the multi-turn memory and
speech interaction capabilities, we construct the multi-modal multi-turn memory
benchmark and the multi-turn speech interaction benchmark. Experiments
demonstrate that InteractiveOmni significantly outperforms leading open-source
models and provides a more intelligent multi-turn audio-visual experience,
particularly in its long-term memory capabilities. Notably, InteractiveOmni-4B
is comparable to the much larger model like Qwen2.5-Omni-7B on general
benchmarks, and it can retain 97% of the performance of the InteractiveOmni-8B
while utilizing only 50% of the model size. Achieving state-of-the-art results
against similarly sized models across image, audio, video understanding, and
speech generation tasks, InteractiveOmni is an accessible, open-source
foundation for next-generation intelligent interactive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在结构化视觉（如图表和图表）推理中缺乏验证机制的问题。

Method: 提出RECODE框架，通过生成候选程序、选择最忠实重建并迭代优化代码，将视觉任务转化为可验证的符号问题。

Result: 在CharXiv、ChartQA和Geometry3K等基准测试中显著优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 将视觉感知基于可执行代码为多模态推理提供了更准确和可验证的新路径。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for
structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a
mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering
-- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new
modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an
agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce
the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful
reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only
transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem,
but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On
various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K,
RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use
code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that
grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more
accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.

Result: 揭示了最先进模型在跨模态依赖和性能差异上的新见解。

Conclusion: 为推进统一模型提供了可靠基础。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models aim to jointly enable visual understanding and
generation, yet current benchmarks rarely examine their true integration.
Existing evaluations either treat the two abilities in isolation or overlook
tasks that inherently couple them. To address this gap, we present Uni-MMMU, a
comprehensive and discipline-aware benchmark that systematically unfolds the
bidirectional synergy between generation and understanding across eight
reasoning-centric domains, including science, coding, mathematics, and puzzles.
Each task is bidirectionally coupled, demanding models to (i) leverage
conceptual understanding to guide precise visual synthesis, or (ii) utilize
generation as a cognitive scaffold for analytical reasoning. Uni-MMMU
incorporates verifiable intermediate reasoning steps, unique ground truths, and
a reproducible scoring protocol for both textual and visual outputs. Through
extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art unified, generation-only, and
understanding-only models, we reveal substantial performance disparities and
cross-modal dependencies, offering new insights into when and how these
abilities reinforce one another, and establishing a reliable foundation for
advancing unified models.

Conclusion: 该研究为fMRI数据的基础模型构建提供了有效方法，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: A key question for adapting modern deep learning architectures to functional
MRI (fMRI) is how to represent the data for model input. To bridge the modality
gap between fMRI and natural images, we transform the 4D volumetric fMRI data
into videos of 2D fMRI activity flat maps. We train Vision Transformers on 2.3K
hours of fMRI flat map videos from the Human Connectome Project using the
spatiotemporal masked autoencoder (MAE) framework. We observe that masked fMRI
modeling performance improves with dataset size according to a strict power
scaling law. Downstream classification benchmarks show that our model learns
rich representations supporting both fine-grained state decoding across
subjects, as well as subject-specific trait decoding across changes in brain
state. This work is part of an ongoing open science project to build foundation
models for fMRI data. Our code and datasets are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决故事延续任务中如何有效利用先前视觉上下文并确保与当前文本输入语义对齐的挑战。

Method: 引入AVC框架，结合CLIP模型检索语义对齐的图像，并在无相关图像时限制视觉上下文的影响。

Result: AVC在连贯性、语义一致性和视觉保真度上优于基线方法，尤其在视觉上下文冲突时表现突出。

Conclusion: AVC通过自适应视觉条件和数据质量改进，显著提升了故事延续任务的效果。

Abstract: Story continuation focuses on generating the next image in a narrative
sequence so that it remains coherent with both the ongoing text description and
the previously observed images. A central challenge in this setting lies in
utilizing prior visual context effectively, while ensuring semantic alignment
with the current textual input. In this work, we introduce AVC (Adaptive Visual
Conditioning), a framework for diffusion-based story continuation. AVC employs
the CLIP model to retrieve the most semantically aligned image from previous
frames. Crucially, when no sufficiently relevant image is found, AVC adaptively
restricts the influence of prior visuals to only the early stages of the
diffusion process. This enables the model to exploit visual context when
beneficial, while avoiding the injection of misleading or irrelevant
information. Furthermore, we improve data quality by re-captioning a noisy
dataset using large language models, thereby strengthening textual supervision
and semantic alignment. Quantitative results and human evaluations demonstrate
that AVC achieves superior coherence, semantic consistency, and visual fidelity
compared to strong baselines, particularly in challenging cases where prior
visuals conflict with the current input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着扩散模型在视觉内容生成中的广泛应用，证明作者身份和保护版权变得至关重要，尤其是在模型私有化的情况下。

Method: 通过将哈希函数引入噪声采样过程，利用初始噪声与生成内容的高度相关性，确保无法从内容中恢复有效种子。

Result: 实验验证了NoisePrints在多个先进扩散模型上的有效性，验证过程仅需种子和输出，无需模型权重。

Conclusion: NoisePrints提供了一种高效、可扩展的版权保护方案，且通过零知识证明保护种子隐私。

Abstract: With the rapid adoption of diffusion models for visual content generation,
proving authorship and protecting copyright have become critical. This
challenge is particularly important when model owners keep their models private
and may be unwilling or unable to handle authorship issues, making third-party
verification essential. A natural solution is to embed watermarks for later
verification. However, existing methods require access to model weights and
rely on computationally heavy procedures, rendering them impractical and
non-scalable. To address these challenges, we propose , a lightweight
watermarking scheme that utilizes the random seed used to initialize the
diffusion process as a proof of authorship without modifying the generation
process. Our key observation is that the initial noise derived from a seed is
highly correlated with the generated visual content. By incorporating a hash
function into the noise sampling process, we further ensure that recovering a
valid seed from the content is infeasible. We also show that sampling an
alternative seed that passes verification is infeasible, and demonstrate the
robustness of our method under various manipulations. Finally, we show how to
use cryptographic zero-knowledge proofs to prove ownership without revealing
the seed. By keeping the seed secret, we increase the difficulty of watermark
removal. In our experiments, we validate NoisePrints on multiple
state-of-the-art diffusion models for images and videos, demonstrating
efficient verification using only the seed and output, without requiring access
to model weights.

Result: Bee-8B在性能上达到新SOTA，部分超越半开源模型。

Conclusion: 高质量数据是开发竞争性完全开源MLLM的关键。

Abstract: Fully open multimodal large language models (MLLMs) currently lag behind
proprietary counterparts, primarily due to a significant gap in data quality
for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Existing open-source datasets are often
plagued by widespread noise and a critical deficit in complex reasoning data,
such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), which hinders the development of advanced model
capabilities. Addressing these challenges, our work makes three primary
contributions. First, we introduce Honey-Data-15M, a new SFT dataset comprising
approximately 15 million QA pairs, processed through multiple cleaning
techniques and enhanced with a novel dual-level (short and long) CoT enrichment
strategy. Second, we introduce HoneyPipe, the data curation pipeline, and its
underlying framework DataStudio, providing the community with a transparent and
adaptable methodology for data curation that moves beyond static dataset
releases. Finally, to validate our dataset and pipeline, we train Bee-8B, an 8B
model on Honey-Data-15M. Experiments show that Bee-8B establishes a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) for fully open MLLMs, achieving performance that is
competitive with, and in some cases surpasses, recent semi-open models such as
InternVL3.5-8B. Our work delivers to the community a suite of foundational
resources, including: the Honey-Data-15M corpus; the full-stack suite
comprising HoneyPipe and DataStudio; training recipes; an evaluation harness;
and the model weights. This effort demonstrates that a principled focus on data
quality is a key pathway to developing fully open MLLMs that are highly
competitive with their semi-open counterparts.

Motivation: 现有3D LLMs缺乏统一的语义和几何表示，导致定位性能差或依赖外部模块，阻碍定位与空间推理的无缝集成。

Method: 提出双路径池化机制，紧密对齐几何特征与语义和位置线索，构建基于图像块的统一3D表示。

Result: GS-Reasoner在3D视觉定位中表现优异，显著提升空间推理能力，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: GS-Reasoner为3D空间推理提供了统一且自包含的框架，通过GCoT数据集进一步弥合定位与推理的差距。

Abstract: In this paper, we claim that 3D visual grounding is the cornerstone of
spatial reasoning and introduce the Grounded-Spatial Reasoner (GS-Reasoner) to
explore the effective spatial representations that bridge the gap between them.
Existing 3D LLMs suffer from the absence of a unified 3D representation capable
of jointly capturing semantic and geometric information. This deficiency is
manifested either in poor performance on grounding or in an excessive reliance
on external modules, ultimately hindering the seamless integration of grounding
and spatial reasoning. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective
dual-path pooling mechanism that tightly aligns geometric features with both
semantic and positional cues, constructing a unified image patch-based 3D
representation that encapsulates all essential information without increasing
the number of input tokens. Leveraging this holistic representation,
GS-Reasoner is the first 3D LLM that achieves autoregressive grounding entirely
without external modules while delivering performance comparable to
state-of-the-art models, establishing a unified and self-contained framework
for 3D spatial reasoning. To further bridge grounding and spatial reasoning, we
introduce the Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) dataset. This dataset is
meticulously curated to include both 3D bounding box annotations for objects
referenced in reasoning questions and step-by-step reasoning paths that
integrate grounding as a core component of the problem-solving process.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that GS-Reasoner achieves impressive results
on 3D visual grounding, which in turn significantly enhances its spatial
reasoning capabilities, leading to state-of-the-art performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频的动态建模需要有效的时空表示，像素作为视频的基本单元，其连续3D轨迹是动态建模的关键。

Method: 提出Trajectory Field表示法，通过神经网络Trace Anything预测每个像素的3D轨迹（B样条参数化），实现单次前向预测。

Result: Trace Anything在新基准测试中表现优异，效率高且具备多种新兴能力（如目标条件操作、运动预测等）。

Conclusion: Trajectory Field和Trace Anything为视频动态建模提供了高效且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective spatio-temporal representation is fundamental to modeling,
understanding, and predicting dynamics in videos. The atomic unit of a video,
the pixel, traces a continuous 3D trajectory over time, serving as the
primitive element of dynamics. Based on this principle, we propose representing
any video as a Trajectory Field: a dense mapping that assigns a continuous 3D
trajectory function of time to each pixel in every frame. With this
representation, we introduce Trace Anything, a neural network that predicts the
entire trajectory field in a single feed-forward pass. Specifically, for each
pixel in each frame, our model predicts a set of control points that
parameterizes a trajectory (i.e., a B-spline), yielding its 3D position at
arbitrary query time instants. We trained the Trace Anything model on
large-scale 4D data, including data from our new platform, and our experiments
demonstrate that: (i) Trace Anything achieves state-of-the-art performance on
our new benchmark for trajectory field estimation and performs competitively on
established point-tracking benchmarks; (ii) it offers significant efficiency
gains thanks to its one-pass paradigm, without requiring iterative optimization
or auxiliary estimators; and (iii) it exhibits emergent abilities, including
goal-conditioned manipulation, motion forecasting, and spatio-temporal fusion.

Abstract: We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin
designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and
unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection
and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process.
This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a
comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating
visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs
consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap
from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two
automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train
OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for
universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3).
Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification
and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We
propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that
leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within
unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through
iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal
verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios.
Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7),
and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods,
such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual
verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation
and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and
controllable next-generation reasoning systems.

Conclusion: VisCoP是一种高效且保留源知识的领域适应策略。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at general visual reasoning tasks
but exhibit sharp performance degradation when applied to novel domains with
substantial distribution shifts from pretraining data. Existing domain
adaptation approaches finetune different VLM components, but this often results
in limited domain-specific feature learning or catastrophic forgetting of prior
capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Vision Contextualized
Probing (VisCoP), which augments the VLM's vision encoder with a compact set of
learnable visual probes. These probes enable efficient domain-specific
adaptation with minimal modification to pretrained parameters. We evaluate
VisCoP across three challenging domain adaptation settings-cross-view
(exocentric to egocentric), cross-modal (RGB to depth), and cross-task (human
understanding to robot control). Experiments show that VisCoP consistently
outperforms existing adaptation strategies, achieving superior performance on
target domains while effectively retaining source-domain knowledge.

Result: PhysMaster在简单代理任务中验证了其物理合理性，并展示了广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: PhysMaster为物理感知的视频生成提供了通用且可插拔的解决方案。

Abstract: Video generation models nowadays are capable of generating visually realistic
videos, but often fail to adhere to physical laws, limiting their ability to
generate physically plausible videos and serve as ''world models''. To address
this issue, we propose PhysMaster, which captures physical knowledge as a
representation for guiding video generation models to enhance their
physics-awareness. Specifically, PhysMaster is based on the image-to-video task
where the model is expected to predict physically plausible dynamics from the
input image. Since the input image provides physical priors like relative
positions and potential interactions of objects in the scenario, we devise
PhysEncoder to encode physical information from it as an extra condition to
inject physical knowledge into the video generation process. The lack of proper
supervision on the model's physical performance beyond mere appearance
motivates PhysEncoder to apply reinforcement learning with human feedback to
physical representation learning, which leverages feedback from generation
models to optimize physical representations with Direct Preference Optimization
(DPO) in an end-to-end manner. PhysMaster provides a feasible solution for
improving physics-awareness of PhysEncoder and thus of video generation,
proving its ability on a simple proxy task and generalizability to wide-ranging
physical scenarios. This implies that our PhysMaster, which unifies solutions
for various physical processes via representation learning in the reinforcement
learning paradigm, can act as a generic and plug-in solution for physics-aware
video generation and broader applications.

TL;DR: 机器人通过简单形状组合的玩具学习抓取，实现零样本泛化到真实物体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受儿童通过简单玩具学习泛化技能的启发，研究机器人是否也能实现类似能力。

Method: 使用四种基本形状（球体、长方体、圆柱体、环）随机组合的玩具训练，并提出物体为中心的视觉表示方法。

Result: 在YCB数据集上达到67%的抓取成功率，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过简单玩具训练可实现机器人抓取的泛化能力，为机器人学习提供新路径。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects,
limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that
children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a
small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex
items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can
also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable
grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four
shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training
on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding
strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization
is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection
pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our
model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset,
outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more
in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance
scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the
demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to
scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration
videos, code, checkpoints and our dataset are available on our project page:

### [101] [Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces as Control Barrier Functions for Safe Robot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12919)
*Mouhyemen Khan,Tatsuya Ibuki,Abhijit Chatterjee*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种将高斯过程隐式表面（GPIS）与控制屏障函数（CBF）统一的框架，用于安全边界表示和碰撞避免任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合隐式表面表示和安全控制技术，提供一种更灵活且具有不确定性估计的安全边界方法。

Method: 利用高斯过程隐式表面表示安全边界，并通过稀疏化解决方案（稀疏高斯CBF）解决计算复杂度问题。

Result: 在模拟机械臂和四旋翼飞行器的碰撞避免任务中验证了方法的有效性，实现了安全交互和无碰撞轨迹执行。

Conclusion: 高斯CBF（包括稀疏版本）能够有效处理复杂环境中的安全控制问题，为安全技术提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Level set methods underpin modern safety techniques such as control barrier
functions (CBFs), while also serving as implicit surface representations for
geometric shapes via distance fields. Inspired by these two paradigms, we
propose a unified framework where the implicit surface itself acts as a CBF. We
leverage Gaussian process (GP) implicit surface (GPIS) to represent the safety
boundaries, using safety samples which are derived from sensor measurements to
condition the GP. The GP posterior mean defines the implicit safety surface
(safety belief), while the posterior variance provides a robust safety margin.
Although GPs have favorable properties such as uncertainty estimation and
analytical tractability, they scale cubically with data. To alleviate this
issue, we develop a sparse solution called sparse Gaussian CBFs. To the best of
our knowledge, GPIS have not been explicitly used to synthesize CBFs. We
validate the approach on collision avoidance tasks in two settings: a simulated
7-DOF manipulator operating around the Stanford bunny, and a quadrotor
navigating in 3D around a physical chair. In both cases, Gaussian CBFs (with
and without sparsity) enable safe interaction and collision-free execution of
trajectories that would otherwise intersect the objects.

TL;DR: GMPPI是一种基于采样的控制器，能够跟踪敏捷轨迹并避开障碍物，通过几何SE(3)控制和动态参数优化提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机在复杂环境中高速飞行时的轨迹跟踪和避障问题。

Method: 生成大量候选轨迹并平均，结合几何SE(3)控制和动态参数调整。

Result: 在模拟和实际实验中，GMPPI能高效跟踪轨迹并避障，速度达10-13m/s。

Conclusion: GMPPI在高速飞行和复杂环境中表现出色，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral
(GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories
while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of
candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal
control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using
geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories,
significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce
varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise
parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed
trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI)
implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth
camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step
towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller
can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to
the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed
controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of
up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware
planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile
trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于历史路径库的3D物体路径规划方法，显著提高了在狭窄通道中的规划效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统采样规划器在狭窄通道中效率低，且每次规划都从头开始，浪费了历史信息。

Method: 利用历史路径库，找到相似物体的路径作为近似解，并在配置空间中沿近似路径采样。

Result: 在狭窄通道场景中，方法比OMPL库中的先进方法快85%，且成功率更高。

Conclusion: 该方法通过重用历史信息，显著提升了路径规划效率和成功率，并已开源。

Abstract: Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a
search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless,
essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The
commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees,
struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing
the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking,
various objects must be transported through the same environment. However,
traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information
gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past
solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a
new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when
planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use
its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual
transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate
paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared
with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant
speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method,
often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our
implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package.

Method: 通过比较理论-生物学方法，将omega转向描述为两个行波的叠加，并设计控制器。

Result: 控制器在实验室和复杂环境中实现了高效转向，并可推广到多足机器人。

Conclusion: omega转向策略为无肢机器人提供了一种有效的转向方法，适用于有肢和无肢机器人。

Abstract: Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly
packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial
inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate
limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been
limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective
and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a
microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in
rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform
omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it
remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an
omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a
comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a
superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we
design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning
behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such
omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots,
demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for
elongate robots, with and without limbs.

Conclusion: Actron3D显著优于现有方法，展示了从少量视频中学习高效操作技能的潜力。

Abstract: We present Actron3D, a framework that enables robots to acquire transferable
6-DoF manipulation skills from just a few monocular, uncalibrated, RGB-only
human videos. At its core lies the Neural Affordance Function, a compact
object-centric representation that distills actionable cues from diverse
uncalibrated videos-geometry, visual appearance, and affordance-into a
lightweight neural network, forming a memory bank of manipulation skills.
During deployment, we adopt a pipeline that retrieves relevant affordance
functions and transfers precise 6-DoF manipulation policies via coarse-to-fine
optimization, enabled by continuous queries to the multimodal features encoded
in the neural functions. Experiments in both simulation and the real world
demonstrate that Actron3D significantly outperforms prior methods, achieving a
14.9 percentage point improvement in average success rate across 13 tasks while
requiring only 2-3 demonstration videos per task.

TL;DR: UNCAP是一种基于视觉语言模型的规划方法，通过轻量级自然语言消息和感知不确定性量化，提升多车协同规划的效率和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖高带宽传感器数据传输，要么忽视感知和规划中的不确定性，导致系统难以扩展且不安全。

Method: UNCAP采用两阶段通信协议：先识别最相关的车辆，再传输量化感知不确定性的消息，选择性融合信息以优化决策。

Result: 实验显示，通信带宽减少63%，驾驶安全评分提高31%，决策不确定性降低61%，碰撞距离裕度增加四倍。

Conclusion: UNCAP通过高效且可解释的通信，显著提升了多车协同规划的扩展性和安全性。

Abstract: Safe large-scale coordination of multiple cooperative connected autonomous
vehicles (CAVs) hinges on communication that is both efficient and
interpretable. Existing approaches either rely on transmitting high-bandwidth
raw sensor data streams or neglect perception and planning uncertainties
inherent in shared data, resulting in systems that are neither scalable nor
safe. To address these limitations, we propose Uncertainty-Guided Natural
Language Cooperative Autonomous Planning (UNCAP), a vision-language model-based
planning approach that enables CAVs to communicate via lightweight natural
language messages while explicitly accounting for perception uncertainty in
decision-making. UNCAP features a two-stage communication protocol: (i) an ego
CAV first identifies the subset of vehicles most relevant for information
exchange, and (ii) the selected CAVs then transmit messages that quantitatively
express their perception uncertainty. By selectively fusing messages that
maximize mutual information, this strategy allows the ego vehicle to integrate
only the most relevant signals into its decision-making, improving both the
scalability and reliability of cooperative planning. Experiments across diverse
driving scenarios show a 63% reduction in communication bandwidth with a 31%
increase in driving safety score, a 61% reduction in decision uncertainty, and
a four-fold increase in collision distance margin during near-miss events.

Result: 该系统可用于验证太空运动、机器人操作和接触力学的模型。

Conclusion: 该测试平台为ISAM操作的地面验证提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In-Space Servicing, Assembly, and Manufacturing (ISAM) is a set of emerging
operations that provides several benefits to improve the longevity, capacity,
mo- bility, and expandability of existing and future space assets. Serial
robotic ma- nipulators are particularly vital in accomplishing ISAM operations,
however, the complex perturbation forces and motions associated with movement
of a robotic arm on a free-flying satellite presents a complex controls problem
requiring addi- tional study. While many dynamical models are developed,
experimentally test- ing and validating these models is challenging given that
the models operate in space, where satellites have six-degrees-of-freedom
(6-DOF). This paper attempts to resolve those challenges by presenting the
design and development of a new hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) experimental testbed
utilized to emulate ISAM. This emulation will be accomplished by means of a
6-DOF UR3e robotic arm attached to a satellite bus. This satellite bus is
mounted to a 1-DOF guide-rail system, en- abling the satellite bus and robotic
arm to move freely in one linear direction. This experimental ISAM emulation
system will explore and validate models for space motion, serial robot
manipulation, and contact mechanics.

Result: 生成了多种铰接形状，在几何、运动学和功能指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架将部件建模与功能设计结合，支持快速创建交互式铰接资产。

Abstract: We introduce Kinematic Kitbashing, an automatic framework that synthesizes
functionality-aware articulated objects by reusing parts from existing models.
Given a kinematic graph with a small collection of articulated parts, our
optimizer jointly solves for the spatial placement of every part so that (i)
attachments remain geometrically sound over the entire range of motion and (ii)
the assembled object satisfies user-specified functional goals such as
collision-free actuation, reachability, or trajectory following. At its core is
a kinematics-aware attachment energy that aligns vector distance function
features sampled across multiple articulation snapshots. We embed this
attachment term within an annealed Riemannian Langevin dynamics sampler that
treats functionality objectives as additional energies, enabling robust global
exploration while accommodating non-differentiable functionality objectives and
constraints. Our framework produces a wide spectrum of assembled articulated
shapes, from trash-can wheels grafted onto car bodies to multi-segment lamps,
gear-driven paddlers, and reconfigurable furniture, and delivers strong
quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across geometric,
kinematic, and functional metrics. By tightly coupling articulation-aware
geometry matching with functionality-driven optimization, Kinematic Kitbashing
bridges part-based shape modeling and functional assembly design, empowering
rapid creation of interactive articulated assets.

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，VLA-0超越了所有现有方法，包括那些依赖大规模机器人数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: VLA-0展示了简单设计的强大性能，为视觉-语言-动作模型的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) hold immense promise for enabling
generalist robot manipulation. However, the best way to build them remains an
open question. Current approaches often add complexity, such as modifying the
existing vocabulary of a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with action tokens or
introducing special action heads. Curiously, the simplest strategy of
representing actions directly as text has remained largely unexplored. This
work introduces VLA-0 to investigate this idea. We find that VLA-0 is not only
effective; it is surprisingly powerful. With the right design, VLA-0
outperforms more involved models. On LIBERO, a popular benchmark for evaluating
VLAs, VLA-0 outperforms all existing methods trained on the same robotic data,
including $\pi_0.5$-KI, OpenVLA-OFT and SmolVLA. Furthermore, without
large-scale robotics-specific training, it outperforms methods trained on
large-scale robotic data, like $\pi_0.5$-KI, $\pi_0$, GR00T-N1 and MolmoAct.
These findings also translate to the real world, where VLA-0 outperforms
SmolVLA, a VLA model pre-trained on large-scale real data. This paper
summarizes our unexpected findings and spells out the specific techniques
required to unlock the high performance of this simple yet potent VLA design.

Conclusion: RoboHiMan为改进长时程操作模型提供了方向。

Abstract: Enabling robots to flexibly schedule and compose learned skills for novel
long-horizon manipulation under diverse perturbations remains a core challenge.
Early explorations with end-to-end VLA models show limited success, as these
models struggle to generalize beyond the training distribution. Hierarchical
approaches, where high-level planners generate subgoals for low-level policies,
bring certain improvements but still suffer under complex perturbations,
revealing limited capability in skill composition. However, existing benchmarks
primarily emphasize task completion in long-horizon settings, offering little
insight into compositional generalization, robustness, and the interplay
between planning and execution. To systematically investigate these gaps, we
propose RoboHiMan, a hierarchical evaluation paradigm for compositional
generalization in long-horizon manipulation. RoboHiMan introduces HiMan-Bench,
a benchmark of atomic and compositional tasks under diverse perturbations,
supported by a multi-level training dataset for analyzing progressive data
scaling, and proposes three evaluation paradigms (vanilla, decoupled, coupled)
that probe the necessity of skill composition and reveal bottlenecks in
hierarchical architectures. Experiments highlight clear capability gaps across
representative models and architectures, pointing to directions for advancing
models better suited to real-world long-horizon manipulation tasks. Videos and

Conclusion: DAMM-LOAM通过多度量方法和退化感知技术，有效解决了LiDAR SLAM在复杂环境中的挑战。

Abstract: LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) systems are essential for
enabling precise navigation and environmental reconstruction across various
applications. Although current point-to-plane ICP algorithms perform effec-
tively in structured, feature-rich environments, they struggle in scenarios
with sparse features, repetitive geometric structures, and high-frequency
motion. This leads to degeneracy in 6- DOF pose estimation. Most
state-of-the-art algorithms address these challenges by incorporating
additional sensing modalities, but LiDAR-only solutions continue to face
limitations under such conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel
Degeneracy-Aware Multi-Metric LiDAR Odometry and Map- ping (DAMM-LOAM) module.
Our system improves mapping accuracy through point cloud classification based
on surface normals and neighborhood analysis. Points are classified into
ground, walls, roof, edges, and non-planar points, enabling accurate
correspondences. A Degeneracy-based weighted least squares-based ICP algorithm
is then applied for accurate odom- etry estimation. Additionally, a Scan
Context based back-end is implemented to support robust loop closures.
DAMM-LOAM demonstrates significant improvements in odometry accuracy,
especially in indoor environments such as long corridors

Conclusion: FARM通过整合触觉数据和力信号，显著提升了接触丰富操作的性能，适用于多种力需求场景。

Abstract: Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces
throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or
deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat
visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces
as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present
Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that
integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force
signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect
human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal
Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual
tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated
variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During
policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot
pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across
three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and
dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key
components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations
and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced

Abstract: Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots
capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological
relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in
various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring
dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable
mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level
self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while
each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The
design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage
groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of
achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration
capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent

TL;DR: 离线强化学习通过对抗性微调和自适应课程策略提升策略在动作空间扰动下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习虽高效，但策略在动作空间扰动下表现脆弱，需提升鲁棒性。

Method: 提出离线到在线框架，结合对抗性微调和性能感知课程策略。

Result: 实验显示方法优于纯离线基线，收敛更快且鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: 对抗性微调有效提升策略在不确定环境中的适应性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables sample-efficient policy acquisition
without risky online interaction, yet policies trained on static datasets
remain brittle under action-space perturbations such as actuator faults. This
study introduces an offline-to-online framework that trains policies on clean
data and then performs adversarial fine-tuning, where perturbations are
injected into executed actions to induce compensatory behavior and improve
resilience. A performance-aware curriculum further adjusts the perturbation
probability during training via an exponential-moving-average signal, balancing
robustness and stability throughout the learning process. Experiments on
continuous-control locomotion tasks demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently improves robustness over offline-only baselines and converges
faster than training from scratch. Matching the fine-tuning and evaluation
conditions yields the strongest robustness to action-space perturbations, while
the adaptive curriculum strategy mitigates the degradation of nominal
performance observed with the linear curriculum strategy. Overall, the results
show that adversarial fine-tuning enables adaptive and robust control under
uncertain environments, bridging the gap between offline efficiency and online
adaptability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于迁移学习的轻量级注意力CNN-LSTM模型，用于预测膝关节角度，仅需少量步态周期数据即可实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统EMG信号预测方法在实时性、测试条件代表性和大数据需求方面的局限性。

Method: 使用三个数据集（Georgia Tech、UCI、SMLE），预训练模型后迁移至其他数据集，结合EMG、运动学和交互力输入。

Result: 在异常受试者中，仅用EMG输入时NMAE为6.8%（一步）和13.7%（50步）；结合历史角度后NMAE进一步降低。

Conclusion: 模型在短期和长期康复场景中表现出鲁棒性和强泛化能力。

Abstract: Electromyography (EMG) signals are widely used for predicting body joint
angles through machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods. However,
these approaches often face challenges such as limited real-time applicability,
non-representative test conditions, and the need for large datasets to achieve
optimal performance. This paper presents a transfer-learning framework for knee
joint angle prediction that requires only a few gait cycles from new subjects.
Three datasets - Georgia Tech, the University of California Irvine (UCI), and
the Sharif Mechatronic Lab Exoskeleton (SMLE) - containing four EMG channels
relevant to knee motion were utilized. A lightweight attention-based CNN-LSTM
model was developed and pre-trained on the Georgia Tech dataset, then
transferred to the UCI and SMLE datasets. The proposed model achieved
Normalized Mean Absolute Errors (NMAE) of 6.8 percent and 13.7 percent for
one-step and 50-step predictions on abnormal subjects using EMG inputs alone.
Incorporating historical knee angles reduced the NMAE to 3.1 percent and 3.5
percent for normal subjects, and to 2.8 percent and 7.5 percent for abnormal
subjects. When further adapted to the SMLE exoskeleton with EMG, kinematic, and
interaction force inputs, the model achieved 1.09 percent and 3.1 percent NMAE
for one- and 50-step predictions, respectively. These results demonstrate
robust performance and strong generalization for both short- and long-term
rehabilitation scenarios.

Motivation: 四足机器人在垂直地面扰动（如振荡表面）下的性能尚未充分研究，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Result: 在振荡桥上训练的策略表现出更高的稳定性和适应性，且无需实际桥面经验即可实现鲁棒步态。

Conclusion: 仿真强化学习能有效提升四足机器人在动态地面扰动下的运动能力，为机器人设计提供新思路。

Abstract: Legged robots, particularly quadrupeds, excel at navigating rough terrains,
yet their performance under vertical ground perturbations, such as those from
oscillating surfaces, remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel
approach to enhance quadruped locomotion robustness by training the Unitree Go2
robot on an oscillating bridge - a 13.24-meter steel-and-concrete structure
with a 2.0 Hz eigenfrequency designed to perturb locomotion. Using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm in a MuJoCo simulation, we trained 15 distinct locomotion policies,
combining five gaits (trot, pace, bound, free, default) with three training
conditions: rigid bridge and two oscillating bridge setups with differing
height regulation strategies (relative to bridge surface or ground). Domain
randomization ensured zero-shot transfer to the real-world bridge. Our results
demonstrate that policies trained on the oscillating bridge exhibit superior
stability and adaptability compared to those trained on rigid surfaces. Our
framework enables robust gait patterns even without prior bridge exposure.
These findings highlight the potential of simulation-based RL to improve
quadruped locomotion during dynamic ground perturbations, offering insights for
designing robots capable of traversing vibrating environments.

Motivation: 设计一种能够在非结构化环境中自适应抓取不同形状和大小物体的机器人手。

Method: 结合Hoeckens机构、双平行四边形连杆和四连杆系统，通过运动学分析和仿真优化设计。

Result: 实验验证了三种抓取模式的稳定性和广泛适用性。

Conclusion: Hockens-A Hand在自适应抓取方面表现出色，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A
Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage,
and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes:
parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand
requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical
intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured
environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism
introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at
the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural
transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a
mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects
of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to
optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance.
Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring
smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was
analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's
performance.Experimental validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates
the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental
constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.

Result: 原型实现了约200毫米的线性夹持范围，初步测试显示其在多种物体几何形状下可靠抓取。

Conclusion: Hoecken-D Hand是一种高效、适应性强的机器人夹持解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that
combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to
achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive
envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member
with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling
contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A
double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during
conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to
wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or
thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator,
minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its
own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force
analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces
and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was
prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of
approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both
modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand
as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in
unstructured environments.

Motivation: 通用机器人操作需要处理未见过的物体，触觉感知能补充视觉的不足，但需要高效的在线探索以保持数据效率。

Method: 基于接触丰富的系统识别，提出了一种损失函数，避免刚体接触的数值刚度，并通过最大化预期信息增益进行探索。

Result: 在首次接触后，仅需不到10秒的随机数据即可学习立方体和凸多面体几何形状，模拟和真实机器人实验均显示学习速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过触觉数据高效学习物体形状和位置，为机器人操作提供了数据效率和可预测性。

Abstract: General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen
objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide
significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between
tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion,
but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain
data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move,
requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a
learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to
simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal
robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification
to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation
without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact.
Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with
less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration
scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly
faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments. More information

Conclusion: PlanarMesh在实时性和重建质量上表现出色，适用于高效的3D LiDAR映射。

Abstract: Building an online 3D LiDAR mapping system that produces a detailed surface
reconstruction while remaining computationally efficient is a challenging task.
In this paper, we present PlanarMesh, a novel incremental, mesh-based LiDAR
reconstruction system that adaptively adjusts mesh resolution to achieve
compact, detailed reconstructions in real-time. It introduces a new
representation, planar-mesh, which combines plane modeling and meshing to
capture both large surfaces and detailed geometry. The planar-mesh can be
incrementally updated considering both local surface curvature and free-space
information from sensor measurements. We employ a multi-threaded architecture
with a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) for efficient data storage and fast
search operations, enabling real-time performance. Experimental results show
that our method achieves reconstruction accuracy on par with, or exceeding,
state-of-the-art techniques-including truncated signed distance functions,
occupancy mapping, and voxel-based meshing-while producing smaller output file

Abstract: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part
of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing.
Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring
proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product.
In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to
fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of
varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated
with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft
finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the
steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data,
to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in
incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and
stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values
which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels
and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects
of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce
identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective
distribution based on ripeness levels.

Abstract: In this paper we introduce a visualization methodology to aid a human analyst
in classifying adversity modes that impact lidar scan matching. Our methodology
is intended for offline rather than real-time analysis. The method generates a
vector-field plot that characterizes local discrepancies between a pair of
registered point clouds. The vector field plot reveals patterns that would be
difficult for the analyst to extract from raw point-cloud data. After
introducing our methodology, we apply the process to two proof-of-concept
examples: one a simulation study and the other a field experiment. For both
data sets, a human analyst was able to reason about a series of adversity
mechanisms and iteratively remove those mechanisms from the raw data, to help
focus attention on progressively smaller discrepancies.

Abstract: Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models report impressive success rates on
robotic manipulation benchmarks, yet these results may mask fundamental
weaknesses in robustness. We perform a systematic vulnerability analysis by
introducing controlled perturbations across seven dimensions: objects layout,
camera viewpoints, robot initial states, language instructions, light
conditions, background textures and sensor noise. We comprehensively analyzed
multiple state-of-the-art models and revealed consistent brittleness beneath
apparent competence. Our analysis exposes critical weaknesses: models exhibit
extreme sensitivity to perturbation factors, including camera viewpoints and
robot initial states, with performance dropping from 95% to below 30% under
modest perturbations. Surprisingly, models are largely insensitive to language
variations, with further experiments revealing that models tend to ignore
language instructions completely. Our findings challenge the assumption that
high benchmark scores equate to true competency and highlight the need for
evaluation practices that assess reliability under realistic variation.

Abstract: Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture,
logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based
autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications.
This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where
traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has
become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has
shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing
arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is
still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly
controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are
analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is
available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a
challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were
never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of
professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data
from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

Abstract: Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become
proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are
still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an
approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple
robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first
voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels
are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using
standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce
highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of
tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to
traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the
meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a
live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly
robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user
design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we
introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel
handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization,
hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of
meter-scale objects.

Result: 在多个测试中表现优异，如SimperEnv Google Robot提升14.6%，并展示了更强的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 空间引导训练是可扩展和鲁棒通用机器人的统一原则。

Abstract: We introduce InternVLA-M1, a unified framework for spatial grounding and
robot control that advances instruction-following robots toward scalable,
general-purpose intelligence. Its core idea is spatially guided
vision-language-action training, where spatial grounding serves as the critical
link between instructions and robot actions. InternVLA-M1 employs a two-stage
pipeline: (i) spatial grounding pre-training on over 2.3M spatial reasoning
data to determine ``where to act'' by aligning instructions with visual,
embodiment-agnostic positions, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training
to decide ``how to act'' by generating embodiment-aware actions through
plug-and-play spatial prompting. This spatially guided training recipe yields
consistent gains: InternVLA-M1 outperforms its variant without spatial guidance
by +14.6% on SimplerEnv Google Robot, +17% on WidowX, and +4.3% on LIBERO
Franka, while demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning capability in box,
point, and trace prediction. To further scale instruction following, we built a
simulation engine to collect 244K generalizable pick-and-place episodes,
enabling a 6.2% average improvement across 200 tasks and 3K+ objects. In
real-world clustered pick-and-place, InternVLA-M1 improved by 7.3%, and with
synthetic co-training, achieved +20.6% on unseen objects and novel
configurations. Moreover, in long-horizon reasoning-intensive scenarios, it
surpassed existing works by over 10%. These results highlight spatially guided
training as a unifying principle for scalable and resilient generalist robots.

Conclusion: LT-Gate通过多时间尺度门控显著提升了SNN的持续学习能力，缩小了与传统深度网络的差距。

Abstract: Spiking neural networks (SNNs) promise energy-efficient artificial
intelligence on neuromorphic hardware but struggle with tasks requiring both
fast adaptation and long-term memory, especially in continual learning. We
propose Local Timescale Gating (LT-Gate), a neuron model that combines dual
time-constant dynamics with an adaptive gating mechanism. Each spiking neuron
tracks information on a fast and a slow timescale in parallel, and a learned
gate locally adjusts their influence. This design enables individual neurons to
preserve slow contextual information while responding to fast signals,
addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma. We further introduce a
variance-tracking regularization that stabilizes firing activity, inspired by
biological homeostasis. Empirically, LT-Gate yields significantly improved
accuracy and retention in sequential learning tasks: on a challenging temporal
classification benchmark it achieves about 51 percent final accuracy, compared
to about 46 percent for a recent Hebbian continual-learning baseline and lower
for prior SNN methods. Unlike approaches that require external replay or
expensive orthogonalizations, LT-Gate operates with local updates and is fully
compatible with neuromorphic hardware. In particular, it leverages features of
Intel's Loihi chip (multiple synaptic traces with different decay rates) for
on-chip learning. Our results demonstrate that multi-timescale gating can
substantially enhance continual learning in SNNs, narrowing the gap between
spiking and conventional deep networks on lifelong-learning tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在时间序列（LLM4TS）中的伪对齐问题，提出了TimeSUP技术以提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 伪对齐问题导致LLM4TS模型表现不佳，但社区对其原因讨论有限。

Method: 通过分析伪对齐与LLM中锥效应的关联，提出TimeSUP技术，调整时间序列流形以匹配语言嵌入的维度。

Result: TimeSUP在长期预测中优于现有方法，并能无缝集成到现有LLM4TS流程中。

Conclusion: TimeSUP有效解决了伪对齐问题，显著提升了LLM4TS模型的预测性能。

Abstract: Pseudo-Alignment is a pervasive challenge in many large language models for
time series (LLM4TS) models, often causing them to underperform compared to
linear models or randomly initialised backbones. However, there is limited
discussion in the community for the reasons that pseudo-alignment occurs. In
this work, we conduct a thorough investigation into the root causes of
pseudo-alignment in LLM4TS and build a connection of pseudo-alignment to the
cone effect in LLM. We demonstrate that pseudo-alignment arises from the
interplay of cone effect within pretrained LLM components and the intrinsically
low-dimensional manifold of time-series data. In addition, we also introduce
\textit{\textbf{TimeSUP}}, a novel technique designed to mitigate this issue
and improve forecast performance in existing LLM4TS approaches. TimeSUP
addresses this by increasing the time series manifold to more closely match the
intrinsic dimension of language embeddings, allowing the model to distinguish
temporal signals clearly while still capturing shared structures across
modalities. As a result, representations for time and language tokens remain
distinct yet exhibit high cosine similarity, signifying that the model
preserves each modality unique features while learning their commonalities in a
unified embedding space. Empirically, TimeSUP consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art LLM4TS methods and other lightweight baselines on long-term
forecasting performance. Furthermore, it can be seamlessly integrated into four
existing LLM4TS pipelines and delivers significant improvements in forecasting
performance.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中任务特定知识的捕获、统计异构性和数据不确定性问题，同时确保隐私保护。

Method: 客户端使用CATE生成高斯分布任务嵌入，服务器利用2-Wasserstein距离衡量任务间差距并优化表示学习。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，显著减少遗忘，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: FedGTEA通过概率化任务嵌入和对齐，实现了高效、隐私保护的联邦类增量学习。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Federated Class Incremental Learning,
called Federated Gaussian Task Embedding and Alignment (FedGTEA). FedGTEA is
designed to capture task-specific knowledge and model uncertainty in a scalable
and communication-efficient manner. At the client side, the
Cardinality-Agnostic Task Encoder (CATE) produces Gaussian-distributed task
embeddings that encode task knowledge, address statistical heterogeneity, and
quantify data uncertainty. Importantly, CATE maintains a fixed parameter size
regardless of the number of tasks, which ensures scalability across long task
sequences. On the server side, FedGTEA utilizes the 2-Wasserstein distance to
measure inter-task gaps between Gaussian embeddings. We formulate the
Wasserstein loss to enforce inter-task separation. This probabilistic
formulation not only enhances representation learning but also preserves
task-level privacy by avoiding the direct transmission of latent embeddings,
aligning with the privacy constraints in federated learning. Extensive
empirical evaluations on popular datasets demonstrate that FedGTEA achieves
superior classification performance and significantly mitigates forgetting,
consistently outperforming strong existing baselines.

TL;DR: OIMs结合EP在物理硬件上实现高效学习，达到竞争性准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用物理系统的能量下降特性加速机器学习，避免传统处理器的瓶颈。

Method: 使用OIMs和EP，通过局部学习规则实现能量下降和优化。

Result: 在MNIST和Fashion-MNIST上分别达到97.2%和88.0%的准确率，且对硬件噪声鲁棒。

Conclusion: OIMs为神经形态学习提供了快速、节能的硬件实现途径。

Abstract: Physical systems that naturally perform energy descent offer a direct route
to accelerating machine learning. Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) exemplify
this idea: their GHz-frequency dynamics mirror both the optimization of
energy-based models (EBMs) and gradient descent on loss landscapes, while
intrinsic noise corresponds to Langevin dynamics - supporting sampling as well
as optimization. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) unifies these processes into
descent on a single total energy landscape, enabling local learning rules
without global backpropagation. We show that EP on OIMs achieves competitive
accuracy ($\sim 97.2 \pm 0.1 \%$ on MNIST, $\sim 88.0 \pm 0.1 \%$ on
Fashion-MNIST), while maintaining robustness under realistic hardware
constraints such as parameter quantization and phase noise. These results
establish OIMs as a fast, energy-efficient substrate for neuromorphic learning,
and suggest that EBMs - often bottlenecked by conventional processors - may
find practical realization on physical hardware whose dynamics directly perform
their optimization.

Motivation: 研究剪枝在对抗性强化学习中的作用，填补理论空白，并探索性能与鲁棒性的平衡。

Method: 开发了首个理论框架，用于在状态对抗马尔可夫决策过程（SA-MDPs）中验证剪枝的鲁棒性，分析了高斯和分类策略。

Result: 剪枝在中等稀疏水平下显著提升鲁棒性，且不影响甚至提升干净任务性能。

Conclusion: 剪枝不仅是压缩工具，还可作为提升强化学习鲁棒性的结构性干预手段。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in real-world environments must
remain reliable under adversarial perturbations. At the same time, modern deep
RL agents are heavily over-parameterized, raising costs and fragility concerns.
While pruning has been shown to improve robustness in supervised learning, its
role in adversarial RL remains poorly understood. We develop the first
theoretical framework for certified robustness under pruning in
state-adversarial Markov decision processes (SA-MDPs). For Gaussian and
categorical policies with Lipschitz networks, we prove that element-wise
pruning can only tighten certified robustness bounds; pruning never makes the
policy less robust. Building on this, we derive a novel three-term regret
decomposition that disentangles clean-task performance, pruning-induced
performance loss, and robustness gains, exposing a fundamental
performance--robustness frontier. Empirically, we evaluate magnitude and
micro-pruning schedules on continuous-control benchmarks with strong
policy-aware adversaries. Across tasks, pruning consistently uncovers
reproducible ``sweet spots'' at moderate sparsity levels, where robustness
improves substantially without harming - and sometimes even enhancing - clean
performance. These results position pruning not merely as a compression tool
but as a structural intervention for robust RL.

Conclusion: 该框架有助于在医疗AI中进行可重复和协作的隐私评估。

Abstract: Foundation models trained on large-scale de-identified electronic health

to memorize patient information raises important privacy concerns. In this
work, we introduce a suite of black-box evaluation tests to assess
privacy-related memorization risks in foundation models trained on structured
EHR data. Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the
embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model
generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We
contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient
privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups. We validate our approach on a
publicly available EHR foundation model and release an open-source toolkit to
facilitate reproducible and collaborative privacy assessments in healthcare AI.

Abstract: Standard benchmark datasets, such as MNIST, often fail to expose latent
biases and multimodal feature complexities, limiting the trustworthiness of
deep neural networks in high-stakes applications. We propose a novel multimodal

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拒绝推断方法假设拒绝客户行为可从接受客户外推，忽略了分布差异，导致偏差。

Method: 使用异常检测模型识别拒绝客户分布，结合监督分类模型分配标签。

Result: 在真实信贷数据集上验证，CI-EX在RI特定指标上优于现有方法，AUC表现竞争性。

Conclusion: CI-EX在拒绝推断中平衡AUC与RI指标，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reject Inference (RI) methods aim to address sample bias by inferring missing
repayment data for rejected credit applicants. Traditional approaches often
assume that the behavior of rejected clients can be extrapolated from accepted
clients, despite potential distributional differences between the two
populations. To mitigate this blind extrapolation, we propose a novel Confident
Inlier Extrapolation framework (CI-EX). CI-EX iteratively identifies the
distribution of rejected client samples using an outlier detection model and
assigns labels to rejected individuals closest to the distribution of the
accepted population based on probabilities derived from a supervised
classification model. The effectiveness of our proposed framework is validated
through experiments on two large real-world credit datasets. Performance is
evaluated using the Area Under the Curve (AUC) as well as RI-specific metrics
such as Kickout and a novel metric introduced in this work, denoted as Area
under the Kickout. Our findings reveal that RI methods, including the proposed
framework, generally involve a trade-off between AUC and RI-specific metrics.
However, the proposed CI-EX framework consistently outperforms existing RI
models from the credit literature in terms of RI-specific metrics while
maintaining competitive performance in AUC across most experiments.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在准确性和内存占用上优于现有方法，适用于大规模和量化场景。

Conclusion: 去噪分数匹配损失是一种高效且可扩展的LID估计器。

Abstract: The local intrinsic dimension (LID) of data is a fundamental quantity in
signal processing and learning theory, but quantifying the LID of
high-dimensional, complex data has been a historically challenging task. Recent
works have discovered that diffusion models capture the LID of data through the
spectra of their score estimates and through the rate of change of their
density estimates under various noise perturbations. While these methods can
accurately quantify LID, they require either many forward passes of the
diffusion model or use of gradient computation, limiting their applicability in
compute- and memory-constrained scenarios.
  We show that the LID is a lower bound on the denoising score matching loss,
motivating use of the denoising score matching loss as a LID estimator.
Moreover, we show that the equivalent implicit score matching loss also
approximates LID via the normal dimension and is closely related to a recent
LID estimator, FLIPD. Our experiments on a manifold benchmark and with Stable
Diffusion 3.5 indicate that the denoising score matching loss is a highly
competitive and scalable LID estimator, achieving superior accuracy and memory
footprint under increasing problem size and quantization level.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遗忘度量依赖参考响应或分类器输出，无法全面评估模型是否真正遗忘，存在系统性盲点。

Method: 提出FADE度量，通过比较未学习模型与参考模型在生成样本上的双向似然分配，评估分布相似性。

Result: 实验表明，传统度量下表现优异的方法在FADE下未能实现分布等价，甚至比遗忘前更偏离黄金标准。

Conclusion: FADE为开发真正有效的遗忘方法提供了更稳健的评估基础，揭示了当前评估实践的根本缺陷。

Abstract: Current unlearning metrics for generative models evaluate success based on
reference responses or classifier outputs rather than assessing the core
objective: whether the unlearned model behaves indistinguishably from a model
that never saw the unwanted data. This reference-specific approach creates
systematic blind spots, allowing models to appear successful while retaining
unwanted knowledge accessible through alternative prompts or attacks. We
address these limitations by proposing Functional Alignment for Distributional
Equivalence (FADE), a novel metric that measures distributional similarity
between unlearned and reference models by comparing bidirectional likelihood
assignments over generated samples. Unlike existing approaches that rely on
predetermined references, FADE captures functional alignment across the entire
output distribution, providing a principled assessment of genuine unlearning.
Our experiments on the TOFU benchmark for LLM unlearning and the UnlearnCanvas
benchmark for text-to-image diffusion model unlearning reveal that methods
achieving near-optimal scores on traditional metrics fail to achieve
distributional equivalence, with many becoming more distant from the gold
standard than before unlearning. These findings expose fundamental gaps in
current evaluation practices and demonstrate that FADE provides a more robust
foundation for developing and assessing truly effective unlearning methods.

Conclusion: CSI-4CAST在CSI预测中表现出色，同时公开数据集和评估协议以促进研究。

Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) prediction is a promising strategy for
ensuring reliable and efficient operation of massive multiple-input
multiple-output (mMIMO) systems by providing timely downlink (DL) CSI. While
deep learning-based methods have advanced beyond conventional model-driven and
statistical approaches, they remain limited in robustness to practical
non-Gaussian noise, generalization across diverse channel conditions, and
computational efficiency. This paper introduces CSI-4CAST, a hybrid deep
learning architecture that integrates 4 key components, i.e., Convolutional
neural network residuals, Adaptive correction layers, ShuffleNet blocks, and
Transformers, to efficiently capture both local and long-range dependencies in
CSI prediction. To enable rigorous evaluation, this work further presents a
comprehensive benchmark, CSI-RRG for Regular, Robustness and Generalization
testing, which includes more than 300,000 samples across 3,060 realistic
scenarios for both TDD and FDD systems. The dataset spans multiple channel
models, a wide range of delay spreads and user velocities, and diverse noise
types and intensity degrees. Experimental results show that CSI-4CAST achieves
superior prediction accuracy with substantially lower computational cost,
outperforming baselines in 88.9% of TDD scenarios and 43.8% of FDD scenario,
the best performance among all evaluated models, while reducing FLOPs by 5x and
3x compared to LLM4CP, the strongest baseline. In addition, evaluation over
CSI-RRG provides valuable insights into how different channel factors affect
the performance and generalization capability of deep learning models. Both the
dataset (https://huggingface.co/CSI-4CAST) and evaluation protocols
(https://github.com/AI4OPT/CSI-4CAST) are publicly released to establish a
standardized benchmark and to encourage further research on robust and
efficient CSI prediction.

Result: LLMs在极值问题上的推理能力与现有数学基准测试结果不一致，表明现有评估方法不全面。

Conclusion: 现有数学基准测试未能全面捕捉LLMs的数学推理能力，需改进评估方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) with remarkable
reasoning capabilities, particularly in mathematical domains, through
intermediate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before generating final answers.
However, the specific sources and mechanisms underlying these reasoning
capabilities remain insufficiently understood. Optimization reasoning, i.e.
finding extrema under constraints, represents a fundamental abstraction that
underpins critical applications in planning, control, resource allocation, and
prompt search. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce
ExtremBench, a benchmark dataset for solving mathematical extremal problems,
curated from inequality exercises used for Chinese Mathematical Olympiad and
transformed into $93$ standardized extrema-finding problems. We conduct
extensive evaluations across various state-of-the-art open-source model
families, including the Qwen3, GPT-OSS, and DeepSeek. Our results reveal that
LLMs' extremal-solving reasoning capabilities do not always align with those of
current mathematical benchmarks such as AIME25 and MATH-500, with some models
showing strong general mathematical reasoning but poor extremal-solving skills,
and vice versa. This discrepancy highlights a critical gap in current
evaluation practices and suggests that existing benchmarks may not
comprehensively capture the full spectrum of mathematical reasoning abilities.

Conclusion: AMORE是一个通用框架，不仅适用于DeepONet，还可扩展至其他算子网络，为未来CFD研究提供了基础。

Abstract: Time integration of stiff systems is a primary source of computational cost
in combustion, hypersonics, and other reactive transport systems. This
stiffness can introduce time scales significantly smaller than those associated
with other physical processes, requiring extremely small time steps in explicit
schemes or computationally intensive implicit methods. Consequently, strategies
to alleviate challenges posed by stiffness are important. While neural
operators (DeepONets) can act as surrogates for stiff kinetics, a reliable
operator learning strategy is required to appropriately account for differences
in the error between output variables and samples. Here, we develop AMORE,
Adaptive Multi-Output Operator Network, a framework comprising an operator
capable of predicting multiple outputs and adaptive loss functions ensuring
reliable operator learning. The operator predicts all thermochemical states
from given initial conditions. We propose two adaptive loss functions within
the framework, considering each state variable's and sample's error to penalize
the loss function. We designed the trunk to automatically satisfy Partition of
Unity. To enforce unity mass-fraction constraint exactly, we propose an
invertible analytical map that transforms the $n$-dimensional species
mass-fraction vector into an ($n-1$)-dimensional space, where DeepONet training
is performed. We consider two-step training for DeepONet for multiple outputs
and extend adaptive loss functions for trunk and branch training. We
demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of our models through two examples:
the syngas (12 states) and GRI-Mech 3.0 (24 active states out of 54). The
proposed DeepONet will be a backbone for future CFD studies to accelerate
turbulent combustion simulations. AMORE is a general framework, and here, in
addition to DeepONet, we also demonstrate it for FNO.

Conclusion: 多阶段强化学习算法通过良好初始化和优化策略，有效解决了局部最优问题，提升了单细胞扰动建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling cellular responses to genetic and chemical perturbations remains a
central challenge in single-cell biology. Existing data-driven framework have
advanced perturbation prediction through variational autoencoders, chemically
conditioned autoencoders, and large-scale transformer pretraining. However,
these models are prone to local optima in the nonconvex Waddington landscape of
cell fate decisions, where poor initialization can trap trajectories in
spurious lineages or implausible differentiation outcomes. While executable
gene regulatory networks complement these approaches, automated design
frameworks incorporate biological priors through multi-agent optimization. Yet,
an approach that is completely data-driven with well-designed initialization to
escape local optima and converge to a proper lineage remains elusive. In this
work, we introduce a multistage reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for
single-cell perturbation modeling. We first compute an explicit natural
gradient update using Fisher-vector products and a conjugate gradient solver,
scaled by a KL trust-region constraint to provide a safe, curvature-aware the
first step for the policy. Starting with these preconditioned parameters, we
then apply a second phase of proximal policy optimization (PPO) with clipped
surrogates, exploiting minibatch efficiency to refine the policy. We
demonstrate that this initialization substantially improves generalization on
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and Single-cell ATAC sequencing
(scATAC-seq) pertubation analysis.

Conclusion: 该框架为工业环境中的焊接检测提供了可行的端到端解决方案。

Abstract: Automated ultrasonic weld inspection remains a significant challenge in the
nondestructive evaluation (NDE) community to factors such as limited training
data (due to the complexity of curating experimental specimens or high-fidelity
simulations) and environmental volatility of many industrial settings
(resulting in the corruption of on-the-fly measurements). Thus, an end-to-end
machine learning (ML) workflow for acoustic weld inspection in realistic (i.e.,
industrial) settings has remained an elusive goal. This work addresses the
challenges of data curation and signal corruption by proposing workflow
consisting of a reduced-order modeling scheme, diffusion based distribution
alignment, and U-Net-based segmentation and inversion. A reduced-order
Helmholtz model based on Lamb wave theory is used to generate a comprehensive
dataset over varying weld heterogeneity and crack defects. The relatively
inexpensive low-order solutions provide a robust training dateset for inversion
models which are refined through a transfer learning stage using a limited set
of full 3D elastodynamic simulations. To handle out-of-distribution (OOD)
real-world measurements with varying and unpredictable noise distributions,
i.e., Laser Doppler Vibrometry scans, guided diffusion produces in-distribution
representations of OOD experimental LDV scans which are subsequently processed
by the inversion models. This integrated framework provides an end-to-end
solution for automated weld inspection on real data.

Result: 在多种动态系统中验证了方法的有效性，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过信息论视角优化Koopman学习，实现了更稳定和可解释的表示。

Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for modeling dynamical
systems and has attracted growing interest from the machine learning community.
However, its infinite-dimensional nature makes identifying suitable
finite-dimensional subspaces challenging, especially for deep architectures. We
argue that these difficulties come from suboptimal representation learning,
where latent variables fail to balance expressivity and simplicity. This
tension is closely related to the information bottleneck (IB) dilemma:
constructing compressed representations that are both compact and predictive.
Rethinking Koopman learning through this lens, we demonstrate that latent
mutual information promotes simplicity, yet an overemphasis on simplicity may
cause latent space to collapse onto a few dominant modes. In contrast,
expressiveness is sustained by the von Neumann entropy, which prevents such
collapse and encourages mode diversity. This insight leads us to propose an
information-theoretic Lagrangian formulation that explicitly balances this
tradeoff. Furthermore, we propose a new algorithm based on the Lagrangian
formulation that encourages both simplicity and expressiveness, leading to a
stable and interpretable Koopman representation. Beyond quantitative
evaluations, we further visualize the learned manifolds under our
representations, observing empirical results consistent with our theoretical
predictions. Finally, we validate our approach across a diverse range of
dynamical systems, demonstrating improved performance over existing Koopman
learning methods. The implementation is publicly available at

TL;DR: 开发了一个可解释的AI框架，通过结合高分辨率操作模型和理想化模型的优势，显著提升了地球系统模拟的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率操作模型在模拟极端事件和统计分布时存在偏差，而理想化模型虽能精确校准但受限于学科边界。

Method: 利用重新配置的潜在数据同化技术，结合不同复杂度模型的互补优势，构建了一个桥接模型。

Result: 桥接模型继承了操作模型的高分辨率和全面变量，同时通过理想化模型的针对性改进提升了全局准确性。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅提供了物理洞察，还支持高效的计算，为物理辅助数字孪生和不确定性量化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system.
While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they
exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and
statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate
fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in
characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different
models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the
complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an
explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model
hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely
suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting
bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of
operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through
targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI
provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box
correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally
efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and
uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly
correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Ni\~no spatiotemporal patterns,
leveraging statistically accurate idealized models. This work also highlights
the importance of pushing idealized model development and advancing
communication between modeling communities.

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上表现优于经典优化器。

Conclusion: IAGD和NRSGD是SGD的有效改进方法。

Abstract: Based on Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), the paper introduces two
optimizers, named Interpolational Accelerating Gradient Descent (IAGD) as well
as Noise-Regularized Stochastic Gradient Descent (NRSGD). IAGD leverages
second-order Newton Interpolation to expedite the convergence process during
training, assuming relevancy in gradients between iterations. To avoid
over-fitting, NRSGD incorporates a noise regularization technique that
introduces controlled noise to the gradients during the optimization process.
Comparative experiments of this research are conducted on the CIFAR-10, and
CIFAR-100 datasets, benchmarking different CNNs(Convolutional Neural Networks)
with IAGD and NRSGD against classical optimizers in Keras Package. Results
demonstrate the potential of those two viable improvement methods in SGD,
implicating the effectiveness of the advancements.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全球南方地区因雷达覆盖稀疏而无法使用传统或现有机器学习降水预报方法的问题。

Method: 结合Global Precipitation Mission的CORRA数据集、地球静止卫星数据和全球NWP数据，预测未来12小时的降水。

Result: 模型在空间和时间分辨率上表现优异，显著提升预测准确性，适用于实时应用。

Conclusion: Global MetNet减少了全球预报质量的不平等，并成功整合了稀疏的高分辨率卫星观测数据。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting, which predicts rainfall up to a few hours ahead, is
a critical tool for vulnerable communities in the Global South frequently
exposed to intense, rapidly developing storms. Timely forecasts provide a
crucial window to protect lives and livelihoods. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) methods suffer from high latency, low spatial and temporal
resolution, and significant gaps in accuracy across the world. Recent machine
learning-based nowcasting methods, common in the Global North, cannot be
extended to the Global South due to extremely sparse radar coverage. We present
Global MetNet, an operational global machine learning nowcasting model. It
leverages the Global Precipitation Mission's CORRA dataset, geostationary
satellite data, and global NWP data to predict precipitation for the next 12
hours. The model operates at a high resolution of approximately 0.05{\deg}
(~5km) spatially and 15 minutes temporally. Global MetNet significantly
outperforms industry-standard hourly forecasts and achieves significantly
higher skill, making forecasts useful over a much larger area of the world than
previously available. Our model demonstrates better skill in data-sparse
regions than even the best high-resolution NWP models achieve in the US.
Validated using ground radar and satellite data, it shows significant
improvements across key metrics like the critical success index and fractions
skill score for all precipitation rates and lead times. Crucially, our model
generates forecasts in under a minute, making it readily deployable for
real-time applications. It is already deployed for millions of users on Google
Search. This work represents a key step in reducing global disparities in
forecast quality and integrating sparse, high-resolution satellite observations
into weather forecasting.

Motivation: 研究动态环境中决策问题，通过时间变化优化视角处理流数据学习问题。

Method: 引入基于权重的结构化公式，分析均匀权重和折扣权重策略下的梯度下降跟踪误差。

Result: 均匀权重下跟踪误差以$\mathcal{O}(1/t)$速率渐近消失，折扣权重下存在非零误差下限。

Conclusion: 理论分析通过数值模拟验证，为动态优化问题提供了新视角和工具。

Abstract: Classical optimization theory deals with fixed, time-invariant objective
functions. However, time-varying optimization has emerged as an important
subject for decision-making in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the
problem of learning from streaming data through a time-varying optimization
lens. Unlike prior works that focus on generic formulations, we introduce a
structured, \emph{weight-based} formulation that explicitly captures the
streaming-data origin of the time-varying objective, where at each time step,
an agent aims to minimize a weighted average loss over all the past data
samples. We focus on two specific weighting strategies: (1) uniform weights,
which treat all samples equally, and (2) discounted weights, which
geometrically decay the influence of older data. For both schemes, we derive
tight bounds on the ``tracking error'' (TE), defined as the deviation between
the model parameter and the time-varying optimum at a given time step, under
gradient descent (GD) updates. We show that under uniform weighting, the TE
vanishes asymptotically with a $\mathcal{O}(1/t)$ decay rate, whereas
discounted weighting incurs a nonzero error floor controlled by the discount
factor and the number of gradient updates performed at each time step. Our
theoretical findings are validated through numerical simulations.

Result: 两种算法在KL正则化强度β下实现了对数级后悔，同时保持了标准√T后悔。

Conclusion: KL正则化在博弈论环境中能显著提升样本效率，理论分析支持其实际应用价值。

Abstract: Reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization with respect to
a fixed reference policy is widely used in modern reinforcement learning to
preserve the desired traits of the reference policy and sometimes to promote
exploration (using uniform reference policy, known as entropy regularization).
Beyond serving as a mere anchor, the reference policy can also be interpreted
as encoding prior knowledge about good actions in the environment. In the
context of alignment, recent game-theoretic approaches have leveraged KL
regularization with pretrained language models as reference policies, achieving
notable empirical success in self-play methods. Despite these advances, the
theoretical benefits of KL regularization in game-theoretic settings remain
poorly understood. In this work, we develop and analyze algorithms that
provably achieve improved sample efficiency under KL regularization. We study
both two-player zero-sum Matrix games and Markov games: for Matrix games, we
propose OMG, an algorithm based on best response sampling with optimistic
bonuses, and extend this idea to Markov games through the algorithm SOMG, which
also uses best response sampling and a novel concept of superoptimistic
bonuses. Both algorithms achieve a logarithmic regret in $T$ that scales
inversely with the KL regularization strength $\beta$ in addition to the
standard $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret independent of $\beta$
which is attained in both regularized and unregularized settings

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了新指数的性能，并与其他广泛使用的聚类有效性指数进行了比较。

Conclusion: 新指数能够有效评估聚类的紧凑性和分离性，并确定真实聚类数量。

Abstract: Finding "true" clusters in a data set is a challenging problem. Clustering
solutions obtained using different models and algorithms do not necessarily
provide compact and well-separated clusters or the optimal number of clusters.
Cluster validity indices are commonly applied to identify such clusters.
Nevertheless, these indices are typically relative, and they are used to
compare clustering algorithms or choose the parameters of a clustering
algorithm. Moreover, the success of these indices depends on the underlying
data structure. This paper introduces novel absolute cluster indices to
determine both the compactness and separability of clusters. We define a
compactness function for each cluster and a set of neighboring points for
cluster pairs. This function is utilized to determine the compactness of each
cluster and the whole cluster distribution. The set of neighboring points is
used to define the margin between clusters and the overall distribution margin.
The proposed compactness and separability indices are applied to identify the
true number of clusters. Using a number of synthetic and real-world data sets,
we demonstrate the performance of these new indices and compare them with other
widely-used cluster validity indices.

Conclusion: NeuroRVQ为基于代码本的通用脑电模型提供了强大先验，推动了神经解码和生成建模的进展。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) captures neural activity across multiple
temporal and spectral scales, yielding signals that are rich but complex for
representation learning. Recently, EEG foundation models trained to predict
masked signal-tokens have shown promise for learning generalizable
representations. However, their performance is hindered by their signal
tokenization modules. Existing neural tokenizers fail to preserve
high-frequency dynamics, limiting their ability to reconstruct EEG signals with
high fidelity. We introduce NeuroRVQ, a scalable Large Brainwave Model (LBM)
centered on a codebook-based tokenizer. Our tokenizer integrates: (i)
multi-scale feature extraction modules that capture the full frequency neural
spectrum; (ii) hierarchical residual vector quantization (RVQ) codebooks for
high-resolution encoding; and, (iii) an EEG signal phase- and amplitude-aware
loss function for efficient training. This design enables efficient EEG
compression while supporting accurate reconstruction across all frequency
bands, leading to robust generative masked modeling. Our empirical results
demonstrate that NeuroRVQ achieves lower reconstruction error and outperforms
existing LBMs on a variety of downstream tasks. More broadly, NeuroRVQ
tokenizer establishes a strong prior for codebook-based general-purpose
brainwave models, enabling advances in neural decoding, generative modeling and
multimodal biosignal integration.

Result: 在低到中SNR下优于现有基线，高SNR时接近WMMSE性能，且推理速度显著快于迭代和在线学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在性能和效率上均表现出色，适用于动态通信环境。

Abstract: We develop an unsupervised deep learning framework for downlink beamforming
in large-scale MU-MISO channels. The model is trained offline, allowing
real-time inference through lightweight feedforward computations in dynamic
communication environments. Following the learning-to-optimize (L2O) paradigm,
a multi-layer Transformer iteratively refines both channel and beamformer
features via residual connections. To enhance training, three strategies are
introduced: (i) curriculum learning (CL) to improve early-stage convergence and
avoid local optima, (ii) semi-amortized learning to refine each Transformer
block with a few gradient ascent steps, and (iii) sliding-window training to
stabilize optimization by training only a subset of Transformer blocks at a
time. Extensive simulations show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
baselines at low-to-medium SNRs and closely approaches WMMSE performance at
high SNRs, while achieving substantially faster inference than iterative and
online learning approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统营销组合建模方法（如线性回归或贝叶斯分层模型）难以捕捉营销渠道间的复杂依赖关系和非线性效应。

Method: 使用GRU学习时间模式（如广告库存效应和滞后效应），结合DAG学习因果结构，并采用Hill方程建模饱和效应。

Result: 实现了数据驱动的超参数学习、多区域建模、鲁棒统计方法和丰富的可视化工具。

Conclusion: DeepCausalMMM提供了更灵活、准确的营销效果分析工具，支持数据驱动的决策优化。

Abstract: Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) is a statistical technique used to estimate the
impact of marketing activities on business outcomes such as sales, revenue, or
customer visits. Traditional MMM approaches often rely on linear regression or
Bayesian hierarchical models that assume independence between marketing
channels and struggle to capture complex temporal dynamics and non-linear
saturation effects [@Hanssens2005; @Ng2021Bayesian].
  DeepCausalMMM is a Python package that addresses these limitations by
combining deep learning, causal inference, and advanced marketing science. The
package uses Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to automatically learn temporal
patterns such as adstock (carryover effects) and lag, while simultaneously
learning statistical dependencies and potential causal structures between
marketing channels through Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) learning
[@Zheng2018NOTEARS; @Gong2024CausalMMM]. Additionally, it implements Hill
equation-based saturation curves to model diminishing returns and optimize
budget allocation.
  Key innovations include: (1) a data-driven design where hyperparameters and
transformations (e.g., adstock decay, saturation curves) are learned or
estimated from data with sensible defaults, rather than requiring fixed
heuristics or manual specification, (2) multi-region modeling with both shared
and region-specific parameters, (3) robust statistical methods including Huber
loss and advanced regularization, (4) comprehensive response curve analysis for
understanding channel saturation, and (5) an extensive visualization suite with
14+ interactive dashboards for business insights.

Conclusion: 稀疏三角传输映射在保持表达能力和可逆性的同时，显著提高了计算效率，为大规模格点场理论采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: Lattice field theories are fundamental testbeds for computational physics;
yet, sampling their Boltzmann distributions remains challenging due to
multimodality and long-range correlations. While normalizing flows offer a
promising alternative, their application to large lattices is often constrained
by prohibitive memory requirements and the challenge of maintaining sufficient
model expressivity. We propose sparse triangular transport maps that explicitly
exploit the conditional independence structure of the lattice graph under
periodic boundary conditions using monotone rectified neural networks (MRNN).
We introduce a comprehensive framework for triangular transport maps that
navigates the fundamental trade-off between \emph{exact sparsity} (respecting
marginal conditional independence in the target distribution) and
\emph{approximate sparsity} (computational tractability without fill-ins).
Restricting each triangular map component to a local past enables site-wise
parallel evaluation and linear time complexity in lattice size $N$, while
preserving the expressive, invertible structure. Using $\phi^4$ in two
dimensions as a controlled setting, we analyze how node labelings (orderings)
affect the sparsity and performance of triangular maps. We compare against
Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) and established flow approaches (RealNVP).

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) for text offer a compelling alternative to
traditional autoregressive language models. Parallel generation makes them
efficient, but their computational capabilities and the limitations inherent to
their parallelism remain largely unexplored. To this end, we characterize what
types of reasoning problems MDMs can provably solve and how efficiently. We do
this by connecting MDMs to the well-understood reasoning frameworks of chain of
thought (CoT) and padded looped transformers (PLTs) in the finite-precision
log-width setting: We show that MDMs and polynomially-padded PLTs are, in fact,
equivalent in this setting, and that MDMs can solve all problems that
CoT-augmented transformers can. Moreover, we showcase classes of problems
(including regular languages) for which MDMs are inherently more efficient than
CoT transformers, where parallel generation allows for substantially faster
reasoning.

Abstract: We study the client selection problem in Federated Learning (FL) within

framework designed to reduce the total required time via cluster-based client
selection and dependent task assignment. Our approach considers Earth Mover's
Distance (EMD) for client clustering based on their local data distributions to
lower computational cost and improve communication efficiency. We derive a
direct and explicit relationship between intra-cluster EMD and the number of
training rounds required for convergence, thereby simplifying the otherwise
complex process of obtaining the optimal solution. Additionally, we incorporate
a directed acyclic graph-based task scheduling mechanism to effectively manage
task dependencies. Through numerical experiments, we validate that our proposed
CoDa-FL outperforms existing benchmarks by achieving faster convergence, lower

Abstract: We study dropout regularization in continuous-time models through the lens of
random-batch methods -- a family of stochastic sampling schemes originally
devised to reduce the computational cost of interacting particle systems. We
construct an unbiased, well-posed estimator that mimics dropout by sampling
neuron batches over time intervals of length $h$. Trajectory-wise convergence
is established with linear rate in $h$ for the expected uniform error. At the
distribution level, we establish stability for the associated continuity
equation, with total-variation error of order $h^{1/2}$ under mild moment
assumptions. During training with fixed batch sampling across epochs, a
Pontryagin-based adjoint analysis bounds deviations in the optimal cost and
control, as well as in gradient-descent iterates. On the design side, we
compare convergence rates for canonical batch sampling schemes, recover
standard Bernoulli dropout as a special case, and derive a cost--accuracy
trade-off yielding a closed-form optimal $h$. We then specialize to a
single-layer neural ODE and validate the theory on classification and flow
matching, observing the predicted rates, regularization effects, and favorable
runtime and memory profiles.

Conclusion: 准动态框架有效平衡了效率与性能，为程序表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a
fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance
compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static
representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR),
are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program
will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic
representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights
into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks
due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends
this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program
representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization
sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation
generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization
sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To
effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a
compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize
the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words.
Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to
learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive
experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass
Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: 该框架为构建高效且实用的完全等变GNN提供了理论基础和实际解决方案。

Abstract: Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant
success across various applications. To achieve completeness -- that is, the
universal approximation property over the space of equivariant functions -- the
network must effectively capture the intricate multi-body interactions among
different nodes. Prior methods attain this via deeper architectures, augmented
body orders, or increased degrees of steerable features, often at high
computational cost and without polynomial-time solutions. In this work, we
present a theoretically grounded framework for constructing complete
equivariant GNNs that is both efficient and practical. We prove that a complete
equivariant GNN can be achieved through two key components: 1) a complete
scalar function, referred to as the canonical form of the geometric graph; and
2) a full-rank steerable basis set. Leveraging this finding, we propose an
efficient algorithm for constructing complete equivariant GNNs based on two
common models: EGNN and TFN. Empirical results demonstrate that our model
demonstrates superior completeness and excellent performance with only a few
layers, thereby significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining
strong practical efficacy.

Result: 理论和实验均支持CCH假设，为选择最优教师模态提供了实用准则。

Conclusion: 研究建立了跨模态知识蒸馏的理论框架，并基于CCH准则提出了优化方法。

Abstract: The rapid increase in multimodal data availability has sparked significant
interest in cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) techniques, where richer
"teacher" modalities transfer information to weaker "student" modalities during
model training to improve performance. However, despite successes across
various applications, cross-modal KD does not always result in improved
outcomes, primarily due to a limited theoretical understanding that could
inform practice. To address this gap, we introduce the Cross-modal
Complementarity Hypothesis (CCH): we propose that cross-modal KD is effective
when the mutual information between teacher and student representations exceeds
the mutual information between the student representation and the labels. We
theoretically validate the CCH in a joint Gaussian model and further confirm it
empirically across diverse multimodal datasets, including image, text, video,
audio, and cancer-related omics data. Our study establishes a novel theoretical
framework for understanding cross-modal KD and offers practical guidelines
based on the CCH criterion to select optimal teacher modalities for improving
the performance of weaker modalities.

TL;DR: CleverCatch是一种结合领域知识和弱监督的模型，用于提高医疗欺诈检测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗欺诈检测面临标签数据稀缺、欺诈手段多变和高维医疗记录的挑战，传统方法难以应对。

Method: 通过将结构化领域知识融入神经网络架构，在共享嵌入空间中联合训练规则和数据样本。

Result: 在真实数据集上，CleverCatch在AUC和召回率上分别平均提升1.3%和3.4%。

Conclusion: 嵌入专家规则不仅能提高检测准确性，还能增强透明度，适用于高风险领域如医疗欺诈检测。

Abstract: Healthcare fraud detection remains a critical challenge due to limited
availability of labeled data, constantly evolving fraud tactics, and the high
dimensionality of medical records. Traditional supervised methods are
challenged by extreme label scarcity, while purely unsupervised approaches
often fail to capture clinically meaningful anomalies. In this work, we
introduce CleverCatch, a knowledge-guided weak supervision model designed to
detect fraudulent prescription behaviors with improved accuracy and
interpretability. Our approach integrates structured domain expertise into a
neural architecture that aligns rules and data samples within a shared
embedding space. By training encoders jointly on synthetic data representing
both compliance and violation, CleverCatch learns soft rule embeddings that
generalize to complex, real-world datasets. This hybrid design enables
data-driven learning to be enhanced by domain-informed constraints, bridging
the gap between expert heuristics and machine learning. Experiments on the
large-scale real-world dataset demonstrate that CleverCatch outperforms four
state-of-the-art anomaly detection baselines, yielding average improvements of
1.3\% in AUC and 3.4\% in recall. Our ablation study further highlights the
complementary role of expert rules, confirming the adaptability of the
framework. The results suggest that embedding expert rules into the learning
process not only improves detection accuracy but also increases transparency,
offering an interpretable approach for high-stakes domains such as healthcare
fraud detection.

TL;DR: 比较Ising和QUBO编码在Boltzmann机学习中的表现，发现QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数较差，影响SGD收敛速度，而NGD能缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究不同编码（Ising和QUBO）对Boltzmann机学习的影响，揭示信息几何和收敛速度的差异。

Method: 通过固定模型、采样器和步长，比较两种编码的Fisher信息矩阵和收敛行为。

Result: QUBO编码导致Fisher信息矩阵条件数较差，SGD收敛较慢；NGD能实现相似收敛速度。

Conclusion: Ising编码更适合SGD，QUBO编码需预处理或使用NGD以优化学习效果。

Abstract: We compare Ising ({-1,+1}) and QUBO ({0,1}) encodings for Boltzmann machine
learning under a controlled protocol that fixes the model, sampler, and step
size. Exploiting the identity that the Fisher information matrix (FIM) equals
the covariance of sufficient statistics, we visualize empirical moments from
model samples and reveal systematic, representation-dependent differences. QUBO
induces larger cross terms between first- and second-order statistics, creating
more small-eigenvalue directions in the FIM and lowering spectral entropy. This
ill-conditioning explains slower convergence under stochastic gradient descent
(SGD). In contrast, natural gradient descent (NGD)-which rescales updates by
the FIM metric-achieves similar convergence across encodings due to
reparameterization invariance. Practically, for SGD-based training, the Ising
encoding provides more isotropic curvature and faster convergence; for QUBO,
centering/scaling or NGD-style preconditioning mitigates curvature pathologies.
These results clarify how representation shapes information geometry and
finite-time learning dynamics in Boltzmann machines and yield actionable
guidelines for variable encoding and preprocessing.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的数据选择方法，通过截断影响函数（TIF）评估偏好数据质量，并引入两种评分函数（SFs）来优化模型对齐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常通过外部奖励模型或现成LLMs预处理偏好数据，但很少验证单个数据点是否真正有益。论文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出TIF评估数据质量，并设计两种计算更简单的SFs，结合它们以抵消误差，形成高效的数据选择规则。

Result: 实验表明，新方法能在更少数据下实现更好的对齐性能，适用于多种LLM家族。

Conclusion: 偏好数据质量是模型相关的，新方法能更精确地选择有价值的数据，提升对齐效果。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) alignment is typically achieved through learning
from human preference comparisons, making the quality of preference data
critical to its success. Existing studies often pre-process raw training
datasets to identify valuable preference pairs using external reward models or
off-the-shelf LLMs, achieving improved overall performance but rarely examining
whether individual, selected data point is genuinely beneficial. We assess data
quality through individual influence on validation data using our newly
proposed truncated influence function (TIF), which mitigates the over-scoring
present in traditional measures and reveals that preference data quality is
inherently a property of the model. In other words, a data pair that benefits
one model may harm another. This leaves the need to improve the preference data
selection approaches to be adapting to specific models. To this end, we
introduce two candidate scoring functions (SFs) that are computationally
simpler than TIF and positively correlated with it. They are also model
dependent and can serve as potential indicators of individual data quality for
preference data selection. Furthermore, we observe that these SFs inherently
exhibit errors when compared to TIF. To this end, we combine them to offset
their diverse error sources, resulting in a simple yet effective data selection
rule that enables the models to achieve a more precise selection of valuable
preference data. We conduct experiments across diverse alignment benchmarks and
various LLM families, with results demonstrating that better alignment
performance can be achieved using less data, showing the generality of our
findings and new methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在离线或基于模型的强化学习中表现优异，但在在线无模型强化学习中尚未充分探索，主要因其对训练设置和模型设计敏感。

Method: 研究了输入条件、Actor和Critic组件共享以及时序数据切片等关键设计问题，提出了稳定的架构和训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，这些策略在完全和部分可观测任务中均表现优异，适用于向量和图像输入。

Conclusion: 研究为在线强化学习中应用Transformer提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Despite their effectiveness and popularity in offline or model-based
reinforcement learning (RL), transformers remain underexplored in online
model-free RL due to their sensitivity to training setups and model design
decisions such as how to structure the policy and value networks, share
components, or handle temporal information. In this paper, we show that
transformers can be strong baselines for continuous control in online
model-free RL. We investigate key design questions: how to condition inputs,
share components between actor and critic, and slice sequential data for
training. Our experiments reveal stable architectural and training strategies
enabling competitive performance across fully and partially observable tasks,
and in both vector- and image-based settings. These findings offer practical
guidance for applying transformers in online RL.

TL;DR: FracNet通过频域分析和对比学习解决GNN在领域适应中的结构分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN方法在处理领域适应时未区分全局和局部模式，导致局部细节丢失。

Method: FracNet通过频域分解将图分为高频和低频成分，并结合对比学习框架。

Result: 实验证明FracNet在领域适应任务中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FracNet通过频域分析和对比学习有效解决了GNN的领域适应问题。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in various
domains, yet they often struggle with domain adaptation due to significant
structural distribution shifts and insufficient exploration of transferable
patterns. One of the main reasons behind this is that traditional approaches do
not treat global and local patterns discriminatingly so that some local details
in the graph may be violated after multi-layer GNN. Our key insight is that
domain shifts can be better understood through spectral analysis, where
low-frequency components often encode domain-invariant global patterns, and
high-frequency components capture domain-specific local details. As such, we
propose FracNet (\underline{\textbf{Fr}}equency \underline{\textbf{A}}ware
\underline{\textbf{C}}ontrastive Graph \underline{\textbf{Net}}work) with two
synergic modules to decompose the original graph into high-frequency and
low-frequency components and perform frequency-aware domain adaption. Moreover,
the blurring boundary problem of domain adaptation is improved by integrating
with a contrastive learning framework. Besides the practical implication, we
also provide rigorous theoretical proof to demonstrate the superiority of
FracNet. Extensive experiments further demonstrate significant improvements
over state-of-the-art approaches.

detection, while also making use of considerably fewer parameters. Our solution
is architecture-agnostic and can be applied to a wide range of base models out

Result: 在三个分类任务中，BlendFL表现优于现有方法，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: BlendFL在现实场景中处理多模态数据异构性方面具有潜力，特别适用于需要数据隐私的领域。

Abstract: One of the key challenges of collaborative machine learning, without data
sharing, is multimodal data heterogeneity in real-world settings. While
Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across multiple clients,
existing frameworks, such as horizontal and vertical FL, are only effective in
`ideal' settings that meet specific assumptions. Hence, they struggle to
address scenarios where neither all modalities nor all samples are represented
across the participating clients. To address this gap, we propose BlendFL, a
novel FL framework that seamlessly blends the principles of horizontal and
vertical FL in a synchronized and non-restrictive fashion despite the asymmetry
across clients. Specifically, any client within BlendFL can benefit from either
of the approaches, or both simultaneously, according to its available dataset.
In addition, BlendFL features a decentralized inference mechanism, empowering
clients to run collaboratively trained local models using available local data,
thereby reducing latency and reliance on central servers for inference. We also
introduce BlendAvg, an adaptive global model aggregation strategy that
prioritizes collaborative model updates based on each client's performance. We
trained and evaluated BlendFL and other state-of-the-art baselines on three
classification tasks using a large-scale real-world multimodal medical dataset
and a popular multimodal benchmark. Our results highlight BlendFL's superior
performance for both multimodal and unimodal classification. Ablation studies
demonstrate BlendFL's faster convergence compared to traditional approaches,
accelerating collaborative learning. Overall, in our study we highlight the
potential of BlendFL for handling multimodal data heterogeneity for
collaborative learning in real-world settings where data privacy is crucial,
such as in healthcare and finance.

Result: 在FastTD3、FastSAC和PPO等算法中，单纯形嵌入显著提升了样本效率和最终性能，且不影响运行速度。

Conclusion: 单纯形嵌入是一种有效的几何归纳偏置，能够在不增加计算成本的情况下提升RL代理的性能。

Abstract: Recent works have proposed accelerating the wall-clock training time of
actor-critic methods via the use of large-scale environment parallelization;
unfortunately, these can sometimes still require large number of environment
interactions to achieve a desired level of performance. Noting that
well-structured representations can improve the generalization and sample
efficiency of deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents, we propose the use of
simplicial embeddings: lightweight representation layers that constrain
embeddings to simplicial structures. This geometric inductive bias results in
sparse and discrete features that stabilize critic bootstrapping and strengthen
policy gradients. When applied to FastTD3, FastSAC, and PPO, simplicial
embeddings consistently improve sample efficiency and final performance across
a variety of continuous- and discrete-control environments, without any loss in
runtime speed.

Result: 实验表明，MERA在多种数据集和模型上表现优于现有基线，并能提升现有干预技术的性能。

Conclusion: MERA是一种通用且高效的机制激活干预方法，能安全、有效地减少语言模型错误。

Abstract: We introduce Mechanistic Error Reduction with Abstention (MERA), a principled
framework for steering language models (LMs) to mitigate errors through
selective, adaptive interventions. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed,
manually tuned steering strengths, often resulting in under or oversteering,
MERA addresses these limitations by (i) optimising the intervention direction,
and (ii) calibrating when, and how much to steer, thereby provably improving
performance or abstaining when no confident correction is possible. Experiments
across diverse datasets, and LM families demonstrate safe, effective,
non-degrading error correction, and that MERA outperforms existing baselines.
Moreover, MERA can be applied on top of existing steering techniques to further
enhance their performance, establishing it as a general-purpose, and efficient
approach to mechanistic activation steering.

Motivation: 联邦学习中客户端数据分布差异大，标准共形预测的i.i.d.假设不成立，现有方法无法反映输入条件不确定性。

Method: 利用生成模型（如归一化流或扩散模型）近似条件数据分布，无需共享原始数据，通过联邦聚合实现全局一致性。

Result: 实验表明Fed-CCP能生成更自适应的预测集。

Conclusion: Fed-CCP在联邦学习中实现了条件覆盖，适应本地数据异质性，同时保持全局一致性。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) provides distribution-free uncertainty
quantification by constructing prediction sets that guarantee coverage of the
true labels. This reliability makes CP valuable for high-stakes federated
learning scenarios such as multi-center healthcare. However, standard CP
assumes i.i.d. data, which is violated in federated settings where client
distributions differ substantially. Existing federated CP methods address this
by maintaining marginal coverage on each client, but such guarantees often fail
to reflect input-conditional uncertainty. In this work, we propose Federated
Conditional Conformal Prediction (Fed-CCP) via generative models, which aims
for conditional coverage that adapts to local data heterogeneity. Fed-CCP
leverages generative models, such as normalizing flows or diffusion models, to
approximate conditional data distributions without requiring the sharing of raw
data. This enables each client to locally calibrate conformal scores that
reflect its unique uncertainty, while preserving global consistency through
federated aggregation. Experiments on real datasets demonstrate that Fed-CCP
achieves more adaptive prediction sets.

Abstract: Dynamical downscaling is crucial for deriving high-resolution meteorological
fields from coarse-scale simulations, enabling detailed analysis for critical
applications such as weather forecasting and renewable energy modeling.
Generative Diffusion models (DMs) have recently emerged as powerful data-driven
tools for this task, offering reconstruction fidelity and more scalable
sampling supporting uncertainty quantification. However, DMs lack finite-sample
guarantees against overconfident predictions, resulting in miscalibrated
grid-point-level uncertainty estimates hindering their reliability in
operational contexts. In this work, we tackle this issue by augmenting the
downscaling pipeline with a conformal prediction framework. Specifically, the
DM's samples are post-processed to derive conditional quantile estimates,
incorporated into a conformalized quantile regression procedure targeting
locally adaptive prediction intervals with finite-sample marginal validity. The
proposed approach is evaluated on ERA5 reanalysis data over Italy, downscaled
to a 2-km grid. Results demonstrate grid-point-level uncertainty estimates with
markedly improved coverage and stable probabilistic scores relative to the DM
baseline, highlighting the potential of conformalized generative models for
more trustworthy probabilistic downscaling to high-resolution meteorological
fields.

Abstract: Anomaly detection is a critical task in data mining and management with
applications spanning fraud detection, network security, and log monitoring.
Despite extensive research, existing unsupervised anomaly detection methods
still face fundamental challenges including conflicting distributional
assumptions, computational inefficiency, and difficulty handling different
anomaly types. To address these problems, we propose ISER (Isolation-based
Spherical Ensemble Representations) that extends existing isolation-based
methods by using hypersphere radii as proxies for local density characteristics
while maintaining linear time and constant space complexity. ISER constructs
ensemble representations where hypersphere radii encode density information:
smaller radii indicate dense regions while larger radii correspond to sparse
areas. We introduce a novel similarity-based scoring method that measures
pattern consistency by comparing ensemble representations against a theoretical
anomaly reference pattern. Additionally, we enhance the performance of
Isolation Forest by using ISER and adapting the scoring function to address
axis-parallel bias and local anomaly detection limitations. Comprehensive
experiments on 22 real-world datasets demonstrate ISER's superior performance
over 11 baseline methods.

Abstract: As Machine Learning (ML) becomes integral to Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS),
there is growing interest in shifting training from traditional cloud-based to
on-device processing (TinyML), for example, due to privacy and latency
concerns. However, CPS often comprise ultra-low-power microcontrollers, whose
limited compute resources make training challenging. This paper presents
RockNet, a new TinyML method tailored for ultra-low-power hardware that
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in timeseries classification, such as fault
or malware detection, without requiring offline pretraining. By leveraging that
CPS consist of multiple devices, we design a distributed learning method that
integrates ML and wireless communication. RockNet leverages all devices for
distributed training of specialized compute efficient classifiers that need
minimal communication overhead for parallelization. Combined with tailored and
efficient wireless multi-hop communication protocols, our approach overcomes
the communication bottleneck that often occurs in distributed learning.
Hardware experiments on a testbed with 20 ultra-low-power devices demonstrate
RockNet's effectiveness. It successfully learns timeseries classification tasks
from scratch, surpassing the accuracy of the latest approach for neural network
microcontroller training by up to 2x. RockNet's distributed ML architecture
reduces memory, latency and energy consumption per device by up to 90 % when
scaling from one central device to 20 devices. Our results show that a tight
integration of distributed ML, distributed computing, and communication
enables, for the first time, training on ultra-low-power hardware with
state-of-the-art accuracy.

Result: 最优弃权机制能确保分类器效用不劣于非弃权场景，并可作为操纵的威慑手段，增加代理人操纵成本。

Conclusion: 弃权机制是减少算法决策中策略行为负面效应的有效工具。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision making is increasingly prevalent, but often vulnerable
to strategic manipulation by agents seeking a favorable outcome. Prior research
has shown that classifier abstention (allowing a classifier to decline making a
decision due to insufficient confidence) can significantly increase classifier
accuracy. This paper studies abstention within a strategic classification
context, exploring how its introduction impacts strategic agents' responses and
how principals should optimally leverage it. We model this interaction as a
Stackelberg game where a principal, acting as the classifier, first announces
its decision policy, and then strategic agents, acting as followers, manipulate
their features to receive a desired outcome. Here, we focus on binary
classifiers where agents manipulate observable features rather than their true
features, and show that optimal abstention ensures that the principal's utility
(or loss) is no worse than in a non-abstention setting, even in the presence of
strategic agents. We also show that beyond improving accuracy, abstention can
also serve as a deterrent to manipulation, making it costlier for agents,
especially those less qualified, to manipulate to achieve a positive outcome
when manipulation costs are significant enough to affect agent behavior. These
results highlight abstention as a valuable tool for reducing the negative
effects of strategic behavior in algorithmic decision making systems.

Abstract: Bayesian optimization in large unstructured discrete spaces is often hindered
by the computational cost of maximizing acquisition functions due to the
absence of gradients. We propose a scalable alternative based on Thompson
sampling that eliminates the need for acquisition function maximization by
directly parameterizing the probability that a candidate yields the maximum
reward. Our approach, Thompson Sampling via Fine-Tuning (ToSFiT) leverages the
prior knowledge embedded in prompt-conditioned large language models, and
incrementally adapts them toward the posterior. Theoretically, we derive a
novel regret bound for a variational formulation of Thompson Sampling that
matches the strong guarantees of its standard counterpart. Our analysis reveals
the critical role of careful adaptation to the posterior probability of
maximality--a principle that underpins our ToSFiT algorithm. Empirically, we
validate our method on three diverse tasks: FAQ response refinement, thermally
stable protein search, and quantum circuit design. We demonstrate that online
fine-tuning significantly improves sample efficiency, with negligible impact on
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的相似性度量方法——邻近核，用于直接计算不完整数据在核特征空间中的相似性，避免了传统方法的信息丢失和偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法处理不完整数据时要么丢弃数据，要么进行插补预处理，导致信息丢失和相似性估计偏差。

Method: 通过数据依赖的分箱和邻近分配将数据投影到高维稀疏表示中，并提出级联回退策略处理缺失值。

Result: 在12个真实世界不完整数据集上的聚类任务中表现优于现有方法，且保持线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 邻近核是一种高效且有效的相似性度量方法，适用于不完整数据的分析。

Abstract: Measuring similarity between incomplete data is a fundamental challenge in
web mining, recommendation systems, and user behavior analysis. Traditional
approaches either discard incomplete data or perform imputation as a
preprocessing step, leading to information loss and biased similarity
estimates. This paper presents the proximity kernel, a new similarity measure
that directly computes similarity between incomplete data in kernel feature
space without explicit imputation in the original space. The proposed method
introduces data-dependent binning combined with proximity assignment to project
data into a high-dimensional sparse representation that adapts to local density
variations. For missing value handling, we propose a cascading fallback
strategy to estimate missing feature distributions. We conduct clustering tasks
on the proposed kernel representation across 12 real world incomplete datasets,
demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods while
maintaining linear time complexity. All the code are available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Generalist的框架，通过将泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务由专门的基学习器处理，最终结合这些学习器的参数以形成全局学习器，从而缓解对抗训练中的自然精度下降和鲁棒性迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练（AT）在实际应用中存在自然精度显著下降和鲁棒性难以跨攻击迁移的问题，论文旨在同时解决这两个问题。

Method: 将泛化目标分解为多个子任务，每个子任务由专门的基学习器处理，通过参数插值和周期性参数重分配形成全局学习器。

Result: Generalist框架在理论分析和实验中表现出更低的泛化误差，并显著缓解了对抗训练中的权衡问题。

Conclusion: Generalist为未来开发完全鲁棒的分类器提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of neural networks, they remain highly vulnerable
to adversarial examples, for which adversarial training (AT) is currently the
most effective defense. While AT has been extensively studied, its practical
applications expose two major limitations: natural accuracy tends to degrade
significantly compared with standard training, and robustness does not transfer
well across attacks crafted under different norm constraints. Unlike prior
works that attempt to address only one issue within a single network, we
propose to partition the overall generalization goal into multiple sub-tasks,
each assigned to a dedicated base learner. By specializing in its designated
objective, each base learner quickly becomes an expert in its field. In the
later stages of training, we interpolate their parameters to form a
knowledgeable global learner, while periodically redistributing the global
parameters back to the base learners to prevent their optimization trajectories
from drifting too far from the shared target. We term this framework Generalist
and introduce three variants tailored to different application scenarios. Both
theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that Generalist
achieves lower generalization error and significantly alleviates the trade-off
problems compared with baseline methods. Our results suggest that Generalist
provides a promising step toward developing fully robust classifiers in the
future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决云服务环境中复杂依赖关系和多样异常模式的挑战。

Method: 将服务交互抽象为依赖图，通过嵌入函数提取时空特征，利用图卷积机制聚合邻域信息，并引入对比学习框架增强异常模式的可分性。

Result: 在公开数据集上显著优于现有方法，关键指标（如Precision、Recall、F1-Score和AUC）表现优异，且在稀疏标注、监控噪声和流量波动下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 验证了依赖建模与对比学习结合的有效性，为云服务异常检测提供了完整技术方案，展示了在复杂环境中的强适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of complex dependencies and diverse
anomaly patterns in cloud service environments by proposing a dependency
modeling and anomaly detection method that integrates contrastive learning. The
method abstracts service interactions into a dependency graph, extracts
temporal and structural features through embedding functions, and employs a
graph convolution mechanism to aggregate neighborhood information for
context-aware service representations. A contrastive learning framework is then
introduced, constructing positive and negative sample pairs to enhance the
separability of normal and abnormal patterns in the representation space.
Furthermore, a temporal consistency constraint is designed to maintain
representation stability across time steps and reduce the impact of short-term
fluctuations and noise. The overall optimization combines contrastive loss and
temporal consistency loss to ensure stable and reliable detection across
multi-dimensional features. Experiments on public datasets systematically
evaluate the method from hyperparameter, environmental, and data sensitivity
perspectives. Results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms
existing methods on key metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC,
while maintaining robustness under conditions of sparse labeling, monitoring
noise, and traffic fluctuations. This study verifies the effectiveness of
integrating dependency modeling with contrastive learning, provides a complete
technical solution for cloud service anomaly detection, and demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability in complex environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据可用性和预测需求增加，但协作受限于数据所有权和竞争利益。

Method: 引入并分析了一个预测市场，结合历史表现、适应时变条件，并允许自由进出。使用稳健回归模型处理缺失提交，并引入考虑样本内外表现的分配机制。

Result: 通过模拟和真实数据案例验证了市场设计的有效性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该市场设计在协作预测中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Although both data availability and the demand for accurate forecasts are
increasing, collaboration between stakeholders is often constrained by data
ownership and competitive interests. In contrast to recent proposals within
cooperative game-theoretical frameworks, we place ourselves in a more general
framework, based on prediction markets. There, independent agents trade
forecasts of uncertain future events in exchange for rewards. We introduce and
analyse a prediction market that (i) accounts for the historical performance of
the agents, (ii) adapts to time-varying conditions, while (iii) permitting
agents to enter and exit the market at will. The proposed design employs robust
regression models to learn the optimal forecasts' combination whilst handling
missing submissions. Moreover, we introduce a pay-off allocation mechanism that
considers both in-sample and out-of-sample performance while satisfying several
desirable economic properties. Case-studies using simulated and real-world data
allow demonstrating the effectiveness and adaptability of the proposed market
design.

*Benjamin Kempinski,Tal Kachman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络（GNN）的新方法，用于近似计算网络流博弈中的Banzhaf值，显著提高了计算效率并展示了零样本泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如精确计算和蒙特卡洛采样）在处理大规模或动态系统时效率低下且无法跨网络配置迁移知识，亟需一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 将问题建模为图级预测任务，利用GNN（包括GAT、GINE和EdgeConv）从网络拓扑和控制结构中学习代理影响力的通用模式。

Result: GNN模型在合成数据集上实现了高保真近似，计算速度比传统方法快几个数量级，并展示了零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: GNN为复杂网络系统的可扩展合作博弈分析提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Computing the Banzhaf value in network flow games is fundamental for
quantifying agent influence in multi-agent systems, with applications ranging
from cybersecurity to infrastructure planning. However, exact computation is
intractable for systems with more than $\sim20$ agents due to exponential
complexity $\mathcal{O}(2^m)$. While Monte Carlo sampling methods provide
statistical estimates, they suffer from high sample complexity and cannot
transfer knowledge across different network configurations, making them
impractical for large-scale or dynamic systems. We present a novel
learning-based approach using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to approximate
Banzhaf values in cardinal network flow games. By framing the problem as a
graph-level prediction task, our method learns generalisable patterns of agent
influence directly from network topology and control structure. We conduct a
comprehensive empirical study comparing three state-of-the-art GNN
architectures-Graph Attention Networks (GAT), Graph Isomorphism Networks with
Edge features (GINE), and EdgeConv-on a large-scale synthetic dataset of
200,000 graphs per configuration, varying in size (20-100 nodes), agent count
(5-20), and edge probability (0.5-1.0). Our results demonstrate that trained
GNN models achieve high-fidelity Banzhaf value approximation with
order-of-magnitude speedups compared to exact and sampling-based methods. Most
significantly, we show strong zero-shot generalisation: models trained on
graphs of a specific size and topology accurately predict Banzhaf values for
entirely new networks with different structural properties, without requiring
retraining. This work establishes GNNs as a practical tool for scalable
cooperative game-theoretic analysis of complex networked systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种假设宽松的框架，用于评估生存分析中条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计在面临截断偏差时的稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床研究中常见的脱落现象（如因副作用退出）可能导致截断偏差，从而影响治疗效果估计的准确性。

Method: 使用部分识别方法推导CATE的信息边界，并开发了一种新的元学习器，利用任意机器学习模型估计边界。

Result: 框架能够识别在存在截断偏差时仍有效的患者亚组，并通过数值实验和癌症药物试验验证了其实际价值。

Conclusion: 该框架为评估截断偏差下治疗效果估计的稳健性提供了实用工具，促进了医学和流行病学中生存数据的可靠使用。

Abstract: Dropout is common in clinical studies, with up to half of patients leaving
early due to side effects or other reasons. When dropout is informative (i.e.,
dependent on survival time), it introduces censoring bias, because of which
treatment effect estimates are also biased. In this paper, we propose an
assumption-lean framework to assess the robustness of conditional average
treatment effect (CATE) estimates in survival analysis when facing censoring
bias. Unlike existing works that rely on strong assumptions, such as
non-informative censoring, to obtain point estimation, we use partial
identification to derive informative bounds on the CATE. Thereby, our framework
helps to identify patient subgroups where treatment is effective despite
informative censoring. We further develop a novel meta-learner that estimates
the bounds using arbitrary machine learning models and with favorable
theoretical properties, including double robustness and quasi-oracle
efficiency. We demonstrate the practical value of our meta-learner through
numerical experiments and in an application to a cancer drug trial. Together,
our framework offers a practical tool for assessing the robustness of estimated
treatment effects in the presence of censoring and thus promotes the reliable
use of survival data for evidence generation in medicine and epidemiology.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统RGB和热红外融合在恶劣条件下信息不足的问题，利用SWIR的优势，但缺乏公开数据集。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，合成SWIR增强的融合框架提升了图像质量（对比度、边缘清晰度等），并保持实时性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在监控和自动驾驶领域具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Enhancing scene understanding in adverse visibility conditions remains a
critical challenge for surveillance and autonomous navigation systems.
Conventional imaging modalities, such as RGB and thermal infrared (MWIR /
LWIR), when fused, often struggle to deliver comprehensive scene information,
particularly under conditions of atmospheric interference or inadequate
illumination. To address these limitations, Short-Wave Infrared (SWIR) imaging
has emerged as a promising modality due to its ability to penetrate atmospheric
disturbances and differentiate materials with improved clarity. However, the
advancement and widespread implementation of SWIR-based systems face
significant hurdles, primarily due to the scarcity of publicly accessible SWIR
datasets. In response to this challenge, our research introduces an approach to
synthetically generate SWIR-like structural/contrast cues (without claiming
spectral reproduction) images from existing LWIR data using advanced contrast
enhancement techniques. We then propose a multimodal fusion framework
integrating synthetic SWIR, LWIR, and RGB modalities, employing an optimized
encoder-decoder neural network architecture with modality-specific encoders and
a softmax-gated fusion head. Comprehensive experiments on public {RGB-LWIR
benchmarks (M3FD, TNO, CAMEL, MSRS, RoadScene) and an additional private real
RGB-MWIR-SWIR dataset} demonstrate that our synthetic-SWIR-enhanced fusion
framework improves fused-image quality (contrast, edge definition, structural
fidelity) while maintaining real-time performance. We also add fair trimodal
baselines (LP, LatLRR, GFF) and cascaded trimodal variants of
U2Fusion/SwinFusion under a unified protocol. The outcomes highlight
substantial potential for real-world applications in surveillance and
autonomous systems.

TL;DR: AdaLog是一种轻量级自适应系统，旨在提高移动应用中用户行为日志的存储效率，同时不影响模型推理准确性或延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习驱动的服务普及，记录用户行为数据带来了巨大的存储成本，导致系统响应性下降和更多应用卸载。

Method: AdaLog通过解决特征级冗余数据和稀疏存储问题，采用超图中的最大加权匹配问题和虚拟哈希属性设计，并设计了增量更新机制。

Result: 实验表明，AdaLog将行为日志大小减少了19%至44%，系统开销极小（仅2秒延迟和15MB内存使用）。

Conclusion: AdaLog为更广泛采用设备端机器学习提供了更高效的数据基础。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly integrated into modern mobile
apps to enable personalized and intelligent services. These models typically
rely on rich input features derived from historical user behaviors to capture
user intents. However, as ML-driven services become more prevalent, recording
necessary user behavior data imposes substantial storage cost on mobile apps,
leading to lower system responsiveness and more app uninstalls. To address this
storage bottleneck, we present AdaLog, a lightweight and adaptive system
designed to improve the storage efficiency of user behavior log in ML-embedded
mobile apps, without compromising model inference accuracy or latency. We
identify two key inefficiencies in current industrial practices of user
behavior log: (i) redundant logging of overlapping behavior data across
different features and models, and (ii) sparse storage caused by storing
behaviors with heterogeneous attribute descriptions in a single log file. To
solve these issues, AdaLog first formulates the elimination of feature-level
redundant data as a maximum weighted matching problem in hypergraphs, and
proposes a hierarchical algorithm for efficient on-device deployment. Then,
AdaLog employs a virtually hashed attribute design to distribute heterogeneous
behaviors into a few log files with physically dense storage. Finally, to
ensure scalability to dynamic user behavior patterns, AdaLog designs an
incremental update mechanism to minimize the I/O operations needed for adapting
outdated behavior log. We implement a prototype of AdaLog and deploy it into
popular mobile apps in collaboration with our industry partner. Evaluations on
real-world user data show that AdaLog reduces behavior log size by 19% to 44%
with minimal system overhead (only 2 seconds latency and 15 MB memory usage),
providing a more efficient data foundation for broader adoption of on-device
ML.

Result: 提出的Procrustes后处理方法在模型重训练、文本检索和多模态搜索中表现优异，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 正交变换能有效对齐嵌入表示，Procrustes后处理方法简单实用，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: Embedding models trained separately on similar data often produce
representations that encode stable information but are not directly
interchangeable. This lack of interoperability raises challenges in several
practical applications, such as model retraining, partial model upgrades, and
multimodal search. Driven by these challenges, we study when two sets of
embeddings can be aligned by an orthogonal transformation. We show that if
pairwise dot products are approximately preserved, then there exists an
isometry that closely aligns the two sets, and we provide a tight bound on the
alignment error. This insight yields a simple alignment recipe, Procrustes
post-processing, that makes two embedding models interoperable while preserving
the geometry of each embedding space. Empirically, we demonstrate its
effectiveness in three applications: maintaining compatibility across
retrainings, combining different models for text retrieval, and improving
mixed-modality search, where it achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 肿瘤学实验数据通常稀疏且仅包含少量时间点的肿瘤体积数据，因此需要一种能够利用先验动力学系统信息的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在MSE、MAE和MAPE等指标上表现出强收敛性，证明了其在稀疏数据下的有效性。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are neural networks that embed the
laws of dynamical systems modeled by differential equations into their loss
function as constraints. In this work, we present a PINN framework applied to
oncology. Here, we seek to learn time-varying interactions due to a combination
therapy in a tumor microenvironment. In oncology, experimental data are often
sparse and composed of a few time points of tumor volume. By embedding
inductive biases derived from prior information about a dynamical system, we
extend the physics-informed neural networks (PINN) and incorporate observed
biological constraints as regularization agents. The modified PINN algorithm is
able to steer itself to a reasonable solution and can generalize well with only
a few training examples. We demonstrate the merit of our approach by learning
the dynamics of treatment applied intermittently in an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model of a combination therapy. The algorithm yields a solution
to the ODE and time-varying forms of some of the ODE model parameters. We
demonstrate a strong convergence using metrics such as the mean squared error
(MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).

Abstract: Regression analysis is employed to examine and quantify the relationships
between input variables and a dependent and continuous output variable. It is
widely used for predictive modelling in fields such as finance, healthcare, and
engineering. However, traditional methods often struggle with real-world data
complexities, including uncertainty and ambiguity. While deep learning
approaches excel at capturing complex non-linear relationships, they lack
interpretability and risk over-fitting on small datasets. Fuzzy systems provide
an alternative framework for handling uncertainty and imprecision, with Mamdani
and Takagi-Sugeno-Kang (TSK) systems offering complementary strengths:
interpretability versus accuracy. This paper presents a novel fuzzy regression
method that combines the interpretability of Mamdani systems with the precision
of TSK models. The proposed approach introduces a hybrid rule structure with
fuzzy and crisp components and dual dominance types, enhancing both accuracy
and explainability. Evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance in several cases, with rules maintaining a
component similar to traditional Mamdani systems while improving precision
through improved rule outputs. This hybrid methodology offers a balanced and
versatile tool for predictive modelling, addressing the trade-off between
interpretability and accuracy inherent in fuzzy systems. In the 6 datasets
tested, the proposed approach gave the best fuzzy methodology score in 4
datasets, out-performed the opaque models in 2 datasets and produced the best
overall score in 1 dataset with the improvements in RMSE ranging from 0.4% to
19%.

Motivation: 高层建筑和低成本GPS设备导致停车位GPS点与实际位置存在偏差，需要一种无监督方法来纠正这些误差。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效解决GPS点误差问题，适用于各种类型的误差。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，解决了停车位GPS点校正的实际问题，数据集和代码已公开。

Abstract: Parking spots are essential components, providing vital mobile resources for
residents in a city. Accurate Global Positioning System (GPS) points of parking
spots are the core data for subsequent applications,e.g., parking management,
parking policy, and urban development. However, high-rise buildings tend to
cause GPS points to drift from the actual locations of parking spots; besides,
the standard lower-cost GPS equipment itself has a certain location error.
Therefore, it is a non-trivial task to correct a few wrong GPS points from a
large number of parking spots in an unsupervised approach. In this paper,
motivated by the physical constraints of parking spots (i.e., parking spots are
parallel to the sides of roads), we propose an unsupervised low-rank method to
effectively rectify errors in GPS points and further align them to the parking
spots in a unified framework. The proposed unconventional rectification and
alignment method is simple and yet effective for any type of GPS point errors.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to
solve a practical problem. The data set and the code are publicly accessible

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证多项式的非负性是一个NP难问题，传统方法计算成本高，需要解决维度随基增长而二次增加的半定规划（SDP）。

Method: 通过训练Transformer模型预测几乎最小的单项式基，结合高效数据集生成和回退机制，减少SDP规模。

Result: 在200多个基准数据集上验证，速度提升超过100倍，并能解决传统方法无法处理的实例。

Conclusion: 该方法为SOS编程的实际可扩展性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Certifying nonnegativity of polynomials is a well-known NP-hard problem with
direct applications spanning non-convex optimization, control, robotics, and
beyond. A sufficient condition for nonnegativity is the Sum of Squares (SOS)
property, i.e., it can be written as a sum of squares of other polynomials. In
practice, however, certifying the SOS criterion remains computationally
expensive and often involves solving a Semidefinite Program (SDP), whose
dimensionality grows quadratically in the size of the monomial basis of the SOS
expression; hence, various methods to reduce the size of the monomial basis
have been proposed. In this work, we introduce the first learning-augmented
algorithm to certify the SOS criterion. To this end, we train a Transformer
model that predicts an almost-minimal monomial basis for a given polynomial,
thereby drastically reducing the size of the corresponding SDP. Our overall
methodology comprises three key components: efficient training dataset
generation of over 100 million SOS polynomials, design and training of the
corresponding Transformer architecture, and a systematic fallback mechanism to
ensure correct termination, which we analyze theoretically. We validate our
approach on over 200 benchmark datasets, achieving speedups of over $100\times$
compared to state-of-the-art solvers and enabling the solution of instances
where competing approaches fail. Our findings provide novel insights towards
transforming the practical scalability of SOS programming.

Result: 实验验证了L2正则化ERM可直接提供良好校准的模型，无需后处理。

Conclusion: L2正则化ERM本身具备校准能力，为模型校准提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Calibration of predicted probabilities is critical for reliable machine
learning, yet it is poorly understood how standard training procedures yield
well-calibrated models. This work provides the first theoretical proof that
canonical $L_{2}$-regularized empirical risk minimization directly controls the
smooth calibration error (smCE) without post-hoc correction or specialized
calibration-promoting regularizer. We establish finite-sample generalization
bounds for smCE based on optimization error, regularization strength, and the
Rademacher complexity. We then instantiate this theory for models in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, deriving concrete guarantees for kernel
ridge and logistic regression. Our experiments confirm these specific
guarantees, demonstrating that $L_{2}$-regularized ERM can provide a
well-calibrated model without boosting or post-hoc recalibration. The source

optimalities, all the way up to Blackwell optimality. In this paper, we
investigate the problem of identifying policies of such optimality orders. To
that end, for each order, we construct a learning algorithm with vanishing
probability of error. Furthermore, we characterize the class of MDPs for which
identification algorithms can stop in finite time. That class corresponds to
the MDPs with a unique Bellman optimal policy, and does not depend on the
optimality order considered. Lastly, we provide a tractable stopping rule that
when coupled to our learning algorithm triggers in finite time whenever it is
possible to do so.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of natural
language processing, enhancing capabilities in both language understanding and
generation across diverse domains. However, developing LLMs for Arabic presents
unique challenges. This paper explores these challenges by focusing on critical
aspects such as data curation, tokenizer design, and evaluation. We detail our
approach to the collection and filtration of Arabic pre-training datasets,
assess the impact of various tokenizer designs on model performance, and
examine the limitations of existing Arabic evaluation frameworks, for which we
propose a systematic corrective methodology. To promote transparency and
facilitate collaborative development, we share our data and methodologies,
contributing to the advancement of language modeling, particularly for the
Arabic language.

Motivation: 现有癫痫检测方法多依赖单模态EEG信号，忽略了多模态信息的潜在优势。

Method: 提出DistilCLIP-EEG模型，整合EEG信号和文本描述，采用Conformer架构和BERT-LP进行跨模态表示学习，并通过知识蒸馏优化模型。

Result: 在多个数据集上准确率超97%，F1分数高于0.94，学生模型参数减少41.9%。

Conclusion: 模型在癫痫检测中表现优异，为资源受限环境部署轻量模型奠定基础。

Abstract: Epilepsy is a prevalent neurological disorder marked by sudden, brief
episodes of excessive neuronal activity caused by abnormal electrical
discharges, which may lead to some mental disorders. Most existing deep
learning methods for epilepsy detection rely solely on unimodal EEG signals,
neglecting the potential benefits of multimodal information. To address this,
we propose a novel multimodal model, DistilCLIP-EEG, based on the CLIP
framework, which integrates both EEG signals and text descriptions to capture
comprehensive features of epileptic seizures. The model involves an EEG encoder
based on the Conformer architecture as a text encoder, the proposed Learnable
BERT (BERT-LP) as prompt learning within the encoders. Both operate in a shared
latent space for effective cross-modal representation learning. To enhance
efficiency and adaptability, we introduce a knowledge distillation method where
the trained DistilCLIP-EEG serves as a teacher to guide a more compact student
model to reduce training complexity and time. On the TUSZ, AUBMC, and CHB-MIT
datasets, both the teacher and student models achieved accuracy rates exceeding
97%. Across all datasets, the F1-scores were consistently above 0.94,
demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the proposed framework.
Moreover, the student model's parameter count and model size are approximately
58.1% of those of the teacher model, significantly reducing model complexity
and storage requirements while maintaining high performance. These results
highlight the potential of our proposed model for EEG-based epilepsy detection
and establish a solid foundation for deploying lightweight models in
resource-constrained settings.

Motivation: 探索在隐私保护条件下（LDP）如何优化KL正则化的RLHF，填补了在线设置的理论空白。

Method: 离线设置中采用悲观算法，在线设置中采用乐观算法，并推导了理论边界。

Result: 离线设置中获得了$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$的次优性差距，在线设置中获得了$O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T)/(e^\epsilon-1)^2)$的遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 论文首次在LDP条件下分析了KL正则化的RLHF，并验证了理论结果的实用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the offline and online settings of reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) with KL-regularization -- a widely used
objective function in large language model alignment -- under the $\epsilon$
local differential privacy ($\epsilon$-LDP) model on the label of the human
preference. In the offline setting, we design an algorithm based on the
principle of pessimism and derive a new suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{O}(1/[(e^\epsilon-1)^2 n])$ on the KL-regularized objective under
single-policy concentrability. We also prove its optimality by providing a
matching lower bound where $n$ is the sample size.
  In the online setting, we are the first one to theoretically investigate the
problem of KL-regularized RLHF with LDP. We design an optimism-based algorithm
and derive a logarithmic regret bound of $O(d_{\mathcal{F}}\log
(N_{\mathcal{F}}\cdot T) /(e^\epsilon-1)^2 )$, where $T$ is the total time
step, $N_{\mathcal{F}}$ is cardinality of the reward function space
$\mathcal{F}$ and $d_{\mathcal{F}}$ is a variant of eluder dimension for RLHF.
As a by-product of our analysis, our results also imply the first analysis for
online KL-regularized RLHF without privacy. We implement our algorithm in the
offline setting to verify our theoretical results and release our open source
code at: https://github.com/rushil-thareja/PPKL-RLHF-Official.

Result: 在真实任务中表现优于其他策略，符合设备端资源限制。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了设备端LoRA持续合并的挑战，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: On-device deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently leverages
Low-Rank Adapters (LoRAs) to support diverse downstream tasks under tight
resource constraints. To address the limited storage capacity of mobile
devices, recent works have explored model merging techniques to fuse multiple
LoRAs into a single one. In practice, however, LoRAs are often delivered
incrementally, as users request support for new tasks (e.g., novel problem
types or languages). This scenario introduces a new challenge: on-device online
continual merging, where the objective is to incorporate new LoRAs while
preserving the performance on previously supported tasks. In this paper, we
propose a data-free and computationally efficient strategy for selecting and
merging LoRAs when a new one becomes available, assuming the device can store
only a limited number of adapters. Extensive experiments across real-world
tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to alternative
strategies while adhering to the storage budget and compute limitations of
on-device settings.

Motivation: 现有主题模型在医学文本上表现不佳，尤其是数据稀缺时。

Conclusion: ProtoTopic在低数据情况下能生成医学相关主题，效果显著。

Abstract: Topic modeling is a useful tool for analyzing large corpora of written
documents, particularly academic papers. Despite a wide variety of proposed
topic modeling techniques, these techniques do not perform well when applied to
medical texts. This can be due to the low number of documents available for
some topics in the healthcare domain. In this paper, we propose ProtoTopic, a
prototypical network-based topic model used for topic generation for a set of
medical paper abstracts. Prototypical networks are efficient, explainable
models that make predictions by computing distances between input datapoints
and a set of prototype representations, making them particularly effective in
low-data or few-shot learning scenarios. With ProtoTopic, we demonstrate
improved topic coherence and diversity compared to two topic modeling baselines
used in the literature, demonstrating the ability of our model to generate
medically relevant topics even with limited data.

Motivation: 传统OCO仅处理单一损失函数序列，而实际应用中可能需要同时优化多个目标。论文旨在解决多目标OCO问题，通过最小-最大遗憾衡量算法性能。

Method: 提出了一种结合Hedge和OGD的简单算法，适用于i.i.d.输入设置。

Result: 算法在i.i.d.模型下的期望最小-最大遗憾为O(√(T log K))。

Conclusion: 论文成功扩展了OCO到多目标场景，并通过简单算法和证明展示了其有效性。

Abstract: In online convex optimization (OCO), a single loss function sequence is
revealed over a time horizon of $T$, and an online algorithm has to choose its
action at time $t$, before the loss function at time $t$ is revealed. The goal
of the online algorithm is to incur minimal penalty (called $\textit{regret}$
compared to a static optimal action made by an optimal offline algorithm
knowing all functions of the sequence in advance.
  In this paper, we broaden the horizon of OCO, and consider multi-objective
OCO, where there are $K$ distinct loss function sequences, and an algorithm has
to choose its action at time $t$, before the $K$ loss functions at time $t$ are
revealed. To capture the tradeoff between tracking the $K$ different sequences,
we consider the $\textit{min-max}$ regret, where the benchmark (optimal offline
algorithm) takes a static action across all time slots that minimizes the
maximum of the total loss (summed across time slots) incurred by each of the
$K$ sequences. An online algorithm is allowed to change its action across time
slots, and its {\it min-max} regret is defined as the difference between its
$\textit{min-max}$ cost and that of the benchmark. The $\textit{min-max}$
regret is a stringent performance measure and an algorithm with small regret
needs to `track' all loss function sequences closely at all times.
  We consider this $\textit{min-max}$ regret in the i.i.d. input setting where
all loss functions are i.i.d. generated from an unknown distribution. For the
i.i.d. model we propose a simple algorithm that combines the well-known
$\textit{Hedge}$ and online gradient descent (OGD) and show via a remarkably
simple proof that its expected $\textit{min-max}$ regret is $O(\sqrt{T \log
K})$.

Method: 提出DOLFIN方法，结合Vision Transformers和低秩适配器（LoRA），并引入DualGPM防止遗忘。

Result: 在CIFAR-100等数据集上，DOLFIN在最终平均准确率上超越6个基线方法，同时保持相同的内存占用。

Conclusion: 正交低秩适配器为联邦环境中的隐私保护持续学习提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated continual learning (FCL) enables models to learn new tasks across
multiple distributed clients, protecting privacy and without forgetting
previously acquired knowledge. However, current methods face challenges
balancing performance, privacy preservation, and communication efficiency. We
introduce a Distributed Online LoRA for Federated INcremental learning method
DOLFIN, a novel approach combining Vision Transformers with low-rank adapters
designed to efficiently and stably learn new tasks in federated environments.
Our method leverages LoRA for minimal communication overhead and incorporates
DualGradient Projection Memory (DualGPM) to prevent forgetting. Evaluated on
CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, ImageNet-A, and CUB-200 under two Dirichlet
heterogeneity settings, DOLFIN consistently surpasses six strong baselines in
final average accuracy while matching their memory footprint. Orthogonal
low-rank adapters offer an effective and scalable solution for
privacy-preserving continual learning in federated settings.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨是否可以通过选择性对抗攻击来有选择性地降低或提升模型性能，而不显著影响其他模型。

Method: 使用TextAttack框架中的经典攻击方法，开发了一种选择性评估协议和自定义约束，并提出了一个代理-LLM管道来生成选择性扰动。

Result: 实证发现选择性对抗攻击确实存在，并能显著改变相对排名，影响评估的公平性和透明度。

Conclusion: 研究呼吁在LLM评估中引入扰动感知报告和鲁棒性诊断，并证明即使是细微的编辑也可能改变比较判断。

Abstract: Benchmarking outcomes increasingly govern trust, selection, and deployment of
LLMs, yet these evaluations remain vulnerable to semantically equivalent
adversarial perturbations. Prior work on adversarial robustness in NLP has
emphasized text attacks that affect many models equally, leaving open the
question of whether it is possible to selectively degrade or enhance
performance while minimally affecting other models. We formalize this problem
and study selective adversarial attacks on MMLU - a widely used benchmark
designed to measure a language model's broad general knowledge and reasoning
ability across different subjects. Using canonical attacks integrated into
TextAttack framework, we introduce a protocol for selectivity assessment,
develop a custom constraint to increase selectivity of attacks and propose a
surrogate-LLM pipeline that generates selective perturbations. Empirically, we
find that selective adversarial attacks exist and can materially alter relative
rankings, challenging the fairness, reproducibility, and transparency of
leaderboard-driven evaluation. Our results motivate perturbation-aware
reporting and robustness diagnostics for LLM evaluation and demonstrate that
even subtle edits can shift comparative judgments.

Motivation: 在先进节点中，优化功率、性能和面积（PPA）变得复杂且具有挑战性，现有方法因缺乏多样化训练数据和长设计流程时间而受限。

Method: ArtNet通过复制关键拓扑特征生成人工网表，增强ML模型的泛化能力，并支持更广泛的设计空间探索。

Result: 在CNN-based DRV预测中，ArtNet的数据增强使F1分数提高了0.16；在DTCO中，生成的mini-brains与目标设计的PPA匹配度达97.94%。

Conclusion: ArtNet通过生成更接近目标参数的多样化数据集，显著提升了PPA优化效率和设计探索能力。

Abstract: In advanced nodes, optimization of power, performance and area (PPA) has
become highly complex and challenging. Machine learning (ML) and
design-technology co-optimization (DTCO) provide promising mitigations, but
face limitations due to a lack of diverse training data as well as long design
flow turnaround times (TAT). We propose ArtNet, a novel artificial netlist
generator designed to tackle these issues. Unlike previous methods, ArtNet
replicates key topological characteristics, enhancing ML model generalization
and supporting broader design space exploration for DTCO. By producing
realistic artificial datasets that moreclosely match given target parameters,
ArtNet enables more efficient PPAoptimization and exploration of flows and
design enablements. In the context of CNN-based DRV prediction, ArtNet's data
augmentationimproves F1 score by 0.16 compared to using only the original
(real) dataset. In the DTCO context, ArtNet-generated mini-brains achieve a PPA
match up to 97.94%, demonstrating close alignment with design metrics of
targeted full-scale block designs.

Motivation: 传统通道选择方法难以处理SEEG数据的高维性和异质性，EEGChaT旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在DuIN数据集上，EEGChaT将解码准确性提升高达17%，且其通道权重与人工选择通道高度一致。

Conclusion: EEGChaT是一种高效且可解释的高维SEEG分析解决方案，兼具性能提升和神经信号相关性分析能力。

Abstract: Analyzing stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) signals is critical for
brain-computer interface (BCI) applications and neuroscience research, yet
poses significant challenges due to the large number of input channels and
their heterogeneous relevance. Traditional channel selection methods struggle
to scale or provide meaningful interpretability for SEEG data. In this work, we
propose EEGChaT, a novel Transformer-based channel selection module designed to
automatically identify the most task-relevant channels in SEEG recordings.
EEGChaT introduces Channel Aggregation Tokens (CATs) to aggregate information
across channels, and leverages an improved Attention Rollout technique to
compute interpretable, quantitative channel importance scores. We evaluate
EEGChaT on the DuIN dataset, demonstrating that integrating EEGChaT with
existing classification models consistently improves decoding accuracy,
achieving up to 17\% absolute gains. Furthermore, the channel weights produced
by EEGChaT show substantial overlap with manually selected channels, supporting
the interpretability of the approach. Our results suggest that EEGChaT is an
effective and generalizable solution for channel selection in high-dimensional
SEEG analysis, offering both enhanced performance and insights into neural
signal relevance.

Result: 在3D心脏电动力学建模任务中，P-M-GP显著优于现有方法，预测精度更高。

Conclusion: P-M-GP框架通过结合几何先验和物理约束，为复杂时空动态系统建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in sensing and imaging technologies have enabled the
collection of high-dimensional spatiotemporal data across complex geometric
domains. However, effective modeling of such data remains challenging due to
irregular spatial structures, rapid temporal dynamics, and the need to jointly
predict multiple interrelated physical variables. This paper presents a
physics-augmented multi-task Gaussian Process (P-M-GP) framework tailored for
spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we develop a geometry-aware,
multi-task Gaussian Process (M-GP) model to effectively capture intrinsic
spatiotemporal structure and inter-task dependencies. To further enhance the
model fidelity and robustness, we incorporate governing physical laws through a
physics-based regularization scheme, thereby constraining predictions to be
consistent with governing dynamical principles. We validate the proposed P-M-GP
framework on a 3D cardiac electrodynamics modeling task. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy over
existing methods by effectively incorporating domain-specific physical
constraints and geometric prior.

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保证隐私和安全的同时，解决了现有方法因多轮通信导致的模型不可用问题。

Abstract: Nowdays, there are an abundance of portable devices capable of collecting
large amounts of data and with decent computational power. This opened the
possibility to train AI models in a distributed manner, preserving the
participating clients' privacy. However, because of privacy regulations and
safety requirements, elimination upon necessity of a client contribution to the
model has become mandatory. The cleansing process must satisfy specific
efficacy and time requirements. In recent years, research efforts have produced
several knowledge removal methods, but these require multiple communication
rounds between the data holders and the process coordinator. This can cause the
unavailability of an effective model up to the end of the removal process,
which can result in a disservice to the system users. In this paper, we
introduce an innovative solution based on Task Arithmetic and the Neural
Tangent Kernel, to rapidly remove a client's influence from a model.

more expressive than 1-WL. Further, we provide a complete logical
characterization of EB-1WL based on first-order logic, and matching
distinguishability results based on homomorphism counting. (2)~In an important
distinction from previous proposals for more expressive GNN architectures,
EB-1WL and EB-GNN require near-linear time and memory on practical graph
learning tasks. (3)~Empirically, we show that EB-GNN is a highly-efficient

Motivation: 经典非线性降维方法缺乏将低维嵌入映射回高维空间的能力，限制了其在生成任务中的应用。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了一种系统框架，为经典NLDR方法构建神经解码器，实现双向映射，并扩展了基于扩散的生成过程。

Result: 实验表明，解码器能成功重建数据，但质量不及端到端优化的自编码器；基于流形的扩散生成样本质量较差。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了为可视化设计的NLDR方法在生成任务中的固有挑战，表明其离散和稀疏特性不适合生成模型的连续插值需求。

Abstract: Classical nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) techniques like t-SNE,
Isomap, and LLE excel at creating low-dimensional embeddings for data
visualization but fundamentally lack the ability to map these embeddings back
to the original high-dimensional space. This one-way transformation limits
their use in generative applications. This paper addresses this critical gap by
introducing a system- atic framework for constructing neural decoder
architectures for prominent NLDR methods, enabling bidirectional mapping for
the first time. We extend this framework by implementing a diffusion-based
generative process that operates directly within these learned manifold spaces.
Through experiments on the CelebA dataset, we evaluate the reconstruction and
generative performance of our approach against autoencoder and standard
diffusion model baselines. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade- off: while
the decoders successfully reconstruct data, their quality is surpassed by
end-to-end optimized autoencoders. Moreover, manifold-constrained diffusion
yields poor-quality samples, suggesting that the discrete and sparse nature of
classical NLDR embeddings is ill-suited for the continuous inter- polation
required by generative models. This work highlights the inherent challenges in
retrofitting generative capabilities onto NLDR methods designed primarily for
visualization and analysis.

Motivation: 现有量子储层计算研究多针对单变量信号，且忽略了近期的硬件限制，因此需要一种适用于多变量时间序列且适应硬件约束的方法。

Method: 通过配对注入和记忆量子比特，并使用Trotter化的最近邻横向场Ising演化，优化了当前设备的连接和深度。

Result: 在Lorenz-63和ENSO数据集上，MSE分别为0.0087和0.0036，性能与经典储层计算相当，甚至优于某些RNN。在IBM Heron R2上，MTS-QRC在真实深度下保持准确性，且噪声可能作为隐式正则化器。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于门的量子储层计算在NISQ硬件上的实用性，并激励了对硬件噪声如何有益于量子储层计算的系统研究。

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) offers a hardware-friendly approach to
temporal learning, yet most studies target univariate signals and overlook
near-term hardware constraints. This work introduces a gate-based QRC for
multivariate time series (MTS-QRC) that pairs injection and memory qubits and
uses a Trotterized nearest-neighbor transverse-field Ising evolution optimized
for current device connectivity and depth. On Lorenz-63 and ENSO, the method
achieves a mean square error (MSE) of 0.0087 and 0.0036, respectively,
performing on par with classical reservoir computing on Lorenz and above
learned RNNs on both, while NVAR and clustered ESN remain stronger on some
settings. On IBM Heron R2, MTS-QRC sustains accuracy with realistic depths and,
interestingly, outperforms a noiseless simulator on ENSO; singular value
analysis indicates that device noise can concentrate variance in feature
directions, acting as an implicit regularizer for linear readout in this
regime. These findings support the practicality of gate-based QRC for MTS
forecasting on NISQ hardware and motivate systematic studies on when and how
hardware noise benefits QRC readouts.

Result: 研究发现现有评估方法存在广泛的数据分区混淆问题，可能导致性能估计不准确。

Conclusion: 呼吁研究社区设计新的评估方法，如基于真正未来样本的评估，以确保TSFM评估的完整性。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) represent a new paradigm for time
series forecasting, offering zero-shot forecasting capabilities without the
need for domain-specific pre-training or fine-tuning. However, as with Large
Language Models (LLMs), evaluating TSFMs is tricky, as with ever more extensive
training sets, it becomes more and more challenging to ensure the integrity of
benchmarking data. Our investigation of existing TSFM evaluation highlights
multiple challenges, ranging from the representativeness of the benchmark
datasets, over the lack of spatiotemporal evaluation, to risks of information
leakage due to overlapping and obscure datasets, and the memorization of global
patterns caused by external shocks like economic crises or pandemics. Our
findings reveal widespread confusion regarding data partitions, risking
inflated performance estimates and incorrect transfer of global knowledge to
local time series. We argue for the development of robust evaluation
methodologies to prevent pitfalls already observed in LLM and classical time
series benchmarking, and call upon the research community to design new,
principled approaches, such as evaluations on truly out-of-sample future data,
to safeguard the integrity of TSFM assessment.

*Priyobrata Mondal,Faizanuddin Ansari,Swagatam Das*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于分布校准的方法RCS，通过利用多数类和中间类的高斯混合参数来估计少数类的分布参数，有效解决了类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡问题导致分类器偏向多数类，现有方法仅依赖多数类分布近似少数类统计，容易产生过度泛化问题。

Method: 使用编码器-解码器网络保持不平衡数据的结构，通过分布校准策略生成合成样本，利用邻域数据点分布校准参数。

Result: 实验表明，RCS在图像、文本和表格数据集上优于多种基线方法和先进技术。

Conclusion: RCS通过分布校准和邻域信息利用，显著提升了不平衡分类的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The class imbalance problem refers to the insufficiency of data in certain
classes, which causes a classifier to be biased toward the majority class.
Distribution calibration is a technique that seeks to estimate a more accurate
class distribution based on an observed or estimated one. To address this
issue, we propose a distribution calibration-based method-Rebalancing with
Calibrated Sub-classes (RCS): An Enhanced Approach for Robust Imbalanced
Classification, which estimates the distribution parameters of the minority
classes using weighted parameters derived from a mixture of Gaussian components
from both the majority and intermediate classes. An encoder-decoder network is
trained to preserve the structure of the imbalanced data and prevent
disentanglement. After training, feature vectors extracted from the encoder are
used to generate synthetic samples through our distribution calibration
strategy. This approach effectively mitigates the overgeneralization problem
that arises when only the distribution of the majority class is used to
approximate the minority class statistics. Instead, our method calibrates the
parameters by leveraging the distribution of data points in neighboring
regions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves
superior classification performance compared to several baseline and
state-of-the-art techniques across a diverse range of image, text, and tabular
datasets.

Result: XNN在多种训练场景下表现优异，尤其在未见维度上具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多维预训练对基础模型的重要性，XNN为解决维度问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The advent of foundation models in AI has significantly advanced
general-purpose learning, enabling remarkable capabilities in zero-shot
inference and in-context learning. However, training such models on physics
data, including solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), poses a
unique challenge due to varying dimensionalities across different systems.
Traditional approaches either fix a maximum dimension or employ separate
encoders for different dimensionalities, resulting in inefficiencies. To
address this, we propose a dimension-agnostic neural network architecture, the
Axial Neural Network (XNN), inspired by parameter-sharing structures such as
Deep Sets and Graph Neural Networks. XNN generalizes across varying tensor
dimensions while maintaining computational efficiency. We convert existing PDE
foundation models into axial neural networks and evaluate their performance
across three training scenarios: training from scratch, pretraining on multiple
PDEs, and fine-tuning on a single PDE. Our experiments show that XNNs perform
competitively with original models and exhibit superior generalization to
unseen dimensions, highlighting the importance of multidimensional pretraining
for foundation models.

Motivation: 探讨对角预条件方法在深度学习中的性能差异，尤其是Adam和Gauss-Newton方法在不同场景下的表现。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，比较Adam和GN方法在二次目标和逻辑回归中的表现。

Result: Adam在全批量设置下可能优于GN方法，而在随机设置下与GN$^{-1/2}$表现相似。

Conclusion: Adam和GN方法各有优劣，选择取决于具体场景和数据特性。

Abstract: Diagonal preconditioners are computationally feasible approximate to
second-order optimizers, which have shown significant promise in accelerating
training of deep learning models. Two predominant approaches are based on Adam
and Gauss-Newton (GN) methods: the former leverages statistics of current
gradients and is the de-factor optimizers for neural networks, and the latter
uses the diagonal elements of the Gauss-Newton matrix and underpins some of the
recent diagonal optimizers such as Sophia.
  In this work, we compare these two diagonal preconditioning methods through
the lens of two key factors: the choice of basis in the preconditioner, and the
impact of gradient noise from mini-batching. To gain insights, we analyze these
optimizers on quadratic objectives and logistic regression under all four
quadrants. We show that regardless of the basis, there exist instances where
Adam outperforms both GN$^{-1}$ and GN$^{-1/2}$ in full-batch settings.
Conversely, in the stochastic regime, Adam behaves similarly to GN$^{-1/2}$ for
linear regression under a Gaussian data assumption. These theoretical results
are supported by empirical studies on both convex and non-convex objectives.

Conclusion: InfoRM、IBL和MOP共同推进了RLHF技术的发展。

Abstract: Despite the success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in
aligning language models with human values, reward hacking-or reward
over-optimization-remains a major challenge. We identify two key obstacles to
its mitigation: (1) reward misgeneralization in reward modeling, where reward
models overfit to spurious, preference-irrelevant features; and (2) the lack of
suitable regularization during RL optimization, as existing token-level
constraints often over-restrict the policy space. To address these issues, we
propose InfoRM, an information-theoretic reward modeling framework based on the
Information Bottleneck (IB) principle, which filters out preference-irrelevant
information to alleviate reward misgeneralization. We further observe that
reward-hacked responses manifest as pronounced outliers in InfoRM's IB latent
space, measured by Mahalanobis distance from the SFT-induced distribution.
Motivated by this, we introduce IBL, a distribution-level regularization that
penalizes such deviations, effectively expanding the optimization landscape
while maintaining alignment. We prove that IBL is theoretically equivalent to
the pessimistic RL objective within the IB latent space. Finally, we present
Mahalanobis Outlier Probability (MOP), a statistical metric for quantifying
reward hacking severity, enabling principled hyperparameter tuning and online
mitigation such as early stopping. Extensive experiments across diverse LLMs
and datasets confirm the generality of our findings, the effectiveness of
InfoRM and IBL, and the reliability of MOP as a diagnostic tool-collectively
advancing the state of RLHF.

Conclusion: 该方法为组合问题提供了近似解，理论上有收敛保证。

Abstract: Pruning is a common technique to reduce the compute and storage requirements
of Neural Networks. While conventional approaches typically retrain the model
to recover pruning-induced performance degradation, state-of-the-art Large
Language Model (LLM) pruning methods operate layer-wise, minimizing the
per-layer pruning error on a small calibration dataset to avoid full
retraining, which is considered computationally prohibitive for LLMs. However,
finding the optimal pruning mask is a hard combinatorial problem and solving it
to optimality is intractable. Existing methods hence rely on greedy heuristics
that ignore the weight interactions in the pruning objective. In this work, we
instead consider the convex relaxation of these combinatorial constraints and
solve the resulting problem using the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm. Our method
drastically reduces the per-layer pruning error, outperforms strong baselines
on state-of-the-art GPT architectures, and remains memory-efficient. We provide
theoretical justification by showing that, combined with the convergence
guarantees of the FW algorithm, we obtain an approximate solution to the
original combinatorial problem upon rounding the relaxed solution to
integrality.

Abstract: Kilometer-scale weather data is crucial for real-world applications but
remains computationally intensive to produce using traditional weather
simulations. An emerging solution is to use deep learning models, which offer a
faster alternative for climate downscaling. However, their reliability is still
in question, as they are often evaluated using standard machine learning
metrics rather than insights from atmospheric and weather physics. This paper
benchmarks recent state-of-the-art deep learning models and introduces
physics-inspired diagnostics to evaluate their performance and reliability,
with a particular focus on geographic generalization and physical consistency.
Our experiments show that, despite the seemingly strong performance of models
such as CorrDiff, when trained on a limited set of European geographies (e.g.,
central Europe), they struggle to generalize to other regions such as Iberia,
Morocco in the south, or Scandinavia in the north. They also fail to accurately
capture second-order variables such as divergence and vorticity derived from
predicted velocity fields. These deficiencies appear even in in-distribution
geographies, indicating challenges in producing physically consistent
predictions. We propose a simple initial solution: introducing a power spectral
density loss function that empirically improves geographic generalization by
encouraging the reconstruction of small-scale physical structures. The code for
reproducing the experimental results can be found at

Abstract: The curse of dimensionality renders Reinforcement Learning (RL) impractical
in many real-world settings with exponentially large state and action spaces.
Yet, many environments exhibit exploitable structure that can accelerate
learning. To formalize this idea, we study RL in Block Markov Decision
Processes (BMDPs). BMDPs model problems with large observation spaces, but
where transition dynamics are fully determined by latent states. Recent
advances in clustering methods have enabled the efficient recovery of this
latent structure. However, a regret analysis that exploits these techniques to
determine their impact on learning performance remained open. We are now
addressing this gap by providing a regret analysis that explicitly leverages
clustering, demonstrating that accurate latent state estimation can indeed
effectively speed up learning.
  Concretely, this paper analyzes a two-phase RL algorithm for BMDPs that first
learns the latent structure through random exploration and then switches to an
optimism-guided strategy adapted to the uncovered structure. This algorithm
achieves a regret that is $O(\sqrt{T}+n)$ on a large class of BMDPs susceptible
to clustering. Here, $T$ denotes the number of time steps, $n$ is the
cardinality of the observation space, and the Landau notation $O(\cdot)$ holds
up to constants and polylogarithmic factors. This improves the best prior
bound, $O(\sqrt{T}+n^2)$, especially when $n$ is large. Moreover, we prove that
no algorithm can achieve lower regret uniformly on this same class of BMDPs.
This establishes that, on this class, the algorithm achieves asymptotic
optimality.

Result: 在数值基准和实际案例中验证了模型的有效性，能够可靠整合多模态数据并提供准确预测。

Conclusion: 该模型能自适应输入数据，保持性能稳定性，适用于跨时间和参数变化的场景。

Abstract: Highly accurate datasets from numerical or physical experiments are often
expensive and time-consuming to acquire, posing a significant challenge for
applications that require precise evaluations, potentially across multiple
scenarios and in real-time. Even building sufficiently accurate surrogate
models can be extremely challenging with limited high-fidelity data.
Conversely, less expensive, low-fidelity data can be computed more easily and
encompass a broader range of scenarios. By leveraging multi-fidelity
information, prediction capabilities of surrogates can be improved. However, in
practical situations, data may be different in types, come from sources of
different modalities, and not be concurrently available, further complicating
the modeling process. To address these challenges, we introduce a progressive
multi-fidelity surrogate model. This model can sequentially incorporate diverse
data types using tailored encoders. Multi-fidelity regression from the encoded
inputs to the target quantities of interest is then performed using neural
networks. Input information progressively flows from lower to higher fidelity
levels through two sets of connections: concatenations among all the encoded
inputs, and additive connections among the final outputs. This dual connection
system enables the model to exploit correlations among different datasets while
ensuring that each level makes an additive correction to the previous level
without altering it. This approach prevents performance degradation as new
input data are integrated into the model and automatically adapts predictions
based on the available inputs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach
on numerical benchmarks and a real-world case study, showing that it reliably
integrates multi-modal data and provides accurate predictions, maintaining
performance when generalizing across time and parameter variations.

Conclusion: TGPS为高效、可扩展的PDE求解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Machine learning solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) have
attracted growing interest. However, most existing approaches, such as neural
network solvers, rely on stochastic training, which is inefficient and
typically requires a great many training epochs. Gaussian process
(GP)/kernel-based solvers, while mathematical principled, suffer from
scalability issues when handling large numbers of collocation points often
needed for challenging or higher-dimensional PDEs.
  To overcome these limitations, we propose TGPS, a tensor-GP-based solver that
models factor functions along each input dimension using one-dimensional GPs
and combines them via tensor decomposition to approximate the full solution.
This design reduces the task to learning a collection of one-dimensional GPs,
substantially lowering computational complexity, and enabling scalability to
massive collocation sets.
  For efficient nonlinear PDE solving, we use a partial freezing strategy and
Newton's method to linerize the nonlinear terms. We then develop an alternating
least squares (ALS) approach that admits closed-form updates, thereby
substantially enhancing the training efficiency. We establish theoretical
guarantees on the expressivity of our model, together with convergence proof
and error analysis under standard regularity assumptions. Experiments on
several benchmark PDEs demonstrate that our method achieves superior accuracy
and efficiency compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Forecasting urban phenomena such as housing prices and public health
indicators requires the effective integration of various geospatial data.
Current methods primarily utilize task-specific models, while recent foundation
models for spatial representations often support only limited modalities and
lack multimodal fusion capabilities. To overcome these challenges, we present
UrbanFusion, a Geo-Foundation Model (GeoFM) that features Stochastic Multimodal
Fusion (SMF). The framework employs modality-specific encoders to process
different types of inputs, including street view imagery, remote sensing data,
cartographic maps, and points of interest (POIs) data. These multimodal inputs
are integrated via a Transformer-based fusion module that learns unified
representations. An extensive evaluation across 41 tasks in 56 cities worldwide
demonstrates UrbanFusion's strong generalization and predictive performance
compared to state-of-the-art GeoAI models. Specifically, it 1) outperforms
prior foundation models on location-encoding, 2) allows multimodal input during
inference, and 3) generalizes well to regions unseen during training.
UrbanFusion can flexibly utilize any subset of available modalities for a given
location during both pretraining and inference, enabling broad applicability
across diverse data availability scenarios. All source code is available at

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become central to training large language
models (LLMs), yet the field lacks predictive scaling methodologies comparable
to those established for pre-training. Despite rapidly rising compute budgets,
there is no principled understanding of how to evaluate algorithmic
improvements for scaling RL compute. We present the first large-scale
systematic study, amounting to more than 400,000 GPU-hours, that defines a
principled framework for analyzing and predicting RL scaling in LLMs. We fit
sigmoidal compute-performance curves for RL training and ablate a wide range of
common design choices to analyze their effects on asymptotic performance and
compute efficiency. We observe: (1) Not all recipes yield similar asymptotic
performance, (2) Details such as loss aggregation, normalization, curriculum,
and off-policy algorithm primarily modulate compute efficiency without
materially shifting the asymptote, and (3) Stable, scalable recipes follow
predictable scaling trajectories, enabling extrapolation from smaller-scale
runs. Combining these insights, we propose a best-practice recipe, ScaleRL, and
demonstrate its effectiveness by successfully scaling and predicting validation
performance on a single RL run scaled up to 100,000 GPU-hours. Our work
provides both a scientific framework for analyzing scaling in RL and a
practical recipe that brings RL training closer to the predictability long
achieved in pre-training.

Abstract: Temporal graph classification plays a critical role in applications such as
cybersecurity, brain connectivity analysis, social dynamics, and traffic
monitoring. Despite its significance, this problem remains underexplored
compared to temporal link prediction or node forecasting. Existing methods
often rely on snapshot-based or recurrent architectures that either lose
fine-grained temporal information or struggle with long-range dependencies.
Moreover, local message-passing approaches suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing, limiting their ability to capture complex temporal structures.
  We introduce T3former, a novel Topological Temporal Transformer that
leverages sliding-window topological and spectral descriptors as first-class
tokens, integrated via a specialized Descriptor-Attention mechanism. This
design preserves temporal fidelity, enhances robustness, and enables principled
cross-modal fusion without rigid discretization. T3former achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, including dynamic
social networks, brain functional connectivity datasets, and traffic networks.
It also offers theoretical guarantees of stability under temporal and
structural perturbations. Our results highlight the power of combining
topological and spectral insights for advancing the frontier of temporal graph
learning.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for the Markov Decision Process (MDP) has emerged
in many security-related applications, such as autonomous driving, financial
decisions, and drone/robot algorithms. In order to improve the
robustness/defense of RL systems against adversaries, studying various
adversarial attacks on RL systems is very important. Most previous work
considered deterministic adversarial attack strategies in MDP, which the
recipient (victim) agent can defeat by reversing the deterministic attacks. In
this paper, we propose a provably ``invincible'' or ``uncounterable'' type of
adversarial attack on RL. The attackers apply a rate-distortion
information-theoretic approach to randomly change agents' observations of the
transition kernel (or other properties) so that the agent gains zero or very
limited information about the ground-truth kernel (or other properties) during
the training. We derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the recipient
agent's reward regret and show the impact of rate-distortion attacks on
state-of-the-art model-based and model-free algorithms. We also extend this
notion of an information-theoretic approach to other types of adversarial
attack, such as state observation attacks.
