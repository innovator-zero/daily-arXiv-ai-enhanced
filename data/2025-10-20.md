Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动化处理原始视频，生成高质量、多模态标注数据，显著提升标注效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动标注耗时且昂贵，阻碍了鲁棒世界模型的训练。

Method: GAZE通过标准化视频格式、AI模型预标注和结构化输出，实现高效标注。

Result: 节省19分钟/小时，减少80%人工审核，生成高密度、隐私保护的标注数据。

Conclusion: GAZE为世界模型训练提供了高效、可扩展的高质量数据生成方案。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PC-UNet的模型，通过PVMC-Loss结合物理数据，显著提升了PET图像的信噪比和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET成像中降低剂量会增加泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 采用Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet)模型和PVMC-Loss，结合物理数据优化图像质量。

Result: 在PET数据集上测试表明，PC-UNet提升了物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能有效整合物理信息，为低剂量PET成像提供了一种可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过干预注意力图来减少文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖优化或外部输入，无法有效解决语义泄漏问题。

Method: DeLeaker动态重加权注意力图，抑制跨实体交互并增强实体身份。

Result: DeLeaker在SLIM数据集上表现优于基线，且不影响生成质量。

Conclusion: 注意力控制是提升文本到图像模型语义精确性的有效途径。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到模拟系统，通过众包城市游览视频生成物理感知的交互式模拟场景，用于训练城市AI代理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工或程序生成的模拟场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，因此需要一种更高效的方法来生成多样化的高保真城市环境。

Method: UrbanVerse包括UrbanVerse-100K（10万+带注释的3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频中提取场景布局并生成3D模拟的自动管道）。

Result: UrbanVerse生成了160个高质量场景，实验显示其场景保留了真实世界的语义和布局，训练出的导航策略在仿真和零样本迁移中表现优异。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse为城市AI代理的训练提供了高效、可扩展且逼真的模拟环境，显著提升了导航性能。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的框架，用于精确且一致的3D对象编辑，解决了现有方法的低效和不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D对象编辑方法效率低、不一致，且难以保留未编辑区域，Nano3D旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Nano3D结合FlowEdit和TRELLIS进行局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge策略以保持结构一致性。

Result: 实验表明，Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量上优于现有方法，并构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。

Conclusion: Nano3D显著提升了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

### [6] [Constantly Improving Image Models Need Constantly Improving Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15021)

TL;DR: ECHO是一个从社交媒体收集真实用户提示和反馈的基准框架，用于评估图像生成模型的新能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准无法及时捕捉图像生成模型的新功能，导致评估与实际使用脱节。

Method: 通过社交媒体收集用户提示和反馈，构建包含31,000多个提示的数据集。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准未涵盖的复杂任务，能更好地区分模型性能，并提供改进模型质量的反馈。

Conclusion: ECHO填补了评估与实际使用之间的差距，为图像生成模型的进步提供了更准确的评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于子模优化的方法，用于从海量LoRA适配器中选择最相关且多样化的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户在海量LoRA适配器中难以选择和有效利用的问题。

Method: 将任务建模为组合优化问题，并提出子模框架。

Result: 实验证明该方法能在多领域生成多样化输出。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了LoRA适配器的选择和多样性问题。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一种高效的基础模型家族，用于通用实例分割，支持从高端设备到移动硬件的部署，显著降低计算成本同时保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在资源受限平台上的高计算成本限制了其应用，需要一种高效且不牺牲性能的解决方案。

Method: 提出MOBIUS，包括瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导的不确定性校准损失和统一的训练策略。

Result: MOBIUS减少了55%的像素解码FLOPs和75%的Transformer解码FLOPs，同时保持SOTA性能，仅需三分之一的训练迭代。

Conclusion: MOBIUS为高性能计算平台和移动设备上的高效分割设定了新基准。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS框架通过分解种子问题并重组，高效提升多模态大语言模型在图表等领域的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在缺乏标注数据的领域（如图表、网页）推理能力不足的问题。

Method: 提出COGS框架，分解种子问题为感知和推理因子，重组生成大量合成问答对，并引入过程奖励强化学习。

Result: COGS显著提升模型在未见问题上的表现，尤其在推理密集和组合问题上，且能泛化到其他领域。

Conclusion: COGS是一种高效、可泛化的方法，能显著增强模型在低标注数据领域的推理能力。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

TL;DR: GDGen框架通过势能视角统一刚体、关节体和软体动力学，提出几何无关系统，扩展经典弹性动力学以捕捉广泛物理行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发通用具身智能体在可扫描环境中需要统一复杂物理行为的动力学表示。

Method: 引入方向刚度扩展弹性动力学，使用神经网络建模材料属性，神经场表示变形。

Result: GDGen成功统一多种仿真范式，适用于交互式虚拟环境和机器人训练。

Conclusion: GDGen为复杂动态场景提供了通用且稳健的动力学生成基础。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为COLIPRI的视觉语言预训练方法，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉预训练，解决了3D医学影像领域数据不足的问题，并在多个任务中取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D医学影像领域的视觉语言编码器（VLEs）受限于数据不足，影响了其在分类、检索等任务中的表现。

Method: 通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉预训练，利用图像和图像-文本对数据，开发了COLIPRI编码器家族。

Result: COLIPRI在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务中达到最优性能，并在语义分割任务中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: COLIPRI通过引入额外归纳偏置和数据增强，显著提升了3D医学影像领域的视觉语言预训练性能。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: DRIFT是一种轻量级方法，通过梯度空间传递推理知识，提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免资源密集型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如监督微调或强化学习）资源消耗大，而简单的模型合并效果不稳定。

Method: DRIFT通过预计算推理先验，并在微调过程中偏向梯度，实现高效的推理知识传递。

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等基准测试中，DRIFT优于简单合并和监督微调，且成本更低。

Conclusion: DRIFT是一种高效且低成本的方法，显著提升了多模态大语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

TL;DR: 婴儿通过日常视觉经验的统计特性学习基本物体类别，其视觉输入的“块状相似性结构”有助于小数据集下的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨婴儿如何从有限的视觉经验中学习并泛化基本物体类别。

Method: 分析14名7至11个月大婴儿的自我中心视觉图像，计算其视觉输入的相似性结构，并通过机器学习实验验证其效果。

Result: 婴儿的视觉输入具有“块状相似性结构”，模拟这种结构可提升机器学习模型在小数据集下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 婴儿日常视觉经验的自然结构支持早期类别学习，并为高效学习提供了普适原则。

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一种新型的3D高斯溅射重建框架，通过结构感知和长期重建解决了现有方法的冗余和几何不一致问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频序列时存在大量冗余和几何不一致性，需要一种更高效、鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 引入紧凑锚点基元，通过可微分显著性感知高斯量化和3D点Transformer来优化锚点属性和显著性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，包括新视角合成和深度估计，且效率高、鲁棒性强。

Conclusion: SaLon3R在无需已知相机参数或测试时优化的情况下，显著提升了长期通用3D重建的效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT框架通过结合轨迹和局部文本描述提升视频生成的控制能力，采用LACA和双CFG方案，实验显示其优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在复杂场景和多对象控制上表现不佳，缺乏精确的轨迹与视觉实体对应关系。

Method: 提出TGT框架，结合轨迹与局部文本描述，采用LACA和双CFG方案，并开发数据标注流程。

Result: TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐和运动控制上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TGT通过轨迹和文本结合，显著提升了视频生成的控制能力和质量。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: FFT-MIL通过频域分支增强MIL，提升WSI分类的全局依赖建模能力，平均提高F1分数3.51%和AUC 1.51%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法难以捕捉WSI的全局依赖，影响诊断预测的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出FFT-MIL框架，通过FFT提取低频特征，结合卷积层和Min-Max归一化处理，并与空间特征融合。

Result: 在三个数据集上测试，FFT-MIL平均提升F1分数3.51%和AUC 1.51%。

Conclusion: 频域学习是提升WSI分类全局依赖的有效方法，可增强MIL在计算病理学中的扩展性和准确性。

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估跨模态问答能力，但缺乏对模态不变推理能力的深入分析。

Method: 设计了包含60,828个多选题的XModBench，覆盖五种任务家族和六种模态组合，用于细粒度诊断。

Result: 实验显示，即使是Gemini 2.5 Pro也存在空间和时间推理困难、模态差异和方向不平衡问题。

Conclusion: 当前OLLMs远未实现真正的模态不变推理，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基础工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

Motivation: 现有MLLMs预训练中高质量图像-文本交错文档数据过滤研究不足，需高效方法提升数据质量。

Method: 采用半合成方法生成多质量级别样本-评分对，训练UniFilter分类器过滤高质量数据。

Result: UniFilter过滤的数据显著提升MLLMs的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，下游任务表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter有效提升多模态预训练数据质量，释放相关资源促进社区发展。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估超参数设置和数据增强策略对三个下游数据集的影响。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值为0.7-0.8表现最佳，分布式训练提高稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会降低性能。

Conclusion: LC25000（Colon）数据集是最可重复的基准，研究为开发可重复的数字病理学基础模型提供了实用规则。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了训练数据集的多样性，增强了下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Conclusion: DriveGen3D在保持参数效率的同时，显著提升了动态3D驾驶场景的生成质量和可控性。

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,
yielding higher accuracy and more robust outcomes than individual baseline
models. By combining established models with targeted post-processing, we
achieve improved and more accessible inpainting outcomes, supporting broader
clinical deployment and sustainable, resource-conscious research. Our 2025

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，且学习到的嵌入与实际共现模式高度相关。

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式。

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

Motivation: VAE+扩散模型范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢和迁移性差的问题，主要原因是VAE潜在空间缺乏语义分离和判别结构。

Result: SVG加速了扩散训练，支持少步采样，提高了生成质量，并保留了自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一种有原则的途径。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Result: 在七个基准测试中，CoMe剪枝30%参数的LLaMA-2-7b模型保留了83%的原始平均准确率。

Conclusion: CoMe在模型剪枝中实现了最先进的性能，有效平衡了模型大小与能力保留。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at

TL;DR: Proto-Former是一个统一的自适应端到端面部标志检测框架，通过增强数据集特定的面部结构表示（原型）来解决多数据集训练的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部标志检测数据集定义不同数量的标志，主流方法仅能在单一数据集上训练，限制了模型泛化能力和统一模型的发展。

Method: Proto-Former包含自适应原型感知编码器（APAE）和渐进原型感知解码器（PPAD），并引入原型感知（PA）损失函数。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，Proto-Former表现优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过统一架构和原型优化，显著提升了面部标志检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: ORCA利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，通过可学习的任务提示和视觉提示，为机器人控制提供任务自适应的视觉表示，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉表示在模仿学习中虽有效，但通常是任务无关的，且在策略学习过程中保持不变。本文探索如何利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，在不微调模型的情况下，为机器人控制提供任务自适应的视觉表示。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，引入可学习的任务提示和视觉提示，分别适应控制环境和捕捉细粒度、帧特定的细节。

Result: ORCA在多个机器人控制基准测试中达到最先进性能，显著超越先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过设计新的条件（任务提示和视觉提示），ORCA成功实现了任务自适应的视觉表示，显著提升了机器人控制的性能。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control
benchmarks, significantly surpassing prior methods.

TL;DR: SHARE是一种利用场景几何空间线索准确重建人类运动的技术，仅需单目RGB视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D空间中准确定位人类运动存在困难，影响游戏、AR/VR和机器人领域的应用。

Method: SHARE通过估计人体网格和分割掩码，结合场景点图迭代优化关键帧位置，并保持非关键帧一致性。

Result: 实验表明SHARE优于现有方法，能更准确地在3D场景中定位人类运动。

Conclusion: SHARE为3D人类运动重建提供了更准确的解决方案，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Cortical-SSM的新架构，用于分类EEG和ECoG信号，解决了现有Transformer方法在捕捉细粒度依赖关系上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG和ECoG信号在运动想象分类中有重要应用，但易受生理伪影干扰，且现有方法难以捕捉细粒度依赖关系。

Method: 扩展深度状态空间模型，捕捉EEG和ECoG信号在时间、空间和频率域的综合依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中（两个大规模EEG数据集和一个临床ECoG数据集）表现优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Cortical-SSM不仅能有效分类信号，还能捕捉神经生理学相关区域，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上达到96.4%的mAP，并在CATARACTS数据集上验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 逐步冻结微调是一种有前景的技术，适用于多种手术工具检测任务。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖深度预测恢复空间信息，但存在深度不连续和小物体区分度低的问题，且忽略了跨视角一致性和尺度不变性。

Method: 采用FSPE构建特征金字塔，CSDP预测像素级深度分布，PDE结合2D特征和3D位置嵌入生成深度感知特征。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上验证了方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FreqPDE通过频率感知和跨视角机制显著提升了3D物体检测性能。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕捉，导致重建不完整，PFGS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: PFGS通过全局和局部配准策略，将辅助姿态图像融合到主姿态的3DGS表示中，并利用背景特征和基础模型优化配准过程。

Result: 实验表明，PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于基线方法，生成更完整且高保真的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过智能融合多姿态图像，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅的完整性和质量。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

TL;DR: LILAC提出了一种基于VAE-Diffusion的实时流式架构，用于长序列任意风格化运动生成，解决了现有方法在计算开销和时间稳定性上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在实时生成高质量风格化运动时存在计算开销大和时间稳定性差的问题，而离线方法无法满足实时需求。

Method: LILAC通过滑动窗口因果设计和解码运动特征注入，将离线VAE-Diffusion框架扩展到在线设置，实现实时处理。

Result: 实验表明，LILAC在风格化质量和响应性之间取得了良好平衡，无需依赖未来帧或修改扩散模型架构。

Conclusion: LILAC成功实现了长序列实时任意风格化运动生成，为相关应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

Conclusion: 该研究为水下感知提供了新基准和解决方案，推动了开放词汇分割在水下场景的应用。

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

Motivation: 临床多b值扩散加权成像（multi-shot DWI）因呼吸、蠕动等运动引起的相位伪影和多器官复杂性而受限，需要一种鲁棒且高分辨率的解决方案。

Conclusion: LoSP-Prompt提供了一种无需导航信号和真实数据监督的鲁棒解决方案，具有在精准肿瘤学中应用的潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

Motivation: 现有检测方法泛化性差或效率低，需改进。

Method: 提出LoD框架，包括多模态安全概念激活向量和无监督攻击分类模块。

Conclusion: LoD框架有效提升检测未知越狱攻击的能力和效率。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

Motivation: 解决如何构建街道级指标以捕捉事故相关特征，并量化其因果影响的挑战。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割提取11个街道景观指标，结合XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计因果效应。

Result: 发现场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何特征对预测影响显著；驾驶区域和应急空间大降低风险，视觉开放度过高增加风险。

Conclusion: Semantic4Safety为城市道路安全规划提供了可扩展的数据驱动工具，支持针对性干预和高风险路段诊断。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

Method: 提出预测-校正范式，包含预测先验模块（PPM）生成粗略近似，校正残差网络（CRN）专注于修正误差。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割中，PCMambaNet仅需1-5轮训练即达到最优精度。

Conclusion: 通过显式结合领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解数据低效和过拟合问题。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

### [45] [MAVR-Net: Robust Multi-View Learning for MAV Action Recognition with Cross-View Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15448)
*Nengbo Zhang,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAVR-Net是一个多视角学习框架，通过结合RGB帧、光流和分割掩码数据，显著提高了微型飞行器（MAV）动作识别的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV运动的复杂时空特征，限制了动作区分能力。

Method: 采用ResNet编码器提取多视角特征，结合多尺度特征金字塔和跨视角注意力模块，设计多视角对齐损失以增强特征表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异，准确率分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%。

Conclusion: MAVR-Net通过多视角融合和跨视角交互，显著提升了MAV动作识别的性能。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间空中跟踪器，通过编码目标属性特征生成精确提示，解决了现有方法因缺乏细粒度线索而导致的性能不佳问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有夜间空中跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，缺乏细粒度线索，导致提示模糊，跟踪性能不佳。

Method: DPTrack通过分层捕获目标拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示，并将这些特征编码到方向核中，生成精确提示。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DPTrack表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过引入细粒度属性线索和精确提示生成，显著提升了夜间空中跟踪的准确性。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

*Vu Tram Anh Khuong,Luu Tu Nguyen,Thanh Ha Le,Thi Duyen Ngo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态图像的双相位时间增强方法，用于提升微表情识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别因标注数据稀缺而受限，现有方法忽视时间增强策略。

Method: 将表情序列分解为两个运动相位（onset-to-apex和apex-to-offset），生成双相位动态图像以增强多样性。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上，结合空间增强后性能提升10%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关，适用于低资源场景，为微表情识别提供了新方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

TL;DR: MRASfM框架针对多摄像头驾驶场景优化SfM，提升姿态估计可靠性和路面重建质量，并通过场景聚合提高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多摄像头驾驶场景中SfM存在姿态估计不可靠、路面重建异常点多和效率低的问题。

Method: 利用多摄像头固定空间关系增强姿态估计，平面模型去除路面异常点，Bundle Adjustment优化效率，多场景聚合模块实现粗到细的聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上绝对姿态误差为0.124，验证了其先进性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM在多摄像头驾驶场景中显著提升了SfM的可靠性和效率，适用于复杂实际应用。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Result: 在自建数据集上，MSAM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSAM为无人机视频-文本检索提供了高效解决方案，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有微表情识别方法通常只关注起始到顶点阶段，忽略了顶点到终止阶段的关键动态信息。

Method: 引入综合光流（COF），整合两阶段动态信息以增强特征表示。

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上，COF优于单光流方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: COF通过全面分析运动动态，显著提升了微表情识别性能。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the
apex-to-offset phase, which holds key temporal dynamics. This study introduces
a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Motivation: 低光RAW图像增强在质量和效率上仍存在挑战，现有方法难以兼顾两者。

Method: 采用分层混合架构（HiMA），结合Transformer和Mamba模块处理不同尺度特征；引入LoDA模块调整局部特征分布；设计MPF模块融合空间和频域先验。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上表现优于现有方法，参数更少。

Conclusion: HiMA通过新颖架构和模块设计，实现了高效且高质量的低光图像增强。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型存在系统性偏见，传统方法依赖标注属性，成本高且受限。

Method: 提出Latent Feature Alignment (LFA)，利用潜在方向识别子群体。

Result: LFA在语义一致性和可解释性上优于k-means和最近邻搜索。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型的实用审计工具，无需预定义属性标注。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

Method: 通过三次架构迭代（基线、CBAM增强和平衡多任务注意力），结合Coordinate Attention和Squeeze-Excitation块，使用可学习融合参数统一空间和光谱特征提取。

Result: 最终12层架构在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%的准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。

Conclusion: 系统化架构设计在卫星图像分类中表现优异，无需预训练模型即可接近微调ResNet-50的性能。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中效果显著，但成本高且不易获取，需替代方案。

Method: 基于3D扩散桥的框架，学习MRI和患者信息到PET图像的映射。

Result: 诊断准确率从75%提升至84.7%，模拟PET图像评分更高。

Conclusion: SiM2P使FDG-PET诊断优势更易获取，适用于资源有限环境。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

*Harkaitz Goyena,Peter M. Atkinson,Unai Pérez-Goya,M. Dolores Ugarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种标准化方法（传统上采样和ABSIS锐化方法）来提升STIF方法的准确性，其中ABSIS方法在光谱和空间准确性上分别提高了49.46%和78.40%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了促进STIF方法的应用，需要解决不同传感器图像的分辨率匹配问题。

Method: 提出了两种标准化方法：1) 传统上采样方法；2) ABSIS锐化方法，后者结合了高分辨率图像的整体特征和低分辨率图像的独特属性。

Result: 两种方法均显著提高了USTFIP STIF方法的准确性，尤其是ABSIS方法在光谱和空间准确性上分别提升了49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: ABSIS方法在提升图像融合的准确性和质量方面表现优异，为STIF方法的应用提供了有效支持。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Result: 在构建的统一数据集CIRS-PEDES上，FlexiReID实现了最先进的性能，并在复杂场景中表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: FlexiReID为多模态行人重识别提供了灵活且高效的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex
scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法运行时间过长，难以在实际场景中部署，如生产线监控。

Method: 提出QFCA方法，量化特征对应分析（FCA）算法，并引入PCA预处理增强特征对比。

Result: 速度提升10倍，精度几乎无损，复杂纹理检测精度提高。

Conclusion: QFCA在速度和精度上优于现有方法，适用于实时应用。

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Motivation: 现有自监督去噪技术计算和内存需求高，难以平衡推理速度与重建质量。

Method: 基于Noise2Noise框架，提出多阶段去噪流程N2D，通过破坏噪声空间相关性生成平滑结构，再细化恢复细节。

Result: N2D在性能上超越现有无数据集技术，且计算资源需求极低。

Conclusion: N2D结合高效、低成本和数据无关性，成为生物医学成像等领域的实用工具。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督医学图像分割框架，仅需四个极值点标注，通过SAM2生成伪标签，结合FGEPM算法和USC损失，性能媲美全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全监督医学图像分割需要大量像素级标注，成本高且耗时，因此提出弱监督方法以减少标注负担。

Method: 利用极值点生成边界框作为SAM2的提示，生成伪标签；通过FGEPM算法和USC损失优化伪标签和边界对齐。

Result: 在两个超声数据集上表现媲美甚至超越全监督方法，显著降低标注成本。

Conclusion: 提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中高效且实用。

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型在神经肿瘤影像中具有高效、可扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

Motivation: 现有医学AI系统无法同时处理图像理解和生成任务，导致数据表示和特征整合的不足。

Method: 构建UniMed-5M数据集，采用渐进式课程学习，设计UniMedVL统一模型。

Result: 在五个医学图像理解基准上表现优异，生成质量与专业模型相当。

Conclusion: 统一架构实现双向知识共享，提升多模态任务性能。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

Result: 在现代视频和历史胶片上均显著提升了分类准确率和F1分数。

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验与Transformer表示互补，小规模校准的运动头可显著增强退化胶片分析的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in

Method: SEGA采用分层推理框架，先粗粒度估计布局，再通过细化模块优化结果，并结合布局设计原则作为先验知识。

Result: 实验表明，SEGA在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: SEGA通过逐步演化和先验知识，显著提升了内容感知布局生成的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以检测隐含的性暗示提示，且微调方法可能损害模型生成质量。

Method: 利用早期预测噪声的可分离性进行检测，并提出噪声增强的自适应负引导机制。

Result: 在自然和对抗数据集上验证了NDM优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NDM有效解决了隐含恶意意图问题，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上，边界召回率显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了粗标注下的语义分割性能，尤其在边界对齐方面。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

TL;DR: LDCBM通过解耦视觉特征提升概念瓶颈模型的可解释性和分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型存在输入到概念的映射偏差和有限的可控性，限制了其实际应用价值。

Method: 提出轻量级解耦概念瓶颈模型（LDCBM），通过滤波器分组损失和联合概念监督，自动将视觉特征分组为语义组件。

Result: 在三个数据集上，LDCBM在概念和分类准确性上均优于现有模型。

Conclusion: LDCBM通过视觉证据增强概念的可解释性，提升了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Result: 实验表明ReCon显著提升生成数据的质量和可训练性，在不同数据集和架构中表现一致。

Conclusion: ReCon为结构可控生成模型提供了高效的数据增强解决方案。

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

TL;DR: ERNet提出了一种高效的前馈模型，用于处理非刚性变形的点云序列注册问题，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列，显著提升了准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非刚性变形点云注册中的局部最小值和误差累积问题，尤其是在噪声或部分输入情况下。

Method: 采用数据驱动方法，设计了两阶段管道：先估计帧级粗粒度图节点，再以滑动窗口方式优化轨迹。

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上表现优于现有方法，速度提升4倍以上。

Conclusion: ERNet在准确性和效率上均有显著改进，适用于复杂变形场景。

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时优化方法难以应对视频的多面性，需要更高效的视频生成优化方案。

Method: VISTA通过分解用户想法为结构化时间计划，生成视频后通过锦标赛选出最佳，再由专业代理评估视觉、音频和上下文保真度，最后通过推理代理优化提示。

Result: VISTA在单场景和多场景视频生成中表现一致优于基线方法，60%胜率，人类评估偏好66.4%。

Conclusion: VISTA通过多代理迭代优化显著提升视频生成质量和用户意图对齐。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

*Jiayi Lin,Jiabo Huang,Shaogang Gong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为RelateSeg的神经符号空间推理方法，用于开放词汇语义分割（OVSS），通过一阶逻辑约束提升空间关系理解，并在多个数据集上取得最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型（VLM）的方法在理解场景中物体的空间关系方面存在不足，限制了开放词汇语义分割的性能。

Method: 提出RelateSeg方法，通过一阶逻辑公式编码空间关系（如“猫在人的右侧”），并结合伪类别和模糊逻辑松弛实现端到端学习。

Result: RelateSeg在四个基准数据集上达到最优平均mIoU，尤其在多类别图像中表现突出，且仅需一个辅助损失函数，无额外参数。

Conclusion: 神经符号空间推理在OVSS中有效，RelateSeg通过显式空间关系约束显著提升了分割性能。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

Motivation: 解决单张肖像图像生成新视角和重新照明的问题，传统方法受限于模型假设和参数化。

Method: 利用生成头部模型的潜在空间和新的反射网络，结合OLAT数据集训练，实现高保真重新照明。

Result: 3DPR在保留身份和捕捉光照效果（如高光、自阴影和次表面散射）方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DPR通过生成先验和高质量数据集，显著提升了单张图像重新照明的效果。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

Method: 利用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索，从少量先验案例中自动生成前景/背景点提示，指导SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上，Memory-SAM的mIoU达到0.9863，显著优于FCN和基线方法。

Conclusion: 检索生成提示的方法实现了数据高效、鲁棒的舌部不规则边界分割，适用于真实场景。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Conclusion: 数据质量和规模是关键，结合自回归和扩散模型的优势可提升性能。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Method: BiomedXPro利用大型语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro表现优于现有方法，尤其在数据稀缺的少样本场景中，且提示与临床特征语义对齐。

Conclusion: BiomedXPro通过生成可解释的提示对，为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，推动了更可信且临床对齐的AI系统的发展。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban

real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and

OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to

Motivation: 可持续能源发展增加了电力负荷的不确定性，挑战了本地电网基础设施的可靠性。TSO需要更高空间分辨率的负荷预测，从区域聚合扩展到单个节点。

Method: 设计了一个多级系统，包括可解释和可扩展的预测模型，解决了节点负荷的异质性和波动性问题，并采用完全并行化的单模型预测工作流程。

Conclusion: 该系统使运营商能够以前所未有的信心和准确性调整预测，并精确诊断原本不透明的错误。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

*Rijul Tandon,Peter Vamplew,Cameron Foale*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ES-C51改进C51算法，通过Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习，提升稳定性与性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统C51在动作期望奖励相似时分布不稳定，需改进。

Method: 使用Expected Sarsa更新，结合软最大化计算，替代贪婪Q学习。

Result: ES-C51在Gym和Atari-10中表现优于QL-C51。

Conclusion: ES-C51通过更稳定的分布学习，提升强化学习性能。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于集成深度学习的无监督异常检测框架，用于风力涡轮机的早期故障检测，显著提高了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风力涡轮机的可靠性对可再生能源行业至关重要，早期故障检测可以减少停机时间和维护成本。

Method: 结合了变分自编码器（VAE）、LSTM自编码器和Transformer架构，通过特征工程提取多维度指标，并通过集成评分和自适应阈值检测异常。

Result: 在CARE数据集上，AUC-ROC达到0.947，并能提前48小时检测到故障。

Conclusion: 该方法通过预测性维护减少了涡轮机故障，提高了大规模风能部署的运营效率。

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

TL;DR: AlignFlow利用半离散最优传输（SDOT）改进流式生成模型（FGM）的训练，通过噪声空间与数据点的显式对齐提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于最优传输的FGM方法受限于批量采样，难以扩展到大规模高维数据集。

Method: AlignFlow通过SDOT将噪声空间划分为Laguerre单元，每个单元映射到数据点，实现噪声与数据的显式对齐。

Result: 实验表明AlignFlow能显著提升多种FGM算法的性能，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: AlignFlow是一种可扩展、高效的FGM训练方法，可作为即插即用组件。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

Motivation: 信用评分在金融服务中至关重要，但量子机器学习（QML）的黑箱特性阻碍了其在需要透明度的领域的应用。

Method: 提出IQNN-CS框架，结合变分QNN和后解释技术，并引入Inter-Class Attribution Alignment（ICAA）度量标准。

Result: 在两个真实信用数据集上，IQNN-CS表现出稳定的训练动态、竞争性的预测性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: IQNN-CS为金融决策提供了透明且可解释的QML模型路径。

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

TL;DR: 论文提出SPA框架，通过自监督微调学习世界模型，提升LLM在OOD场景中的决策能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在分布外（OOD）场景中表现不佳，难以适应复杂动态环境，需要改进其决策能力。

Method: 分解世界模型为状态表示和转移建模，通过自监督微调（SFT）阶段冷启动策略，再用于模拟未来状态以优化策略。

Result: SPA显著提升性能，如在Sokoban中成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升至70.9%。

Conclusion: SPA框架通过世界模型和自监督微调，有效提升了LLM在复杂环境中的泛化能力和决策性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境固定，智能体只能被动适应。本文探索智能体通过主动修改环境动态来提升奖励的可能性。

Method: 引入MCTVMDP框架，包含上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略，联合优化以调整环境动态和行动策略。

Result: 智能体能够通过主动配置环境动态和优化行动策略，共同提升长期奖励。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP为智能体提供了主动改变环境动态的能力，扩展了传统强化学习的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

Motivation: LLM广泛使用导致输出中出现重复短语（slop），降低了文本质量且容易被识别为AI生成。

Method: 1. Antislop Sampler通过回溯抑制重复字符串；2. 自动化流程分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据；3. FTPO微调方法调整单个token的logits。

Result: Antislop成功抑制8000+重复模式，FTPO减少90% slop且保持性能，优于DPO。

Conclusion: Antislop框架有效提升LLM输出质量，减少重复短语，同时保持或提升跨领域性能。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前TPL系统维护依赖经验，缺乏科学监测，导致维护不及时或不必要，影响制造质量和效率。

Method: 结合物理信息的数据驱动预测模型与统计方法，处理不同复杂度的场景。

Result: 实验数据验证方法的高准确性、鲁棒性和泛化性。

Conclusion: 为TPL系统实现基于状态的维护迈出重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

Motivation: 研究ℓ_p-范数目标在在线设置中的权衡，尤其是公平性（ℓ_∞-范数）与总分歧（ℓ_1-范数）之间的冲突。

Method: 提出一种在线带样本（AOS）模型的算法，利用少量样本生成单一聚类，同时满足多个范数的竞争比。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中高概率实现O(log⁴n)竞争比（所有ℓ_p-范数）、O(logn)竞争比（ℓ_∞-范数）和O(1)竞争比（ℓ_1-范数）。

Conclusion: 成功将离线“全范数”保证扩展到在线世界，并通过下界证明竞争比的紧性。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

Conclusion: TempO在参数和内存效率上优于基于注意力或卷积的回归器，适用于高保真多尺度动力学预测。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

Result: DLER减少70%输出长度且准确性超越基线，测试时并行生成响应更高效。

Conclusion: DLER在准确性和效率间取得最佳平衡，适用于数据稀缺场景。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图信号，应用数据依赖的低通滤波，通过路径图拉普拉斯算子的特征向量投影实现平滑估计。

Result: 方法在合成和真实数据上表现良好，优于logspline和高斯KDE基线，但存在已知缺陷（如突变不连续）。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简单、计算高效，适合自动化管道和大规模探索性分析。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Conclusion: 研究表明，BiLSTM在恐怖主义事件预测中表现优异，长期历史数据和双向编码是关键，同时提供了代码和伦理声明。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

Motivation: 理解神经网络在训练过程中如何调整内部表示（特征学习）的机制，目前仍缺乏理论支持。

Method: 使用统计物理方法，推导了一个可处理的、自洽的平均场理论，分析了两层非线性网络在随机梯度Langevin动力学（SGLD）训练下的贝叶斯后验。

Result: 理论预测了对称性破缺相变，网络会突然与目标函数对齐；并发现自我强化的输入特征选择机制是改善泛化性能的关键。

Conclusion: 通过引入自我强化的输入特征选择机制，平均场理论能够定量匹配SGLD训练网络的学习曲线，为特征学习提供了机制性解释。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测地线问题在物理和工程中广泛存在，但科学机器学习领域对其研究较少。论文认为测地线问题的几何简单性、变分结构和自然非线性使其非常适合Deep Ritz方法。

Method: 采用Deep Ritz方法，通过三个数值实验（路径规划、光学和固体力学）验证其有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明Deep Ritz方法在解决测地线问题上具有潜力。

Conclusion: 论文提出Deep Ritz方法是解决测地线问题的有前景的方向，为未来科学机器学习研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种两阶段模型，结合临床和影像信息，提高髋部骨折风险预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具（如DXA T-score和FRAX）敏感性不足，易漏诊高风险人群，尤其是无骨折史或骨量减少者。

Method: 采用两阶段模型：第一阶段（筛查）使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量；第二阶段（影像）结合DXA特征优化预测。

Result: 模型在内部和外部验证中表现一致，敏感性高于T-score和FRAX，漏诊率更低。

Conclusion: 该模型为髋部骨折早期风险评估提供了成本效益高且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

Motivation: 传统的高保真有限元模拟计算成本高且耗时，因此研究机器学习替代方法以提高效率和降低成本。

Method: 研究了两种神经网络架构（MeshGraphNet和Transolver）和三种瞬态动力学建模策略（时间条件、标准自回归和稳定性增强的自回归）。

Conclusion: 机器学习在结构碰撞动力学中的应用具有可行性，虽未完全匹配有限元精度，但显著提升了设计探索和优化的效率。

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Motivation: 理解表示几何和归一化对Mahalanobis距离方法性能的影响，以提升OOD检测的可靠性。

Method: 通过实证研究分析不同图像基础模型、数据集和归一化方案，提出径向缩放的$\ell_2$归一化方法。

Result: Mahalanobis方法并非普遍可靠；光谱和本征维度指标可预测OOD性能；径向缩放归一化显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 研究为设计更可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解，通过控制特征空间几何改进OOD检测。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

TL;DR: 论文提出ReasonIF基准，评估大型推理模型（LRMs）在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现当前模型表现不佳，并提出两种改进策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大型推理模型在推理过程中遵循指令的能力，以提高其可控性、透明性并减少风险。

Method: 引入ReasonIF基准，评估多种开源LRMs，并探索多轮推理和指令微调（RIF）两种改进方法。

Result: 当前模型在推理指令遵循上表现较差（IFS低于0.25），RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升至0.27。

Conclusion: 推理指令遵循是LRMs的重要能力，现有方法虽有改进但仍需进一步提升。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

Motivation: 探究不同预训练模型在RLVR后表现差异的微观原因，以理解模型推理能力的本质。

Method: 通过Horn子句形式化推理，使用稀疏自编码器提取特征，并基于语义正确性分类规则，提出SAL指标量化模型对知识正确性的区分能力。

Result: 发现高潜力模型能系统区分知识正确性，SAL指标与RLVR后推理表现高度相关（R²=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型推理潜力与其预训练时区分知识正确性的能力紧密相关，SAL可作为选择或设计更强基础模型的实用指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

Result: 在ExORL和D4RL Kitchen数据集上表现优异，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BREEZE通过创新设计解决了零样本RL的关键问题，展现了鲁棒性和高性能。

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best
or near-the-best performance while exhibiting superior robustness compared to
prior offline zero-shot RL methods. The official implementation is available

that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based

The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient

Motivation: 研究在分布漂移环境下的序列决策问题，旨在通过熵正则化和信任衰减提高鲁棒性和适应性。

Method: 使用熵正则化的信任衰减方法，结合信念更新和镜像下降决策，通过Fenchel对偶性证明信念倾斜和决策倾斜的一致性。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界和动态遗憾保证，在KL漂移路径长度下达到$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$的遗憾。

Conclusion: 该方法统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，适用于多种扩展场景。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

TL;DR: DWRL框架通过双权重强化学习整合CoT推理与BT模型，提升非可验证任务的偏好建模性能。

Motivation: 扩展强化学习至非可验证任务（如人类偏好对）的挑战与不足。

Method: 提出DWRL框架，结合实例权重和组权重优化BT模型的最大似然目标。

Result: DWRL在多基准和模型规模下优于基线，生成连贯可解释的推理。

Conclusion: DWRL为超越可验证任务的推理增强偏好学习提供通用框架。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Conclusion: Transformer架构有望支持禽类疾病早期预警系统，促进及时干预。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero 通过鲁棒贝叶斯优化提升零样本提示的可靠性，在分布偏移下显著提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示搜索方法在分布偏移和对抗评估下性能下降，需要一种更可靠的提示优化方法。

Method: 使用 f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒获取规则最大化最坏情况期望效用。

Result: 在多个任务中（如形式化重写、代码调试、翻译）性能提升显著，例如 BIG-Bench 任务准确率提升 25-30%。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero 将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习结合，提供了一种可靠且可迁移的提示对齐方法。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了现代尺度不变架构中学习率宽度依赖的问题，实现了零样本超参数迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构在训练过程中会进入优化器主导的稳态，导致归一化层对反向尺度敏感，学习率依赖宽度，从而影响μP（最大更新参数化）的迁移效果。

Method: 通过观察矩阵参数奇异值谱的缩放规律，提出了一种权重衰减缩放规则（λ₂∝√d），并结合向量参数的学习率规则（η₁=Θ_d(1)和λ₁=0），实现了学习率和权重衰减的零样本迁移。

Result: 在LLaMA风格的Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了规则的有效性，并提供了一种简单的诊断方法（匹配顶部奇异值）来检查子层增益不变性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式控制优化器设定的稳态尺度，将μP扩展到近初始状态之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

<details>

Motivation: 解决地球观测中模型依赖相关性特征而缺乏泛化能力的问题。

Method: 结合因果发现与序列建模，使用多模态卫星数据和J-PCMCI+方法识别区域特异性因果预测因子。

Result: 在分布外评估中，因果模型比基线方法准确率提高12.59%。

Conclusion: 因果建模不仅用于特征选择，还能构建泛化性强且机制明确的动态地表过程模型。

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Result: 在多个基准SSR数据集上验证了方法的鲁棒性和性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了SSR中伪标签的可靠性问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Motivation: 传统集合数据同化方法在精度和计算效率之间存在权衡，需要一种新方法在较小集合规模下保持高精度。

Method: 使用小规模集合生成初步分析状态，再通过FCNN学习修正项以提升精度。

Result: 新方法在相同集合规模下比传统EnKF精度更高，且计算成本几乎不变。

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法在多种应用中具有潜力，且计算效率高。

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA适用于动态现实世界去中心化网络，具有实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Conclusion: 加权RFLAF在显著减少特征数量的同时保持性能，验证了理论和方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Conclusion: 通过MoE架构和逻辑多样性损失，实现了对多种图对抗攻击的统一防御。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实时流数据预测中的非平稳动态、计算限制和快速适应问题，避免现有方法在准确性、适应性和效率之间的权衡。

Method: 结合随机傅里叶特征与在线动态模式分解，利用Sherman-Morrison更新在滚动窗口中持续适应动态变化，仅需当前数据。

Result: 在多个领域的基准数据集上，WORK-DMD比现有在线预测方法更准确，尤其擅长短期预测，且仅需单次数据遍历。

Conclusion: WORK-DMD通过核评估与自适应矩阵更新的结合，以最小数据需求实现强预测性能，为流预测提供了一种实用的深度学习替代方案。

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

TL;DR: ParaFormer是一种浅层Transformer架构，通过并行结构和计算设计，解决了深度模型训练时间长、推理延迟高的问题，并在性能和效率上优于传统Transformer。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型（如ResNet和Transformer）虽然性能高，但存在训练时间长、推理延迟高、资源消耗大的问题，ParaFormer旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过将标准Transformer建模为闭式函数逼近器，理论分析表明性能依赖于层间协作而非深度。ParaFormer通过并行分支组织层，算法化实现层间协作，实现渐进逼近。

Result: ParaFormer在实验中表现优于ViT等标准Transformer，支持高达15.07倍的模型压缩，并在多GPU部署中比FairScale快3.30倍。

Conclusion: ParaFormer通过闭式公式化Transformer，不仅解释了“深度信念”，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Method: 将最大似然训练转化为鞍点问题，通过耦合Wasserstein梯度流和随机参数上升进行优化。

Result: 证明了在标准假设下的收敛性，并在物理系统数值模拟中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了更紧的ELBO，且在生成建模任务中具有竞争力。

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型低基数假设更弱，且最大似然估计在此情况下可能失败。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文强盗中的离线模仿学习，提出一种样本复杂度与奖励类基数对数相关的新方法。

Result: 新方法在样本复杂度上优于最大似然估计，适用于低基数奖励模型场景。

Conclusion: 研究鼓励在从正确演示中学习时超越最大似然估计，探索更高效的方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Motivation: 解决在分配偏差下的反事实预测问题，避免对抗训练的不稳定性和调参负担。

Result: 在数值模拟和真实临床数据上表现优于现有方法，尤其在似然、反事实误差和政策评估指标上。

Conclusion: 该方法在避免对抗训练问题的同时，实现了高效且稳定的反事实预测。

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Result: 在MuJoCo实验中，OffSim显著优于现有离线IRL方法，证明了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: OffSim提供了一种高效、自动化的替代方案，减少了强化学习中对模拟器和手动奖励设计的依赖。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

Result: 在合成任务和实际任务中，SESA显著提升了路径多样性和性能，成功率相对基线RL提升高达211%。

Conclusion: SESA为RL训练的LLMs提供了一种结构化的探索方法，有效提升了推理的多样性和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Method: 提出KME-CLIP，利用核希尔伯特空间内积捕捉PMI的线性结构。

Result: 理论证明可逼近PMI，实验显示在检索和分类任务中优于标准CLIP。

Conclusion: KME-CLIP通过优化相似性计算机制，提升了多模态对比预训练框架的性能。

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本特性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署有重要意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Conclusion: 数据集大小是蒸馏机制中被忽视的关键变量。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

representations for multivariate datasets containing tens to hundreds of

all data variables simultaneously through parameter sharing. This allows us to
achieve state-of-the-art data compression. Through comprehensive evaluations,
we demonstrate superior performance in terms of reconstructed data quality,

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下训练，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并与像素误差进行相关性分析。

Result: 全局相关性弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05），不同增强方法间差异显著但无实际意义。

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在边界误差定位中作用有限，需开发替代或混合方法。

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

*Edward Tansley,Estelle Massart,Coralia Cartis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了深度神经网络中特征学习的数学基础，扩展了神经特征假设（NFA）到多层网络，并验证了其深度依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解特征学习是建立深度神经网络数学基础的重要问题，NFA假设了权重矩阵与梯度外积的关系。

Method: 通过梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化，理论分析了NFA在多层网络中的适用性，并进行了数值实验验证。

Result: 证明了NFA在多层网络中成立，且指数α与层数L相关（α=1/L），并发现不平衡初始化下需权重衰减。

Conclusion: NFA在多层线性网络中成立，但在某些非线性网络中不成立，实验结果支持理论分析。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

*Jixin Zhang,Yong Lai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于注意力增强的联合图神经网络（Attn-JGNN）模型，用于解决#SAT问题，显著提高了求解精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受迭代联合图传播（IJGP）算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法提升#SAT问题的求解准确性。

Method: 利用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，进行迭代消息传递，并通过学习分区函数近似模型数量；引入注意力机制优化关键变量和簇的关注。

Result: 实验表明，Attn-JGNN模型优于其他神经网络方法。

Conclusion: 注意力机制有效提升了求解精度，减少了冗余计算。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

### [152] [GRATING: Low-Latency and Memory-Efficient Semantic Selection on Device](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15620)
*Jiahao Zhou,Chengliang Lin,Dingji Li,Mingkai Dong,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一种无需训练的推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和双窗口滑动技术，显著降低语义Top-K选择的延迟和内存占用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘硬件上语义Top-K选择的高延迟和内存占用问题，提升AI服务的效率和可部署性。

Method: 提出全局视角的渐进式聚类剪枝（monolithic forwarding）和双窗口滑动技术（dual-layer sliding window）。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的模型上，GRATING将延迟降低89.0%，内存占用减少94.9%，且不影响精度。

Conclusion: GRATING显著提升了边缘AI应用的效率和可部署性，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

*Parsa Abbasi,Stefan Heindorf*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CQD-SHAP是一个新框架，通过Shapley值解释复杂查询中各部分对答案排名的贡献，提升用户信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经和神经符号CQA方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏对查询部分重要性的解释，CQD-SHAP旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算查询部分对答案排名的贡献，满足Shapley公理。

Result: 自动化评估显示，CQD-SHAP在多数查询类型中有效，提供了必要和充分的解释。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP通过解释查询部分的重要性，增强了神经预测器的可信度，优于纯符号方法。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

Abstract: We propose the first parameter-free decentralized online learning algorithms

coin-betting and decentralized online learning via gossip steps. To enable our
decentralized analysis, we introduce a novel "betting function" formulation for
coin-betting that simplifies the multi-agent regret analysis. Our analysis
shows sublinear network regret bounds and is validated through experiments on
synthetic and real datasets. This family of algorithms is applicable to
distributed sensing, decentralized optimization, and collaborative ML
applications.

*Ziqian Li,Kang Liu,Yongcun Song,Hangrui Yue,Enrique Zuazua*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NODE-ONet框架通过神经ODE结合物理知识，提升PDE求解的效率和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽视PDE的领域知识，导致难以捕捉时间动态和泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出NODE-ONet框架，包含编码器、神经ODE和解码器，并引入物理编码的神经ODE。

Result: 在非线性扩散反应和Navier-Stokes方程上表现出高精度、高效计算和超越训练时间范围的预测能力。

Conclusion: NODE-ONet是一个可扩展的、物理编码的科学机器学习工具，适用于多种PDE家族。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的Tsetlin Machine（TM）软件实现，通过位操作和提前退出机制显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TM的逻辑驱动操作适合现代CPU架构并行执行，但传统实现效率不足。

Method: 利用位操作压缩模型表示，引入提前退出机制和字面重排序策略。

Result: 实验显示推理时间减少96.71%，代码密度保持相当。

Conclusion: 优化后的TM在资源受限设备上高效且实用。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

TL;DR: WARP-LUTs是一种新型梯度方法，高效学习逻辑门组合，减少可训练参数，比DLGNs更快收敛且保持准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法无关模型（如DLGNs）训练成本高且难以泛化到多输入逻辑块，需改进。

Method: 提出WARP-LUTs，通过Walsh辅助松弛技术优化概率查找表，减少参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs收敛更快，准确率相当，且有望扩展至高输入逻辑块。

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs为高效部署FPGA及实时科学应用提供潜力。

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN框架通过自适应校准提升推理任务效率，减少采样次数并提高准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如Best-of-N）在增加采样次数时效率下降的问题。

Method: 提出CarBoN，分两阶段探索解空间并校准logits，通过温度和偏移向量优化推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024上，CarBoN减少4倍采样次数并提高准确性。

Conclusion: CarBoN框架高效且通用，适用于多种采样策略，无需LLM重新训练。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统FEM方法计算成本高，研究旨在开发一种快速、低成本的数据驱动方法，用于IPMSM转子形状分类。

Method: 使用KS-Net、Cubic SVM等算法对9000个样本进行10折交叉验证，评估准确率、精确率等指标。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM达到100%准确率，KS-Net为99.98%，证明数据驱动方法的高效性。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可替代FEM，加速电机设计，支持自动化转子识别和故障诊断。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CAP的算法，用于在约束特征空间中生成通用对抗扰动，提高了攻击成功率并减少了运行时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽略了领域特定的特征约束，导致生成的对抗样本不切实际或易被检测。

Method: 采用基于增广拉格朗日的极小极大优化问题，结合梯度交替优化策略。

Result: 在金融、IT网络和物理系统等多个领域验证了CAP的高效性和高攻击成功率。

Conclusion: CAP不仅适用于通用对抗扰动，还能扩展到个体对抗扰动，并通过数据学习特征约束，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是一种通过专家迭代和强化学习训练的语言模型，用于简化Lean证明，无需额外人工监督，显著缩短证明长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前神经定理证明生成的证明过长，难以理解且缺乏数学洞察力，而现有方法难以处理这些长证明，因此需要自动化的证明简化工具。

Method: ProofOptimizer通过专家迭代和强化学习训练，利用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号，采用迭代证明缩短工作流程。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，ProofOptimizer显著缩短了证明长度（miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，IMO 2025减少49%），同时提高了验证速度和下游证明器性能。

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督的Lean证明简化模型，有效解决了长证明难以理解的问题，并提升了验证效率和下游任务性能。

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

Motivation: 解决强化学习中的安全问题，提供形式化保障。

Method: 引入风险预算，使用成本批评器和屏蔽机制。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，训练时提供安全上限。

Conclusion: ProSh在训练和部署时均能保证安全性。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种可扩展、高效且无需人工干预的奖励建模替代方案，并具有收敛保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FEA计算成本高，不适合设计优化问题，深度学习模型可以解决这一问题，但需要选择高精度的架构。

Method: 使用GNNs和3D U-Nets作为FEA的替代方法，引入PINN框架，并采用课程学习策略（预训练后物理微调）。

Result: GNNs表现优于U-Net，其中MPNN和Graph Transformer精度最高，PINN显著提升泛化能力。MPNN PINN在性能和速度之间取得最佳平衡。

Conclusion: Graph Transformer最准确但速度较慢，MPNN PINN是最实用的解决方案，兼顾性能、模型大小和推理速度。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

TL;DR: PoultryFI是一个低成本、模块化的AI平台，通过六个模块优化家禽养殖的监控和决策，提升动物福利和生产效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中小型家禽养殖场缺乏经济实惠的集成工具，依赖人工检查，难以满足生产目标和合规要求。

Method: 结合进化算法优化摄像头布局，利用AI模块进行视听监控、实时蛋计数、预测和推荐。

Result: 试验显示100%的蛋计数准确率，可靠的异常检测和短期预测。

Conclusion: PoultryFI填补了试点工具与规模化农场智能之间的空白，帮助养殖者主动保障福利和盈利。

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，难以处理现实中的多变量和协变量场景，因此需要更通用的解决方案。

Method: Chronos-2采用组注意力机制，通过合成数据训练实现跨时间序列的信息共享，支持零样本预测。

Result: 在fev-bench等三个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，尤其在多变量和协变量任务中显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: Chronos-2的上下文学习能力使其成为无需调整即可直接应用的通用预测模型。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的快速发展需要更高效的优化技术，DiLoCo在非分布式环境中的表现激发了对其机制的深入研究。

Method: 提出Step-$K$ Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，优化训练过程。

Result: SNOO在非分布式环境下实现了1.5-2.5倍的算力增益，且模型规模越大效果越显著。

Conclusion: SNOO因其低计算和内存开销以及与模型分片的兼容性，成为多种内优化器的实用增强方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Motivation: 当前量子设备受噪声影响，可靠性降低，传统方法依赖间接指标（如电路深度或门数）无法直接优化过程保真度。

Method: 提出FIDDLE框架，包含高斯过程代理模型（用于有限样本下估计保真度）和强化学习模块（优化路由）。

Result: FIDDLE在多种噪声模型下显著提升量子电路的过程保真度，优于现有保真度估计和路由优化方法。

Conclusion: FIDDLE是首个直接优化过程保真度的框架，为量子计算可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种迁移学习提供了生物基础和可解释性，未来将通过实验验证其有效性。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Motivation: 传统RUMs中的IIA假设将所有人类偏好简化为单一效用函数，忽略了偏好的多样性。本文旨在解决这一局限性，探索更精细的建模方法。

Method: 研究基于相关probit模型，通过理论分析和实验验证，比较两两偏好数据与三选一偏好数据的效果。

Result: 理论证明两两偏好数据无法捕捉相关性，而三选一数据能有效克服这一缺陷，并提出了高效且接近最优的估计器。

Conclusion: 三选一偏好数据在建模人类偏好时更具优势，能显著提升个性化效果，实验验证了其在实际数据集中的有效性。

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Result: 在大型传输系统实验中，混合求解器实现了1000倍以上的加速，同时保证最大最优性差距为2%。

Conclusion: 混合求解器在速度和最优性之间取得了平衡，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

Abstract: This article presents a fully autonomous aerial masonry construction
framework using heterogeneous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), supported by
experimental validation. Two specialized UAVs were developed for the task: (i)
a brick-carrier UAV equipped with a ball-joint actuation mechanism for precise
brick manipulation, and (ii) an adhesion UAV integrating a servo-controlled
valve and extruder nozzle for accurate adhesion application. The proposed
framework employs a reactive mission planning unit that combines a dependency
graph of the construction layout with a conflict graph to manage simultaneous
task execution, while hierarchical state machines ensure robust operation and
safe transitions during task execution. Dynamic task allocation allows
real-time adaptation to environmental feedback, while minimum-jerk trajectory
generation ensures smooth and precise UAV motion during brick pickup and
placement. Additionally, the brick-carrier UAV employs an onboard vision system
that estimates brick poses in real time using ArUco markers and a least-squares
optimization filter, enabling accurate alignment during construction. To the
best of the authors' knowledge, this work represents the first experimental
demonstration of fully autonomous aerial masonry construction using
heterogeneous UAVs, where one UAV precisely places the bricks while another
autonomously applies adhesion material between them. The experimental results
supported by the video showcase the effectiveness of the proposed framework and
demonstrate its potential to serve as a foundation for future developments in
autonomous aerial robotic construction.

Result: 实验显示RM-RL收敛更快且更稳定，在真实操作中提升53%的平移精度和20%的旋转精度。

Conclusion: RM-RL在无需人类演示的情况下，成功执行高精度任务，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Precise robot manipulation is critical for fine-grained applications such as
chemical and biological experiments, where even small errors (e.g., reagent
spillage) can invalidate an entire task. Existing approaches often rely on
pre-collected expert demonstrations and train policies via imitation learning
(IL) or offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, obtaining high-quality
demonstrations for precision tasks is difficult and time-consuming, while
offline RL commonly suffers from distribution shifts and low data efficiency.
We introduce a Role-Model Reinforcement Learning (RM-RL) framework that unifies
online and offline training in real-world environments. The key idea is a
role-model strategy that automatically generates labels for online training
data using approximately optimal actions, eliminating the need for human
demonstrations. RM-RL reformulates policy learning as supervised training,
reducing instability from distribution mismatch and improving efficiency. A
hybrid training scheme further leverages online role-model data for offline
reuse, enhancing data efficiency through repeated sampling. Extensive
experiments show that RM-RL converges faster and more stably than existing RL
methods, yielding significant gains in real-world manipulation: 53% improvement
in translation accuracy and 20% in rotation accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate
the successful execution of a challenging task, precisely placing a cell plate
onto a shelf, highlighting the framework's effectiveness where prior methods
fail.

Abstract: This article presents an extension of the Lagrange-Poincare Equations (LPE)
to model the dynamics of spacecraft-manipulator systems operating within a
non-inertial orbital reference frame. Building upon prior formulations of LPE
for vehicle-manipulator systems, the proposed framework, termed the
Lagrange-Poincare-Kepler Equations (LPKE), incorporates the coupling between
spacecraft attitude dynamics, orbital motion, and manipulator kinematics. The
formalism combines the Euler-Poincare equations for the base spacecraft,
Keplerian orbital dynamics for the reference frame, and reduced Euler-Lagrange
equations for the manipulator's shape space, using an exponential joint
parametrization. Leveraging the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle on principal
bundles, we derive novel closed-form structural matrices that explicitly
capture the effects of orbital disturbances and their dynamic coupling with the
manipulator system. The LPKE framework also systematically includes externally
applied, symmetry-breaking wrenches, allowing for immediate integration into
hardware-in-the-loop simulations and model-based control architectures for
autonomous robotic operations in the orbital environment. To illustrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model and its numerical superiority, we present a
simulation study analyzing orbital effects on a 7-degree-of-freedom manipulator
mounted on a spacecraft.

Conclusion: 提出的多传感器融合系统显著提升了腿式机器人在复杂环境中的导航能力。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for legged robots in complex and dynamic environments
relies on robust simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) systems to
accurately map surroundings and localize the robot, ensuring safe and efficient
operation. While prior sensor fusion-based SLAM approaches have integrated
various sensor modalities to improve their robustness, these algorithms are
still susceptible to estimation drift in challenging environments due to their
reliance on unsuitable fusion strategies. Therefore, we propose a robust
LiDAR-visual-inertial-kinematic odometry system that integrates information
from multiple sensors, such as a camera, LiDAR, inertial measurement unit
(IMU), and joint encoders, for visual and LiDAR-based odometry estimation. Our
system employs a fusion-based pose estimation approach that runs
optimization-based visual-inertial-kinematic odometry (VIKO) and filter-based
LiDAR-inertial-kinematic odometry (LIKO) based on measurement availability. In
VIKO, we utilize the footpreintegration technique and robust LiDAR-visual depth
consistency using superpixel clusters in a sliding window optimization. In
LIKO, we incorporate foot kinematics and employ a point-toplane residual in an
error-state iterative Kalman filter (ESIKF). Compared with other sensor
fusion-based SLAM algorithms, our approach shows robust performance across
public and longterm datasets.

Conclusion: PolyFly通过精确建模和优化，显著提升了空中运输机器人在复杂环境中的飞行性能。

Abstract: Aerial transportation robots using suspended cables have emerged as versatile
platforms for disaster response and rescue operations. To maximize the
capabilities of these systems, robots need to aggressively fly through tightly
constrained environments, such as dense forests and structurally unsafe
buildings, while minimizing flight time and avoiding obstacles. Existing
methods geometrically over-approximate the vehicle and obstacles, leading to
conservative maneuvers and increased flight times. We eliminate these
restrictions by proposing PolyFly, an optimal global planner which considers a
non-conservative representation for aerial transportation by modeling each
physical component of the environment, and the robot (quadrotor, cable and
payload), as independent polytopes. We further increase the model accuracy by
incorporating the attitude of the physical components by constructing
orientation-aware polytopes. The resulting optimal control problem is
efficiently solved by converting the polytope constraints into smooth
differentiable constraints via duality theory. We compare our method against
the existing state-of-the-art approach in eight maze-like environments and show
that PolyFly produces faster trajectories in each scenario. We also
experimentally validate our proposed approach on a real quadrotor with a
suspended payload, demonstrating the practical reliability and accuracy of our
method.

Abstract: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim
thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for
disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of
the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of
information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates
into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives
saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication
infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely
difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate
and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as
valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be
dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data
collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless,
real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather
conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this,
we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of
a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the
UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem
to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures
complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth
motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the
practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for
real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results
demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making
post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective.

Abstract: Scene graphs enhance 3D mapping capabilities in robotics by understanding the
relationships between different spatial elements, such as rooms and objects.
Recent research extends scene graphs to hierarchical layers, adding and
leveraging constraints across these levels. This approach is tightly integrated
with pose-graph optimization, improving both localization and mapping accuracy
simultaneously. However, when segmenting spatial characteristics, consistently
recognizing rooms becomes challenging due to variations in viewpoints and
limited field of view (FOV) of sensors. For example, existing real-time
approaches often over-segment large rooms into smaller, non-functional spaces
that are not useful for localization and mapping due to the time-dependent
method. Conversely, their voxel-based room segmentation method often
under-segment in complex cases like not fully enclosed 3D space that are
non-traversable for ground robots or humans, leading to false constraints in
pose-graph optimization. We propose a traversability-aware room segmentation
method that considers the interaction between robots and surroundings, with
consistent feasibility of traversability information. This enhances both the
semantic coherence and computational efficiency of pose-graph optimization.
Improved performance is demonstrated through the re-detection frequency of the
same rooms in a dataset involving repeated traversals of the same space along
the same path, as well as the optimization time consumption.

Result: 仿真实验验证了高精度参数估计，真实机器人实验成功应用于颗粒模拟参数估计。

Conclusion: ASBI通过主动数据收集和NPE有效解决了黑盒模拟器参数估计问题。

Abstract: Black-box simulators are widely used in robotics, but optimizing their
parameters remains challenging due to inaccessible likelihoods.
Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) tackles this issue using simulation-driven
approaches, estimating the posterior from offline real observations and forward
simulations. However, in black-box scenarios, preparing observations that
contain sufficient information for parameter estimation is difficult due to the
unknown relationship between parameters and observations. In this work, we
present Active Simulation-Based Inference (ASBI), a parameter estimation
framework that uses robots to actively collect real-world online data to
achieve accurate black-box simulator tuning. Our framework optimizes robot
actions to collect informative observations by maximizing information gain,
which is defined as the expected reduction in Shannon entropy between the
posterior and the prior. While calculating information gain requires the
likelihood, which is inaccessible in black-box simulators, our method solves
this problem by leveraging Neural Posterior Estimation (NPE), which leverages a
neural network to learn the posterior estimator. Three simulation experiments
quantitatively verify that our method achieves accurate parameter estimation,
with posteriors sharply concentrated around the true parameters. Moreover, we
show a practical application using a real robot to estimate the simulation
parameters of cubic particles corresponding to two real objects, beads and
gravel, with a bucket pouring action.

Result: 在Gazebo模拟中，该方法比基线方法具有更高的目标到达率和更少的死锁，且计算资源需求低。

Conclusion: 该方法为资源受限的机器人提供了一种轻量级的导航解决方案，适用于非结构化环境中的可移动障碍物导航。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in disaster-response and other unstructured indoor
settings requires robots not only to avoid obstacles but also to recognise when
those obstacles can be pushed aside. We present an adaptive, LiDAR and
odometry-based path-planning framework that embeds this capability into the
ROS2 Nav2 stack. A new Movable Obstacles Layer labels all LiDAR returns missing
from a prior static map as tentatively movable and assigns a reduced traversal
cost. A companion Slow-Pose Progress Checker monitors the ratio of commanded to
actual velocity; when the robot slows appreciably, the local cost is raised
from light to heavy, and on a stall to lethal, prompting the global planner to
back out and re-route. Gazebo evaluations on a Scout Mini, spanning isolated
objects and cluttered corridors, show higher goal-reach rates and fewer
deadlocks than a no-layer baseline, with traversal times broadly comparable.
Because the method relies only on planar scans and CPU-level computation, it
suits resource-constrained search and rescue robots and integrates into
heterogeneous platforms with minimal engineering. Overall, the results indicate
that interaction-aware cost maps are a lightweight, ROS2-native extension for
navigating among potentially movable obstacles in unstructured settings. The
full implementation will be released as open source

swarm optimisation methods are unreliable. This paper presents NOAH, a novel
nature-inspired swarm optimisation algorithm that combines current-aware drift,
irreversible settlement in persistent sensing nodes, and colony-based
communication. Drawing inspiration from the behaviour of barnacle nauplii, NOAH
addresses the critical limitations of existing swarm algorithms by providing
hydrodynamic awareness, irreversible anchoring mechanisms, and colony-based
communication capabilities essential for underwater exploration missions. The
algorithm establishes a comprehensive foundation for scalable and
energy-efficient underwater swarm robotics with validated performance analysis.
Validation studies demonstrate an 86% success rate for permanent anchoring
scenarios, providing a unified formulation for hydrodynamic constraints and
irreversible settlement behaviours with an empirical study under flow.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在成功率和避免骨骼接触方面比现有开环切割基线提高了4倍。

Conclusion: 力反馈对多材料切割的安全性和有效性至关重要。

Abstract: Automating chicken shoulder deboning requires precise 6-DoF cutting through a
partially occluded, deformable, multi-material joint, since contact with the
bones presents serious health and safety risks. Our work makes both
systems-level and algorithmic contributions to train and deploy a reactive
force-feedback cutting policy that dynamically adapts a nominal trajectory and
enables full 6-DoF knife control to traverse the narrow joint gap while
avoiding contact with the bones. First, we introduce an open-source
custom-built simulator for multi-material cutting that models coupling,
fracture, and cutting forces, and supports reinforcement learning, enabling
efficient training and rapid prototyping. Second, we design a reusable physical
testbed to emulate the chicken shoulder: two rigid "bone" spheres with
controllable pose embedded in a softer block, enabling rigorous and repeatable
evaluation while preserving essential multi-material characteristics of the
target problem. Third, we train and deploy a residual RL policy, with
discretized force observations and domain randomization, enabling robust
zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and the first demonstration of a learned policy
that debones a real chicken shoulder. Our experiments in our simulator, on our
physical testbed, and on real chicken shoulders show that our learned policy
reliably navigates the joint gap and reduces undesired bone/cartilage contact,
resulting in up to a 4x improvement over existing open-loop cutting baselines
in terms of success rate and bone avoidance. Our results also illustrate the
necessity of force feedback for safe and effective multi-material cutting. The

Conclusion: VDRive通过状态-动作映射和强化学习框架，显著提升了自动驾驶的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: In autonomous driving, dynamic environment and corner cases pose significant
challenges to the robustness of ego vehicle's state understanding and decision
making. We introduce VDRive, a novel pipeline for end-to-end autonomous driving
that explicitly models state-action mapping to address these challenges,
enabling interpretable and robust decision making. By leveraging the
advancement of the state understanding of the Vision Language Action Model
(VLA) with generative diffusion policy-based action head, our VDRive guides the
driving contextually and geometrically. Contextually, VLA predicts future
observations through token generation pre-training, where the observations are
represented as discrete codes by a Conditional Vector Quantized Variational
Autoencoder (CVQ-VAE). Geometrically, we perform reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of the VLA to predict future trajectories and actions based on
current driving conditions. VLA supplies the current state tokens and predicted
state tokens for the action policy head to generate hierarchical actions and
trajectories. During policy training, a learned critic evaluates the actions
generated by the policy and provides gradient-based feedback, forming an
actor-critic framework that enables a reinforcement-based policy learning
pipeline. Experiments show that our VDRive achieves state-of-the-art
performance in the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark and nuScenes open-loop
planning.

Conclusion: 提案生成质量是关键，改进方法在交互性强和分布外场景中达到新最优结果。

Abstract: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been
treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing
shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated
Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and
adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this
integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we
investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely
adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with
relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which
includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our
analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead
to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to
fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality
proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We
find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic
and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following
approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced
proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but
realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach
significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution
and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results.

Conclusion: VO-DP展示了仅视觉方法的潜力，并开源了支持多机多GPU训练的机器人操作库。

Abstract: In the context of imitation learning, visuomotor-based diffusion policy
learning is one of the main directions in robotic manipulation. Most of these
approaches rely on point clouds as observation inputs and construct scene
representations through point clouds feature learning, which enables them to
achieve remarkable accuracy. However, the existing literature lacks an in-depth
exploration of vision-only solutions that have significant potential. In this
paper, we propose a Vision-Only and single-view Diffusion Policy learning
method (VO-DP) that leverages pretrained visual foundation models to achieve
effective fusion of semantic and geometric features. We utilize intermediate
features from VGGT incorporating semantic features from DINOv2 and geometric
features from Alternating Attention blocks. Features are fused via
cross-attention and spatially compressed with a CNN to form the input to the
policy head. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VO-DP not only outperforms
the vision-only baseline DP significantly but also exhibits distinct
performance trends against the point cloud-based method DP3: in simulation
tasks, VO-DP achieves an average success rate of 64.6% on par with DP3 64.0%
and far higher than DP 34.8%, while in real-world tasks, it reaches 87.9%,
outperforming both DP3 67.5% and DP 11.2% by a notable margin. Further
robustness evaluations confirm that VO-DP remains highly stable under varying
conditions including color, size, background, and lighting. Lastly, we
open-source a training library for robotic manipulation. Built on Accelerate,
this library supports multi-machine and multi-GPU parallel training, as well as
mixed precision training. It is compatible with visuomotor policies such as DP,
DP3 and VO-DP, and also supports the RoboTwin simulator.

Conclusion: 新方法在时变干扰场景下显著优于传统扩展卡尔曼滤波干扰观测器。

Abstract: The nominal performance of mechanical systems is often degraded by unknown
disturbances. A two-degree-of-freedom control structure can decouple nominal
performance from disturbance rejection. However, perfect disturbance rejection
is unattainable when the disturbance dynamic is unknown. In this work, we
reveal an inherent trade-off in disturbance estimation subject to tracking
speed and tracking uncertainty. Then, we propose two novel methods to enhance
disturbance estimation: an interacting multiple model extended Kalman
filter-based disturbance observer and a multi-kernel correntropy extended
Kalman filter-based disturbance observer. Experiments on an exoskeleton verify
that the proposed two methods improve the tracking accuracy $36.3\%$ and
$16.2\%$ in hip joint error, and $46.3\%$ and $24.4\%$ in knee joint error,
respectively, compared to the extended Kalman filter-based disturbance
observer, in a time-varying interaction force scenario, demonstrating the
superiority of the proposed method.

Abstract: We provide an algorithm for adaptive legged locomotion via online learning
and model predictive control. The algorithm is composed of two interacting
modules: model predictive control (MPC) and online learning of residual
dynamics. The residual dynamics can represent modeling errors and external
disturbances. We are motivated by the future of autonomy where quadrupeds will
autonomously perform complex tasks despite real-world unknown uncertainty, such
as unknown payload and uneven terrains. The algorithm uses random Fourier
features to approximate the residual dynamics in reproducing kernel Hilbert
spaces. Then, it employs MPC based on the current learned model of the residual
dynamics. The model is updated online in a self-supervised manner using least
squares based on the data collected while controlling the quadruped. The
algorithm enjoys sublinear \textit{dynamic regret}, defined as the
suboptimality against an optimal clairvoyant controller that knows how the
residual dynamics. We validate our algorithm in Gazebo and MuJoCo simulations,
where the quadruped aims to track reference trajectories. The Gazebo
simulations include constant unknown external forces up to $12\boldsymbol{g}$,
where $\boldsymbol{g}$ is the gravity vector, in flat terrain, slope terrain
with $20\degree$ inclination, and rough terrain with $0.25m$ height variation.
The MuJoCo simulations include time-varying unknown disturbances with payload
up to $8~kg$ and time-varying ground friction coefficients in flat terrain.

Abstract: This paper introduces an anthropomorphic robot hand built entirely using LEGO
MINDSTORMS: the Educational SoftHand-A, a tendon-driven, highly-underactuated
robot hand based on the Pisa/IIT SoftHand and related hands. To be suitable for
an educational context, the design is constrained to use only standard LEGO
pieces with tests using common equipment available at home. The hand features
dual motors driving an agonist/antagonist opposing pair of tendons on each
finger, which are shown to result in reactive fine control. The finger motions
are synchonized through soft synergies, implemented with a differential
mechanism using clutch gears. Altogether, this design results in an
anthropomorphic hand that can adaptively grasp a broad range of objects using a
simple actuation and control mechanism. Since the hand can be constructed from
LEGO pieces and uses state-of-the-art design concepts for robotic hands, it has
the potential to educate and inspire children to learn about the frontiers of
modern robotics.

Abstract: This paper presents the integration of a Variable Stiffness Link (VSL) for
long-reach aerial manipulation, enabling adaptable mechanical coupling between
an aerial multirotor platform and a dual-arm manipulator. Conventional
long-reach manipulation systems rely on rigid or cable connections, which limit
precision or transmit disturbances to the aerial vehicle. The proposed VSL
introduces an adjustable stiffness mechanism that allows the link to behave
either as a flexible rope or as a rigid rod, depending on task requirements.
  The system is mounted on a quadrotor equipped with the LiCAS dual-arm
manipulator and evaluated through teleoperated experiments, involving external
disturbances and parcel transportation tasks. Results demonstrate that varying
the link stiffness significantly modifies the dynamic interaction between the
UAV and the payload. The flexible configuration attenuates external impacts and
aerodynamic perturbations, while the rigid configuration improves positional
accuracy during manipulation phases.
  These results confirm that VSL enhances versatility and safety, providing a
controllable trade-off between compliance and precision. Future work will focus
on autonomous stiffness regulation, multi-rope configurations, cooperative
aerial manipulation and user studies to further assess its impact on
teleoperated and semi-autonomous aerial tasks.

Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound (US) imaging using conventional 2D probes offers
flexibility and accessibility for diverse clinical applications but faces
challenges in accurate probe pose estimation. Traditional methods depend on
costly tracking systems, while neural network-based methods struggle with image
noise and error accumulation, compromising reconstruction precision. We propose
a cost-effective and versatile solution that leverages lightweight cameras and
visual servoing in simulated environments for precise 3D US imaging. These
cameras capture visual feedback from a textured planar workspace. To counter
occlusions and lighting issues, we introduce an image restoration method that
reconstructs occluded regions by matching surrounding texture patterns. For
pose estimation, we develop a simulation-in-the-loop approach, which replicates
the system setup in simulation and iteratively minimizes pose errors between
simulated and real-world observations. A visual servoing controller refines the
alignment of camera views, improving translational estimation by optimizing
image alignment. Validations on a soft vascular phantom, a 3D-printed conical
model, and a human arm demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of our approach,
with Hausdorff distances to the reference reconstructions of 0.359 mm, 1.171
mm, and 0.858 mm, respectively. These results confirm the method's potential
for reliable freehand 3D US reconstruction.

Conclusion: HEADER通过创新的地图表示和奖励设计，在大规模环境中实现了高效且近最优的探索行为。

Abstract: This work pushes the boundaries of learning-based methods in autonomous robot
exploration in terms of environmental scale and exploration efficiency. We
present HEADER, an attention-based reinforcement learning approach with
hierarchical graphs for efficient exploration in large-scale environments.
HEADER follows existing conventional methods to construct hierarchical
representations for the robot belief/map, but further designs a novel
community-based algorithm to construct and update a global graph, which remains
fully incremental, shape-adaptive, and operates with linear complexity.
Building upon attention-based networks, our planner finely reasons about the
nearby belief within the local range while coarsely leveraging distant
information at the global scale, enabling next-best-viewpoint decisions that
consider multi-scale spatial dependencies. Beyond novel map representation, we
introduce a parameter-free privileged reward that significantly improves model
performance and produces near-optimal exploration behaviors, by avoiding
training objective bias caused by handcrafted reward shaping. In simulated
challenging, large-scale exploration scenarios, HEADER demonstrates better
scalability than most existing learning and non-learning methods, while
achieving a significant improvement in exploration efficiency (up to 20%) over
state-of-the-art baselines. We also deploy HEADER on hardware and validate it
in complex, large-scale real-life scenarios, including a 300m*230m campus
environment.

Result: 实验表明，DDACE在少样本条件下成功执行任务，并在动态多样环境中有效泛化。

Conclusion: 模块化架构增强了多机器人系统在实际应用中的实用性和扩展性。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel few-shot learning framework for multi-robot
systems that integrate both spatial and temporal elements: Few-Shot
Demonstration-Driven Task Coordination and Trajectory Execution (DDACE). Our
approach leverages temporal graph networks for learning task-agnostic temporal
sequencing and Gaussian Processes for spatial trajectory modeling, ensuring
modularity and generalization across various tasks. By decoupling temporal and
spatial aspects, DDACE requires only a small number of demonstrations,
significantly reducing data requirements compared to traditional learning from
demonstration approaches. To validate our proposed framework, we conducted
extensive experiments in task environments designed to assess various aspects
of multi-robot coordination-such as multi-sequence execution, multi-action
dynamics, complex trajectory generation, and heterogeneous configurations. The
experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully achieves task
execution under few-shot learning conditions and generalizes effectively across
dynamic and diverse settings. This work underscores the potential of modular
architectures in enhancing the practicality and scalability of multi-robot
systems in real-world applications. Additional materials are available at

Abstract: We present DexCanvas, a large-scale hybrid real-synthetic human manipulation
dataset containing 7,000 hours of dexterous hand-object interactions seeded
from 70 hours of real human demonstrations, organized across 21 fundamental
manipulation types based on the Cutkosky taxonomy. Each entry combines
synchronized multi-view RGB-D, high-precision mocap with MANO hand parameters,
and per-frame contact points with physically consistent force profiles. Our
real-to-sim pipeline uses reinforcement learning to train policies that control
an actuated MANO hand in physics simulation, reproducing human demonstrations
while discovering the underlying contact forces that generate the observed
object motion. DexCanvas is the first manipulation dataset to combine
large-scale real demonstrations, systematic skill coverage based on established
taxonomies, and physics-validated contact annotations. The dataset can
facilitate research in robotic manipulation learning, contact-rich control, and
skill transfer across different hand morphologies.
