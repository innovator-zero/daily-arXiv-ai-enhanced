We evaluate\nVAR-SLAM on the TUM RGB-D, Bonn RGB-D Dynamic, and OpenLORIS datasets, which\ninclude both known and unknown moving objects.

While active vision strategies that steer onboard cameras have been\nproposed to expand sensing coverage, most existing methods separate motion\nplanning from sensing considerations, resulting in less effective and delayed\nobstacle response. To address this limitation, we introduce SPOT\n(Sensing-augmented Planning via Obstacle Threat modeling), a unified planning\nframework for observation-aware trajectory planning that explicitly\nincorporates sensing objectives into motion optimization. At the core of our\nmethod is a Gaussian Process-based obstacle belief map, which establishes a\nunified probabilistic representation of both recognized (previously observed)\nand potential obstacles.

For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant\npatterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.\nExperiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show\nthat PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of\n8.30\\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\\% improvement in accuracy,\ndemonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of\nharmful memes.", "AI": {"tldr": "PatMD\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u7f13\u89e3\u8bef\u5224\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u5bb3\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u56e0\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u56e0\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u542b\u6709\u5bb3\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bef\u5224\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u8bef\u5224\u98ce\u9669\u6a21\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6307\u5bfcMLLM\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u57285\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747F1-score\u63d0\u53478.30%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53477.71%\u3002", "conclusion": "PatMD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u5bb3\u6a21\u56e0\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

It\nfeatures a palm and two mechanically identical and symmetrically arranged\nfingers, which can be driven independently or by a single motor. The fingertips\nof the fingers follow a linear motion trajectory, facilitating the grasping of\nobjects of various sizes on a tabletop without the need to adjust the overall\nheight of the gripper. Traditional industrial grippers with parallel gripping\ncapabilities often exhibit an arcuate motion at the fingertips, requiring the\nentire robotic arm to adjust its height to avoid collisions with the tabletop.\nThe SPD gripper, with its linear parallel gripping mechanism, effectively\naddresses this issue. Furthermore, the SPD gripper possesses adaptive\ncapabilities, accommodating objects of different shapes and sizes. This paper\npresents the design philosophy, fundamental composition principles, and\noptimization analysis theory of the SPD gripper.

To address these issues, we\npropose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a\nShape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large\nseparable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a\nStrip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and\npooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale\nEnhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a\ndedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object\ndetection.

Here, we consider more complex free-text queries with spatial\nrelationships, such as \"find the remote on the table\" while still leveraging\nrobustness of a semantic map.

Extensive\nevaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a\n$2.49\\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements\nin accelerating PEFT for LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aLong Exposure\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Shadowy Sparsity\u52a0\u901f\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u5fae\u8c03\uff08PEFT\uff09\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709PEFT\u6280\u672f\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e0a\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0cShadowy Sparsity\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "Long Exposure\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aShadowy-sparsity Exposer\u3001Sequence-oriented Predictor\u548cDynamic-aware Operator\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u7528\u4e8e\u6355\u6349\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u7a00\u758f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLong Exposure\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u63d0\u901f2.49\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Long Exposure\u4e3aLLMs\u7684PEFT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL\nprocess in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two\ncritical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and\nintegrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing\nresearch focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices\nsource domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a\nfine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains).

A promising approach is to reconstruct\nvisual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging\n(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a\nlatent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct\nimages. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is\nto the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces\nimages from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best\nsupports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual\nstimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more\nsimilar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based\nspace or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the\ngenerative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of\nvisual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and\nrelationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that\nProjects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate\nrepresentation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric\ndiffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to\nreduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module\nthat automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align\nwith the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets\ndemonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an\n8% reduction in perceptual loss.

Specifically, the core of OmniVIC is a self-improving\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) and in-context learning (ICL), where RAG\nretrieves relevant prior experiences from a structured memory bank to inform\nthe controller about similar past tasks, and ICL leverages these retrieved\nexamples and the prompt of current task to query the VLM for generating\ncontext-aware and adaptive impedance parameters for the current manipulation\nscenario. Therefore, a self-improved RAG and ICL guarantee OmniVIC works in\nuniversal task scenarios.

This work addresses the\nchallenge of descriptively identifying a unique \"signature\" (local point cloud)\nby leveraging a detectable, high-precision \"anchor\" (like a pole). To solve\nthis, we propose a novel canonical representation, \"Pole-Image,\" as a hybrid\nmethod that uses poles as anchors to generate signatures from the surrounding\n3D structure.

The\nkey advantage of pole landmarks is that \"detection\" is extremely easy. This\nease of detection allows the robot to easily track the same pole, enabling the\nautomatic and large-scale collection of diverse observational data (positive\npairs).

When this happens, the predictions of an\nML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome\nand undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML\nsystems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be\ncritical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal\nwith this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability\ndistribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this\ndeviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov\n(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance\ncan be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's\nperformance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable\nstatistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More\nspecifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about\n50\\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement\nLearning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test\nand KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step\nforward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and\nthis, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a\nmore informed manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) \u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528KS\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5bf9AI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7fKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a0.02\uff0c\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u4ea4\u53c9\u8def\u53e3\u7684\u65c5\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a050%\u3002", "conclusion": "KS\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548cKS\u8ddd\u79bb\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4bAI\u4ee3\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9AI\u4ee3\u7406\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

This has created a void in the\nunderstanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive\nimages. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning\n(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the\nsignificant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder\nas well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of\ntraining strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in\nstrongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a\ncritical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through\ndiverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and\nsegmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's\npost-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on\nMLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual\nrepresentations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces\nstronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,\nboosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our\nfindings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,\nPreference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,\na PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained\ncounterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of\nstandard vision pretraining.

Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state\nvariables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them\nuniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach\nprevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a\nsignificant degradation in detection performance after state variables are\nintegrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel\nSTate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance\nthe capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the\nfine-tuning stage.

However, this\nparadigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,\nparticularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three\naspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,\nproduction typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging\nenvironments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the\nscarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass\nIndividualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first\nbenchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,\nMIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse\nindividualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected\nfrom six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial\nimaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion\nconditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nanomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and\nzero-shot approaches.

This paper\npresents iWatchRoadv2, a fully automated end-to-end platform for real-time\npothole detection, GPS-based geotagging, and dynamic road health visualization\nusing OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a self-annotated dataset of over 7,000\ndashcam frames capturing diverse Indian road conditions, weather patterns, and\nlighting scenarios, which we used to fine-tune the Ultralytics YOLO model for\naccurate pothole detection. The system synchronizes OCR-extracted video\ntimestamps with external GPS logs to precisely geolocate each detected pothole,\nenriching detections with comprehensive metadata, including road segment\nattribution and contractor information managed through an optimized backend\ndatabase. iWatchRoadv2 introduces intelligent governance features that enable\nauthorities to link road segments with contract metadata through a secure login\ninterface. The system automatically sends alerts to contractors and officials\nwhen road health deteriorates, supporting automated accountability and warranty\nenforcement. The intuitive web interface delivers actionable analytics to\nstakeholders and the public, facilitating evidence-driven repair planning,\nbudget allocation, and quality assessment. Our cost-effective and scalable\nsolution streamlines frame processing and storage while supporting seamless\npublic engagement for urban and rural deployments.

Existing 3D\nsegmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based\ninstructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack\nintrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an\ninnovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based\nsegmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform\nsegmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on\ntheir ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for\nMLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM\ncan lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel\nGlobal-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views\nare first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,\naggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several\nclose-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained\nlocal segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive\nexperiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting\nboth explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly\nintroduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly\nsupports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,\nreplacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and\nversatility.

The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered\nconsiderable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous\ndetection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these\ndetection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network\n(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited\ncontrol over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the\nheterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the\nfirst adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot\ncontrol attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.\nSpecifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts\nby reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby\nevading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving\nsocial bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social\naccounts based on their influence and budget.

This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection\n(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model\n(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes\nalongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach\nfirst incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)\nto extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing\nrich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we\nconstruct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which\nintroduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process\nto achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress\nhallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In\naddition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset\n(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality\ncontrol, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding\nperformance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and\nits ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.\nCompared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior\nsolution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08EDVD\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86EDVD-LLaMA\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u900f\u660e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faST-SIT\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548cFg-MCoT\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408ER-FF++\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u53cc\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "EDVD-LLaMA\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u8de8\u4f2a\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing visual prompt tuning\nmethods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation\nspace--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these\nlimitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce\nsettings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we\nintroduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances\nadaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically\ninformative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel\nrepresentational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its\nsimplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight\noperations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and\ndataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning.

To bridge this gap, we introduce RoboBench, a benchmark\nthat systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) as\nembodied brains. Motivated by the critical roles across the full manipulation\npipeline, RoboBench defines five dimensions-instruction comprehension,\nperception reasoning, generalized planning, affordance prediction, and failure\nanalysis-spanning 14 capabilities, 25 tasks, and 6092 QA pairs. To ensure\nrealism, we curate datasets across diverse embodiments, attribute-rich objects,\nand multi-view scenes, drawing from large-scale real robotic data. For\nplanning, RoboBench introduces an evaluation framework,\nMLLM-as-world-simulator. It evaluate embodied feasibility by simulating whether\npredicted plans can achieve critical object-state changes. Experiments on 14\nMLLMs reveal fundamental limitations: difficulties with implicit instruction\ncomprehension, spatiotemporal reasoning, cross-scenario planning, fine-grained\naffordance understanding, and execution failure diagnosis. RoboBench provides a\ncomprehensive scaffold to quantify high-level cognition, and guide the\ndevelopment of next-generation embodied MLLMs. The project page is in\nhttps://robo-bench.github.io.", "AI": {"tldr": "RoboBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8ba4\u77e5\u6838\u5fc3\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c14\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9ad8\u5c42\u9762\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u6307\u4ee4\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u529f\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\uff09\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b14\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u300125\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c6092\u4e2aQA\u5bf9\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524dMLLMs\u5728\u9690\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u65f6\u7a7a\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u89c4\u5212\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RoboBench\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u5c42\u9762\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3MLLMs\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002"}}

The system combines semantic\nsegmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,\nscene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS\nor expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale\nfactor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into\naccurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane\ndetection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of\n14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a\ncolor-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a\nlightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time\nsemantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be\nreplaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model.

This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder\nto focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation\nreinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual\nobjects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text\nDescriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional\nreasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a\ntoken-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder\nreconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original\ncaption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns\nparaphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model\nderived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the\nstate-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning\nbenchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up\nto 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including\nNegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.\nQuantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --\nreconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former\nencourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,\nwhile the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed\nwith different wording.", "AI": {"tldr": "READ\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6dfb\u52a0\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u8bcd\u800c\u975e\u5176\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "READ\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\uff1atoken\u7ea7\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "READ-CLIP\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u53474.1%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u4e92\u8865\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u589e\u5f3a\u5355\u8bcd\u5173\u7cfb\u6355\u6349\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

While debiasing learning has been\nextensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called\ncounterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,\nsignificantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test\nenvironment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test\nenvironment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual\ntest emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test\nfocuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is\ndesirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only\none. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive\nPreference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences\nwith dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed\nto drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.\nEmploying a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased\nmodel, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected\nfeedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through\nself-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its\nknowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce\nmore accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,\nthereby improving performance in the counterfactual test.

Recently, large language\nmodels (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for\ngrounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address\nthe challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing\nmethods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context\nwindow, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we\npropose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of\nthe 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide\na query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can\nretrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on\ninstruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against\nbaseline context window and code generation methods.

We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --\ndefined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and\nrepresent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),\nwe perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between\nsites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by\nincorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as\nnodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a\nfederated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user\nsensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset\nof 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that\nPassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further\nvalidate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over\nother state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse\nlikelihood as actionable risk scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "PassREfinder-FL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u8de8\u7f51\u7ad9\u7684\u5bc6\u7801\u91cd\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bc6\u7801\u91cd\u7528\u653b\u51fb\u65f6\u5bf9\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7f51\u7ad9\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5bc6\u7801\u91cd\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8fdb\u884c\u94fe\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u62a4\u7528\u6237\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u52300.9153\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "PassREfinder-FL\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u5bc6\u7801\u91cd\u7528\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u5206\u3002"}}

Safe reinforcement learning\nprovides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being\na popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially\ndepends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, which governs the\ntrade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update\nthe multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in\npractice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an\nautomated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we\nanalyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe\nreinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\\lambda$-profiles\nthat give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and\nconstraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly\nsensitive nature of $\\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general\nintuition for choosing the optimal value $\\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally\nshow that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even\nexceed the optimal performance found at $\\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference\nin their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier\nupdates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated\nthrough PID-controlled updates.

Increasing the number of\nexamples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs\nhigher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to\nimprove the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing\nthe many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to\ngenerate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing\nprompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and\nsimply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve\neffective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more\ntrainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot\nrepresentations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression\nby providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these\ninsights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method.

We establish a\nlast-iterate convergence rate for $\\mathbb{E}[\\|Q_k - Q^*\\|_\\infty^2]$,\nimplying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ for achieving\n$\\mathbb{E}[\\|Q_k - Q^*\\|_\\infty] \\le \\epsilon$, matching that of off-policy\nQ-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We\nalso derive an explicit rate for $\\mathbb{E}[\\|Q^{\\pi_k} - Q^*\\|_\\infty^2]$,\nwhere $\\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal\nthat on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy\ncounterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an\noptimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our\ntheory.\n  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce\nrapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on\nexploration presents significant analytical challenges.

In\nthis work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential\nbasis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made\nat irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based\npredictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state\nrepresentation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular\nobservations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)\nobservation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state\nusing learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous\ntime. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on\nnext-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can\nindeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Although global products such\nas the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef\ndistri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision\nand semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary\ndelineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel\nse-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under\nnoisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN\narchitecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)\nblock in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic\nstructures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a\ncoral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming\nconventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting.

Inspired by Neural\nOrdinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth\nformulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural\nODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This\ncontinuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the\nadjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and\naccuracy through adaptive ODE solvers.

We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with\npoint-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).\nReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional\nsite from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level\nhard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,\nwhich are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not\nML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global\nscale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source\nbenchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and\n(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain\ngeneralization.

The current\nwidely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing\ntime and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,\nincluding near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and\nimage-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from\nvarious sources. Variability in the source material can alter data\ndistributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,\nthere is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of\nsource variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture\nfeatures have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on\nthis, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct\ntexture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture\ncontent. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five\ntexture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms\nindividual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust\nmoisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist\nthat utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of\nwood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We\nalso proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual\ninformation. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains\nby 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted\nmodels.

However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In\ncontrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian\ndisks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains\ncompromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality\nrendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both\ngeometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently\nunfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that\nuses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while\nmaintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians\nwith the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D\nGaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place\ncloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R\nmodel with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the\noriginal 2DGS, our method requires only 1\\% more storage and minimal additional\ntraining time.

Persistent contrails can evolve into\ncirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative\nforcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2\nemissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and\ndissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed\ncontrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as\ncontrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due\nto limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform\nbefore detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using\nground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high\nspatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually\ndistinct.

Thus, apparent success suggests that\nLLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical\nstatistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly\nreason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization\nconcerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue\nthat realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)\ndeveloping robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to\nguard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine\nLLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage\nevaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We\noutline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent\npublications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and\npreventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.\nCompared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,\nthey perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for\nstatistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as\npriors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both\nLLM-only and purely statistical methods.

With the increasing volume and\nvariety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation\nmodels (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early\npotential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial\ninter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse\nelectrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open\nchallenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse\nEEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG\nsignals.

Evaluated on\nthree CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on\nMilan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to\nsensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for\nreliable ADL recognition in smart homes.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08SICA\uff09\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u89e6\u53d1\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6d41\u4e2d\u65e5\u5e38\u6d3b\u52a8\uff08ADL\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u538b\u7f29\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u626d\u66f2\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e03\u5c40\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCARE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aCASAS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cCARE\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523089.8%\u300188.9%\u548c73.3%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CARE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86ADL\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Moreover, they process the full\nvideo offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online\ndecisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without\ntraining. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent\nLarge Multimodal Models (LMMs).

The ideal goal is Retrain\nEquivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the\nretained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data\nbatches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each\nstage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM\nfine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory\nand experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a\nfundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the\noutcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the\nforget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is\ninfluenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it\nimpossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain\nEquivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM\npost-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,\nNPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms.

In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as\na signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of\nmicro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process\ngrounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or\nthinking through an answer). We further observe that once this \"thinking\"\nprocess is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by\nreducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more\ncertain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,\ntheoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at\ninference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during\ninference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the\nvalue cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable\ncontroller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any\ndataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration\nand exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our\nproposed method achieves significant improvements over the base\ninstruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the\ngap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any\ntraining, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced\nby 58.6% compared to the RL model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faV-Reason\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f18\u5316LMM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684RL\u548c\u5197\u957f\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u71b5\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c0f\u578b\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f18\u5316LMM\u7684\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\uff0c\u8c03\u6574\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u5fae\u89c2\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1RL\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u5dee\u8ddd0.6%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1158.6%\u7684\u8f93\u51fatoken\u3002", "conclusion": "V-Reason\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002"}}

Whilst face preprocessing is a\ncritical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,\nwe observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.\nOur study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box\nstate-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different\npreprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice\nof face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,\nwhereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively\nminimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial\npreprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the\nunintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.\nBased on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using\ninput transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks\nby up to 27%.

This stems from plankton's complex\nmorphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel\nspecies, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid\nadvancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton\nrecognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision\ndevelopments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address\nthis, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating\nvarious distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset\n\\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection\nmethods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM\n\\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our\nconstructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with\nsubstantial improvements in key metrics.

Scaling them\nto improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and\ncompute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive\ndecoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation\nwithout bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve\nexpressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of\nweaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer\nvariant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to\nstrengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the\nsecond block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very\nfirst layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections\nand V cache by nearly 50 \\%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed\nfirst-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression\nand accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of\nTransformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model\nscales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \\% in\nKV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention\n(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe\nfor uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only\n10-15\\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine\nadvanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to\nachieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement.

In this work,\nwe present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the\nnon-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.\n  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand\nand face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we\npropose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose\ntracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.\nSecond, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,\nmaking them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we\nlearn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand\ninteraction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of\nPCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,\ninspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that\nprovides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration\nartifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.\n  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.\nAdditionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a\nsynthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions.

Each year, they swallow whole villages and\nvast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing\nthousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,\nbeen a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful\ngeneral-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted\nto this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset\n- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of\nBangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur\nUnion, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,\nthis dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements\nthat have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple\ncolor-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and\nthen fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of\nriverbank erosion.

In practice, SFT on a full dataset\nis computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias\namplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which\nprioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online\nbatch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the\ntraining process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on\nthe utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors\nlike diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or\nvalidation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset\ntraining. To address these limitations, this work develops \\textbf{UDS\n(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection\nin SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both\ndata utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample\ndiversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a\nlightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the\nneed for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing\ncomputational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that\nUDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods\nunder varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to\nfull-dataset fine-tuning.

Lam"], "title": "Exploring The Missing Semantics In Event Modality", "comment": null, "summary": "Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic\nrange, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction\n(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly\nfor reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due\nto the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,\nignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic\ninformation in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a\ncrucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by\nexisting E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V\nframework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality\nand leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,\nSemantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to\ntransfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation\nmodel, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning\nthe high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned\nsemantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)\nblock to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event\nrepresentations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.\nFurther, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a\nnovel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct\nsemantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels.

This\nadditional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to\nAdam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic\nOrthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to\nmatrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization\nto maintain training stability at scale.

Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset\ndemonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,\nrepeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of\n0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003\n(correct matches).", "AI": {"tldr": "DeepDetect\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u79cd\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578bESPNet\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u548c\u5339\u914d\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff08\u5982SIFT\u3001SURF\uff09\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SuperPoint\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5bf9\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0cDeepDetect\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u54087\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u548c2\u79cd\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578bESPNet\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Oxford Affine Covariant Regions\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDeepDetect\u5728\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff080.5143\uff09\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u6027\uff080.9582\uff09\u548c\u6b63\u786e\u5339\u914d\u6570\uff0859,003\uff09\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "DeepDetect\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u5316\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

Prior work in\nnonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary\nsignals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of\nconditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore\nstructural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,\nto relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence\nComponent Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the\nmixing function's Jacobian.

Prior work\naddresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\\emph{i.e.}, the point\ncloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints\n(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal\nthat initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable\nperformance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield\nonly modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's\nprimacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse\nviews due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed\npoints. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it\nfails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)\nfrequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view\naugmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS\nself-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,\ncompensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)\npoint-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform\nspatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean\nand reliable point cloud.

In each round, the learner selects a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a\nset $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\\boldsymbol{y}_t \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\\langle \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_t\n\\rangle \\in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,\nincluding extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask\nlearning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is\nwell known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after\n$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal\nacross all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X\n\\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log\nd}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log\nd}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm.

Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to\nestablish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path\nproblems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial\ndomains.

We challenge this\nprerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits\nguidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach\ndynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic\nforward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.\nWe demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also\nestablishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that\nthe benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aIn-situ Autoguidance\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8f85\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u727a\u7272\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u4f7f\u7528\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u52a3\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u6821\u6b63\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization\nschemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and\ndatasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and\nadaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with\nrespect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training\nprocess, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to\nensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global\nconsistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising\nerror in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and\nglobal consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we\nachieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer\nto our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly\nimprove the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative\nperformance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.\nMoreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants.

ControlValve\n(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)\nenforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual\nrules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ControlValve\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u56fe\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u52ab\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5982LlamaFirewall\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u9f50\u68c0\u67e5\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0e\u529f\u80fd\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faControlValve\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5141\u8bb8\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u56fe\u5e76\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u89c4\u5219\u3002", "result": "ControlValve\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u52ab\u6301\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "conclusion": "ControlValve\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is\nchallenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class\ndifferences. Many deep learning models operate as \"black boxes,\" limiting\nclinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based\nframework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to\nenhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and\ninterpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates\n(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment\nlesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the\noriginal image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via\nmulti-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on\nsalient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module\nincorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We\nevaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019\nchallenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation\nperformance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC\ncompared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use\nGradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.\nThese visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the\nlesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features.

However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong\nediting strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation\nbecomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual\nerrors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global\nconsistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as\ntexture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.\nRecently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant\nimprovements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for\nintegrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for\novercoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an\nin-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention\nmechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention\ncontrol method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates\nvision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and\ndifferentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce\nconsistent, prompt-aligned edits.

To further improve optimization stability and\nrobustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,\ninput perturbation, and convex output combination techniques.

There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both\nissues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be\nbeneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the\nsuboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing\nthrough a global measure -- spectral gap $\\lambda$ -- and prove that the\nincrease of $\\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input\nfeatures, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated\nby such theoretical insights, we propose a \\textbf{local} approach that\nadaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,\nwe connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel\nnonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and\noversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with\nlocal bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees.

Embedding geological knowledge directly\ninto predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables\njust that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train\ngenerative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores\nwhether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning\nalgorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be\ninverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to\nthree test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,\nespecially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the\ntraining data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it\nis entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not\nnecessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent\noverparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during\ntraining, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning\nthe GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to\nacceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data.

This insight allows\nus to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning\nrate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is\novercome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global\nminimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time\nwith a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)\nthe supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with\nlinear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat\nglobal minimum.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4ec5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6b65\u957f\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e38\u5728\u5927\u6b65\u957f\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5e73\u5766\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u96c6\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5c06\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5e73\u884c\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u9ece\u66fc\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5206\u53c9\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6536\u655b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u4e9a\u4e34\u754c\u3001\u4e34\u754c\u548c\u8d85\u4e34\u754c\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u548c\u5927\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u5bfc\u81f4\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f62\u5206\u89e3\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

We find that further reduction of the latent space via\ndimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with\nmore relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality\nreduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the\nlatent space with different physicochemical properties even at different\npercentages of available labels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e9e\u5927\u800c\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u964d\u7ef4\u3001\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u964d\u7ef4\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u5316\u5b66\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u964d\u7ef4\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u7ec7\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u6297\u83cc\u80bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

However, their zero-shot\nperformance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often\ncompromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical\ndownstream applications.

First, We identify a new\nconnection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose\nthe Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov\npolicy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.\nCADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy\nimprovements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary\nconditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and\nprove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC\nand EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,\nand linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for\nERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.
