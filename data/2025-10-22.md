### [1] [MAT-Agent: Adaptive Multi-Agent Training Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17845)
*Jusheng Zhang,Kaitong Cai,Yijia Fan,Ningyuan Liu,Keze Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAT-Agent是一种多智能体框架，通过动态调整训练参数，优化多标签图像分类任务，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多标签图像分类方法依赖静态配置，难以适应动态复杂的视觉语义场景，需要更灵活的训练策略。

Method: 提出MAT-Agent框架，利用多智能体协作实时优化数据增强、优化器、学习率和损失函数，结合非平稳多臂老虎机算法平衡探索与利用。

Result: 在Pascal VOC、COCO和VG-256数据集上表现优异，mAP分别达到97.4、92.8和60.9，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: MAT-Agent为复杂视觉模型优化提供了可扩展的智能解决方案，推动了自适应深度学习的进步。

Abstract: Multi-label image classification demands adaptive training strategies to
navigate complex, evolving visual-semantic landscapes, yet conventional methods
rely on static configurations that falter in dynamic settings. We propose
MAT-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework that reimagines training as a
collaborative, real-time optimization process. By deploying autonomous agents
to dynamically tune data augmentation, optimizers, learning rates, and loss
functions, MAT-Agent leverages non-stationary multi-armed bandit algorithms to
balance exploration and exploitation, guided by a composite reward harmonizing
accuracy, rare-class performance, and training stability. Enhanced with
dual-rate exponential moving average smoothing and mixed-precision training, it
ensures robustness and efficiency. Extensive experiments across Pascal VOC,
COCO, and VG-256 demonstrate MAT-Agent's superiority: it achieves an mAP of
97.4 (vs. 96.2 for PAT-T), OF1 of 92.3, and CF1 of 91.4 on Pascal VOC; an mAP
of 92.8 (vs. 92.0 for HSQ-CvN), OF1 of 88.2, and CF1 of 87.1 on COCO; and an
mAP of 60.9, OF1 of 70.8, and CF1 of 61.1 on VG-256. With accelerated
convergence and robust cross-domain generalization, MAT-Agent offers a
scalable, intelligent solution for optimizing complex visual models, paving the
way for adaptive deep learning advancements.

### [2] [CoIDO: Efficient Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning via Coupled Importance-Diversity Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17847)
*Yichen Yan,Ming Zhong,Qi Zhu,Xiaoling Gu,Jinpeng Chen,Huan Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoIDO是一种新型的双目标框架，通过联合优化数据重要性和多样性，显著降低了多模态大语言模型指令调优的计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法存在高计算开销和次优选择的问题，需要一种更高效的方法来平衡重要性和多样性。

Method: CoIDO使用轻量级插件评分器，仅需少量随机样本训练，通过同方差不确定性公式平衡重要性和多样性。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B模型上，仅用20%数据选择的子集达到了全数据微调性能的98.2%。

Conclusion: CoIDO提供了一种高效且可扩展的数据选择方法，显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) rely heavily on instruction tuning
to align vision and language capabilities, yet the computational cost of
training on large-scale datasets remains a major bottleneck. Existing data
selection methods aim to mitigate this by selecting important and diverse
subsets, but they often suffer from two critical drawbacks: high computational
overhead from processing the entire dataset and suboptimal data selection due
to separate treatment of importance and diversity.
  We introduce CoIDO, a novel dual-objective framework that jointly optimizes
data importance and diversity to overcome these challenges. Unlike existing
approaches that require costly evaluations across the whole dataset, CoIDO
employs a lightweight plug-in scorer. This scorer is trained on just a small
random sample of data to learn the distribution of the candidate set,
drastically reducing computational demands. By leveraging a homoscedastic
uncertainty-based formulation, CoIDO effectively balances importance and
diversity during training, enabling efficient and scalable data selection.
  In our experiments, we trained the CoIDO scorer using only 20 percent of
randomly sampled data. Once trained, CoIDO was applied to the entire dataset to
select a 20 percent subset for instruction tuning. On the widely used
LLaVA-1.5-7B model across ten downstream tasks, this selected subset achieved
an impressive 98.2 percent of the performance of full-data fine-tuning, on
average.

### [3] [Pre to Post-Treatment Glioblastoma MRI Prediction using a Latent Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17851)
*Alexandre G. Leclercq,Sébastien Bougleux,Noémie N. Moreau,Alexis Desmonts,Romain Hérault,Aurélien Corroyer-Dulmont*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于潜在扩散模型的早期视觉治疗响应预测方法，用于生成治疗后MRI图像，以预测胶质母细胞瘤患者的治疗反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胶质母细胞瘤患者对治疗的反应高度异质，且传统方法需要至少两个月才能观察到治疗效果。早期预测治疗反应对个性化医疗至关重要。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，通过预处理MRI和肿瘤定位信息生成治疗后MRI图像，并结合无分类器引导提升生成质量。

Result: 模型在140名胶质母细胞瘤患者的数据集上进行了训练和测试，数据集包括预处理MRI、治疗后MRI、肿瘤定位和生存信息。

Conclusion: 该方法能够早期预测治疗反应，为个性化医疗提供了潜在工具。

Abstract: Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive primary brain tumor with a median
survival of approximately 15 months. In clinical practice, the Stupp protocol
serves as the standard first-line treatment. However, patients exhibit highly
heterogeneous therapeutic responses which required at least two months before
first visual impact can be observed, typically with MRI. Early prediction
treatment response is crucial for advancing personalized medicine. Disease
Progression Modeling (DPM) aims to capture the trajectory of disease evolution,
while Treatment Response Prediction (TRP) focuses on assessing the impact of
therapeutic interventions. Whereas most TRP approaches primarly rely on
timeseries data, we consider the problem of early visual TRP as a
slice-to-slice translation model generating post-treatment MRI from a
pre-treatment MRI, thus reflecting the tumor evolution. To address this problem
we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with a concatenation-based conditioning
from the pre-treatment MRI and the tumor localization, and a classifier-free
guidance to enhance generation quality using survival information, in
particular post-treatment tumor evolution. Our model were trained and tested on
a local dataset consisting of 140 GBM patients collected at Centre Fran\c{c}ois
Baclesse. For each patient we collected pre and post T1-Gd MRI, tumor
localization manually delineated in the pre-treatment MRI by medical experts,
and survival information.

### [4] [Provenance of AI-Generated Images: A Vector Similarity and Blockchain-based Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17854)
*Jitendra Sharma,Arthur Carvalho,Suman Bhunia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于嵌入的AI图像检测框架，通过图像嵌入和向量相似性区分AI生成与人类创作的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI和大型语言模型的快速发展使得数字内容的真实性验证面临挑战，需要确保数字数据的完整性和来源。

Method: 利用五种基准嵌入模型处理多样化的AI和人类生成图像数据集，通过嵌入相似性进行分类。

Result: 实验表明该方法具有鲁棒性，即使图像经过中度到高度扰动，嵌入特征仍保持相似性。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI生成图像检测提供了通用且高效的方法，平衡了准确性和计算效率。

Abstract: Rapid advancement in generative AI and large language models (LLMs) has
enabled the generation of highly realistic and contextually relevant digital
content. LLMs such as ChatGPT with DALL-E integration and Stable Diffusion
techniques can produce images that are often indistinguishable from those
created by humans, which poses challenges for digital content authentication.
Verifying the integrity and origin of digital data to ensure it remains
unaltered and genuine is crucial to maintaining trust and legality in digital
media. In this paper, we propose an embedding-based AI image detection
framework that utilizes image embeddings and a vector similarity to distinguish
AI-generated images from real (human-created) ones. Our methodology is built on
the hypothesis that AI-generated images demonstrate closer embedding proximity
to other AI-generated content, while human-created images cluster similarly
within their domain. To validate this hypothesis, we developed a system that
processes a diverse dataset of AI and human-generated images through five
benchmark embedding models. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the
robustness of our approach, and our results confirm that moderate to high
perturbations minimally impact the embedding signatures, with perturbed images
maintaining close similarity matches to their original versions. Our solution
provides a generalizable framework for AI-generated image detection that
balances accuracy with computational efficiency.

### [5] [CMIS-Net: A Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual Standardization Network for Backchannel Agreement Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17855)
*Yuxuan Huang,Kangzhong Wang,Eugene Yujun Fu,Grace Ngai,Peter H. F. Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CMIS-Net通过多尺度个体标准化网络解决个体差异和数据不平衡问题，在反馈信号检测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反馈信号（如点头、微笑）在对话中至关重要，但个体差异导致其表达复杂，现有方法难以全面捕捉多尺度行为特征。

Method: 提出CMIS-Net，通过去除个体特定中性基线，提取标准化特征，并结合隐式数据增强模块提升泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明CMIS-Net有效处理个体差异和数据不平衡，在反馈信号检测中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CMIS-Net通过多尺度标准化和数据增强，显著提升反馈信号检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Backchannels are subtle listener responses, such as nods, smiles, or short
verbal cues like "yes" or "uh-huh," which convey understanding and agreement in
conversations. These signals provide feedback to speakers, improve the
smoothness of interaction, and play a crucial role in developing human-like,
responsive AI systems. However, the expression of backchannel behaviors is
often significantly influenced by individual differences, operating across
multiple scales: from instant dynamics such as response intensity (frame-level)
to temporal patterns such as frequency and rhythm preferences (sequence-level).
This presents a complex pattern recognition problem that contemporary emotion
recognition methods have yet to fully address. Particularly, existing
individualized methods in emotion recognition often operate at a single scale,
overlooking the complementary nature of multi-scale behavioral cues. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel Cascaded Multi-Scale Individual
Standardization Network (CMIS-Net) that extracts individual-normalized
backchannel features by removing person-specific neutral baselines from
observed expressions. Operating at both frame and sequence levels, this
normalization allows model to focus on relative changes from each person's
baseline rather than absolute expression values. Furthermore, we introduce an
implicit data augmentation module to address the observed training data
distributional bias, improving model generalization. Comprehensive experiments
and visualizations demonstrate that CMIS-Net effectively handles individual
differences and data imbalance, achieving state-of-the-art performance in
backchannel agreement detection.

### [6] [Shortcutting Pre-trained Flow Matching Diffusion Models is Almost Free Lunch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17858)
*Xu Cai,Yang Wu,Qianli Chen,Haoran Wu,Lichuan Xiang,Hongkai Wen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种超高效的后训练方法，通过新颖的速度场自蒸馏技术，将大规模预训练的流匹配扩散模型转化为高效的多步采样器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要重新训练以适应步长嵌入，成本高昂。本文旨在提供一种更激进的捷径机制，无需步长嵌入。

Method: 利用速度场自蒸馏技术，在线快速学习，无需步长嵌入。

Result: 在3步内训练出高效模型（如Flux），且可集成到预训练阶段，实现高质量多步流。

Conclusion: 该方法首次实现了数十亿参数扩散模型的少样本蒸馏，性能卓越且成本极低。

Abstract: We present an ultra-efficient post-training method for shortcutting
large-scale pre-trained flow matching diffusion models into efficient few-step
samplers, enabled by novel velocity field self-distillation. While shortcutting
in flow matching, originally introduced by shortcut models, offers flexible
trajectory-skipping capabilities, it requires a specialized step-size embedding
incompatible with existing models unless retraining from
scratch$\unicode{x2013}$a process nearly as costly as pretraining itself.
  Our key contribution is thus imparting a more aggressive shortcut mechanism
to standard flow matching models (e.g., Flux), leveraging a unique distillation
principle that obviates the need for step-size embedding. Working on the
velocity field rather than sample space and learning rapidly from self-guided
distillation in an online manner, our approach trains efficiently, e.g.,
producing a 3-step Flux less than one A100 day. Beyond distillation, our method
can be incorporated into the pretraining stage itself, yielding models that
inherently learn efficient, few-step flows without compromising quality. This
capability also enables, to our knowledge, the first few-shot distillation
method (e.g., 10 text-image pairs) for dozen-billion-parameter diffusion
models, delivering state-of-the-art performance at almost free cost.

*Demetrious T. Kutzke,Ying-Kun Wu,Elizabeth Terveen,Junaed Sattar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合计算机视觉和伪IMU数据的混合方法，用于水下环境中潜水员异常行为的监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的水下活动识别方法在复杂环境中效果不佳，尤其是无线信号衰减问题限制了潜水员佩戴传感器与AUV的通信。

Method: 利用计算机视觉从3D人体关节关键点生成高保真运动数据，创建伪IMU数据，避免水下无线信号衰减问题。

Result: 通过AUV集成分类器并在模拟紧急场景中实验，验证了方法的实用性和有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为机器人监测和潜水员安全提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional human activity recognition uses either direct image analysis or
data from wearable inertial measurement units (IMUs), but can be ineffective in
challenging underwater environments. We introduce a novel hybrid approach that
bridges this gap to monitor scuba diver safety. Our method leverages computer
vision to generate high-fidelity motion data, effectively creating a
``pseudo-IMU'' from a stream of 3D human joint keypoints. This technique
circumvents the critical problem of wireless signal attenuation in water, which
plagues conventional diver-worn sensors communicating with an Autonomous
Underwater Vehicle (AUV). We apply this system to the vital task of identifying
anomalous scuba diver behavior that signals the onset of a medical emergency
such as cardiac arrest -- a leading cause of scuba diving fatalities. By
integrating our classifier onboard an AUV and conducting experiments with
simulated distress scenarios, we demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of
our method for advancing robotic monitoring and diver safety.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RGB和X射线成像的融合在医疗诊断、文化遗产修复和制造等领域具有重要价值。

Method: 收集新的配对RGB和X射线数据，进行分层拟合以对齐RGB和X射线辐射高斯泼溅，并提出X射线参考损失以确保一致的内部结构。

Result: InsideOut有效解决了两种模态间数据表示差异和配对数据集有限的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了3D高斯泼溅技术的应用范围，提升了可视化、模拟和无损测试能力。

Abstract: We introduce InsideOut, an extension of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) that
bridges the gap between high-fidelity RGB surface details and subsurface X-ray
structures. The fusion of RGB and X-ray imaging is invaluable in fields such as
medical diagnostics, cultural heritage restoration, and manufacturing. We
collect new paired RGB and X-ray data, perform hierarchical fitting to align
RGB and X-ray radiative Gaussian splats, and propose an X-ray reference loss to
ensure consistent internal structures. InsideOut effectively addresses the
challenges posed by disparate data representations between the two modalities
and limited paired datasets. This approach significantly extends the
applicability of 3DGS, enhancing visualization, simulation, and non-destructive
testing capabilities across various domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决零样本场景下2D目标检测与分割的挑战，提出一种无需训练的高效框架。

Method: 利用3D未见过物体的2D多视角模板和查询图像的2D提案，结合类与块嵌入及广义均值池化，通过联合相似性度量和不确定性感知先验优化匹配。

Result: 在BOP Challenge 2025的多个赛道中排名第一，表现最优。

Conclusion: MUSE为2D目标检测与分割提供了一个强大且通用的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce MUSE (Model-based Uncertainty-aware Similarity
Estimation), a training-free framework designed for model-based zero-shot 2D
object detection and segmentation. MUSE leverages 2D multi-view templates
rendered from 3D unseen objects and 2D object proposals extracted from input
query images. In the embedding stage, it integrates class and patch embeddings,
where the patch embeddings are normalized using generalized mean pooling (GeM)
to capture both global and local representations efficiently. During the
matching stage, MUSE employs a joint similarity metric that combines absolute
and relative similarity scores, enhancing the robustness of matching under
challenging scenarios. Finally, the similarity score is refined through an
uncertainty-aware object prior that adjusts for proposal reliability. Without
any additional training or fine-tuning, MUSE achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the BOP Challenge 2025, ranking first across the Classic Core,
H3, and Industrial tracks. These results demonstrate that MUSE offers a
powerful and generalizable framework for zero-shot 2D object detection and
segmentation.

Motivation: 解决光学音乐识别（OMR）领域因缺乏真实标注数据（尤其是手写历史乐谱）而受限的问题。

Method: 实现音乐符号级GAN生成手写风格符号，并用Smashcima软件组装成完整乐谱。

Result: 生成的符号具有高度视觉真实性，标志着合成乐谱生成的重要进展。

Conclusion: GAN生成的合成乐谱可有效辅助OMR模型的训练。

Abstract: The field of Optical Music Recognition (OMR) is currently hindered by the
scarcity of real annotated data, particularly when dealing with handwritten
historical musical scores. In similar fields, such as Handwritten Text
Recognition, it was proven that synthetic examples produced with image
generation techniques could help to train better-performing recognition
architectures. This study explores the generation of realistic,
handwritten-looking scores by implementing a music symbol-level Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) and assembling its output into a full score using the
Smashcima engraving software. We have systematically evaluated the visual
fidelity of these generated samples, concluding that the generated symbols
exhibit a high degree of realism, marking significant progress in synthetic
score generation.

TL;DR: 论文分析了性别分类系统中的数据不平衡问题，提出了一个平衡数据集BalancedFace，显著减少了分类偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有性别分类数据集存在严重的交叉性代表性不足问题，导致模型在女性和少数族裔面孔上表现不佳。

Method: 通过审计现有数据集，构建了BalancedFace数据集，填补了人口统计空白，并训练标准分类器进行评估。

Result: BalancedFace将种族子群的最大真阳性率差距减少了50%以上，平均差异影响分数接近理想值1.0。

Conclusion: 数据中心的干预对公平性别分类研究具有重要价值，BalancedFace为研究提供了公开资源。

Abstract: Gender classification systems often inherit and amplify demographic
imbalances in their training data. We first audit five widely used gender
classification datasets, revealing that all suffer from significant
intersectional underrepresentation. To measure the downstream impact of these
flaws, we train identical MobileNetV2 classifiers on the two most balanced of
these datasets, UTKFace and FairFace. Our fairness evaluation shows that even
these models exhibit significant bias, misclassifying female faces at a higher
rate than male faces and amplifying existing racial skew. To counter these
data-induced biases, we construct BalancedFace, a new public dataset created by
blending images from FairFace and UTKFace, supplemented with images from other
collections to fill missing demographic gaps. It is engineered to equalize
subgroup shares across 189 intersections of age, race, and gender using only
real, unedited images. When a standard classifier is trained on BalancedFace,
it reduces the maximum True Positive Rate gap across racial subgroups by over
50% and brings the average Disparate Impact score 63% closer to the ideal of
1.0 compared to the next-best dataset, all with a minimal loss of overall
accuracy. These results underline the profound value of data-centric
interventions and provide an openly available resource for fair gender
classification research.

Abstract: 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation (3D WSSS) aims to achieve semantic
segmentation by leveraging sparse or low-cost annotated data, significantly
reducing reliance on dense point-wise annotations. Previous works mainly employ
class activation maps or pre-trained vision-language models to address this
challenge. However, the low quality of pseudo-labels and the insufficient
exploitation of 3D geometric priors jointly create significant technical
bottlenecks in developing high-performance 3D WSSS models. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective 3D weakly supervised semantic segmentation
method that integrates 3D geometric priors into a class-aware guidance
mechanism to generate high-fidelity pseudo labels. Concretely, our designed
methodology first employs Class-Aware Label Refinement module to generate more
balanced and accurate pseudo labels for semantic categrories. This initial
refinement stage focuses on enhancing label quality through category-specific
optimization. Subsequently, the Geometry-Aware Label Refinement component is
developed, which strategically integrates implicit 3D geometric constraints to
effectively filter out low-confidence pseudo labels that fail to comply with
geometric plausibility. Moreover, to address the challenge of extensive
unlabeled regions, we propose a Label Update strategy that integrates
Self-Training to propagate labels into these areas. This iterative process
continuously enhances pseudo-label quality while expanding label coverage,
ultimately fostering the development of high-performance 3D WSSS models.
Comprehensive experimental validation reveals that our proposed methodology
achieves state-of-the-art performance on both ScanNet and S3DIS benchmarks
while demonstrating remarkable generalization capability in unsupervised
settings, maintaining competitive accuracy through its robust design.

TL;DR: 评估三种深度学习分割模型和一种传统方法在MRI图像中分割NAc时的性能差异和公平性，发现种族匹配训练能提高某些模型的准确性，而nnU-Net表现稳健。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究医学图像分割模型在种族和性别等敏感属性上的公平性，避免性能差异。

Method: 使用四种方法（UNesT、nnU-Net、CoTr、ANTs）在包含不同种族和性别的数据集上分割NAc，评估性能和体积差异。

Result: 种族匹配训练提高部分模型准确性；nnU-Net表现稳健；性别效应在手动和偏置模型中一致，种族效应大多消失。

Conclusion: 模型公平性需考虑种族匹配训练，nnU-Net在跨种族表现优异，性别效应更稳定。

Abstract: Deep-learning-based segmentation algorithms have substantially advanced the
field of medical image analysis, particularly in structural delineations in
MRIs. However, an important consideration is the intrinsic bias in the data.
Concerns about unfairness, such as performance disparities based on sensitive
attributes like race and sex, are increasingly urgent. In this work, we
evaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,
and CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the
left and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset
including four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,
and white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train
and test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first
assesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the
volumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their
interaction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to
quantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed
models analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and
derived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to
significantly better segmentation accuracy for some models. ANTs and UNesT show
notable improvements in segmentation accuracy when trained and tested on
race-matched data, unlike nnU-Net, which demonstrates robust performance
independent of demographic matching. Finally, we examine sex and race effects
on the volume of the NAc using segmentations from the manual rater and from our
biased models. Results reveal that the sex effects observed with manual
segmentation can also be observed with biased models, whereas the race effects
disappear in all but one model.

Appreciators (72.8 percent, n=166), Low and Variable Decliners (13.2 percent,
n=30), and Variable Improvers (14.0 percent, n=32), with heterogeneity of
variance (Brown Forsythe p < 0.001); (2) individual level analysis revealed a
positive viewing order effect (mean slope = 0.488, t(227) = 5.42, p < 0.001,
permutation p < 0.001), contradicting fatigue hypotheses; (3) automated humor
classification (77 instances, 131 labels) plus viewer level response modeling
found no type wise differences after FDR correction. The dataset enables
culturally aware emotion AI development and personalized entertainment systems
tailored to non Western contexts.

by processing facial crops and entire video frames through EfficientNetV2 for
spatial feature extraction. These features are then analyzed over time using
two temporal modeling strategies: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and
Transformer encoders. Our model is evaluated on the DAiSEE dataset, a
large-scale benchmark for affective state recognition in e-learning. To enhance
performance on underrepresented engagement classes, we apply targeted data
augmentation techniques. Among the tested variants, ViBED-Net with LSTM
achieves 73.43\% accuracy, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.
ViBED-Net demonstrates that combining face-aware and scene-aware spatiotemporal
cues significantly improves engagement detection accuracy. Its modular design
allows flexibility for application across education, user experience research,
and content personalization. This work advances video-based affective computing
by offering a scalable, high-performing solution for real-world engagement
analysis. The source code for this project is available on

*Roberto Brusnicki,David Pop,Yuan Gao,Mattia Piccinini,Johannes Betz*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAVANT是一个结构化推理框架，通过分层场景分析和两阶段流程，显著提高了自动驾驶系统中异常场景检测的准确性和召回率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在罕见、分布外的语义异常场景中表现脆弱，现有方法依赖昂贵的专有模型且性能不稳定。

Method: 采用分层场景描述提取和多模态评估的两阶段流程，将VLM推理转化为系统化分析。

Result: SAVANT在真实驾驶场景中达到89.6%召回率和88.0%准确率，开源模型Qwen2.5VL表现更优。

Conclusion: SAVANT解决了异常检测中的数据稀缺问题，为自动驾驶系统提供了可靠且低成本的语义监控方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems remain critically vulnerable to the long-tail of
rare, out-of-distribution scenarios with semantic anomalies. While Vision
Language Models (VLMs) offer promising reasoning capabilities, naive prompting
approaches yield unreliable performance and depend on expensive proprietary
models, limiting practical deployment. We introduce SAVANT (Semantic Analysis
with Vision-Augmented Anomaly deTection), a structured reasoning framework that
achieves high accuracy and recall in detecting anomalous driving scenarios from
input images through layered scene analysis and a two-phase pipeline:
structured scene description extraction followed by multi-modal evaluation. Our
approach transforms VLM reasoning from ad-hoc prompting to systematic analysis
across four semantic layers: Street, Infrastructure, Movable Objects, and
Environment. SAVANT achieves 89.6% recall and 88.0% accuracy on real-world
driving scenarios, significantly outperforming unstructured baselines. More
importantly, we demonstrate that our structured framework enables a fine-tuned
7B parameter open-source model (Qwen2.5VL) to achieve 90.8% recall and 93.8%
accuracy - surpassing all models evaluated while enabling local deployment at
near-zero cost. By automatically labeling over 9,640 real-world images with
high accuracy, SAVANT addresses the critical data scarcity problem in anomaly
detection and provides a practical path toward reliable, accessible semantic
monitoring for autonomous systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 红棕榈螨虫害严重影响棕榈种植和经济收益，早期准确识别虫害植物对有效管理至关重要。

Method: 使用TriggerNet框架整合Grad-CAM、RISE、FullGrad和TCAV技术，结合多种深度学习模型（如CNN、EfficientNet等）和机器学习分类器（如随机森林、SVM等），并利用Snorkel进行高效标注。

Result: 研究通过11种植物物种的RGB图像数据集，将植物分为健康、黄斑、红褐色青铜化和丝网四类，实现了高效的虫害分类。

Conclusion: TriggerNet框架在红棕榈螨虫害检测中表现出色，为农业病虫害管理提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: The red palm mite infestation has become a serious concern, particularly in
regions with extensive palm cultivation, leading to reduced productivity and
economic losses. Accurate and early identification of mite-infested plants is
critical for effective management. The current study focuses on evaluating and
comparing the ML model for classifying the affected plants and detecting the
infestation. TriggerNet is a novel interpretable AI framework that integrates
Grad-CAM, RISE, FullGrad, and TCAV to generate novel visual explanations for
deep learning models in plant classification and disease detection. This study
applies TriggerNet to address red palm mite (Raoiella indica) infestation, a
major threat to palm cultivation and agricultural productivity. A diverse set
of RGB images across 11 plant species, Arecanut, Date Palm, Bird of Paradise,
Coconut Palm, Ginger, Citrus Tree, Palm Oil, Orchid, Banana Palm, Avocado Tree,
and Cast Iron Plant was utilized for training and evaluation. Advanced deep
learning models like CNN, EfficientNet, MobileNet, ViT, ResNet50, and
InceptionV3, alongside machine learning classifiers such as Random Forest, SVM,
and KNN, were employed for plant classification. For disease classification,
all plants were categorized into four classes: Healthy, Yellow Spots, Reddish
Bronzing, and Silk Webbing. Snorkel was used to efficiently label these disease
classes by leveraging heuristic rules and patterns, reducing manual annotation
time and improving dataset reliability.

Result: 实验表明，结合3D相机轨迹的文本生成性能优于独立处理方法，并提出了新的联合评估指标。

Conclusion: HouseTour实现了无需专业设备即可生成高质量视频，适用于房地产和旅游应用。

Abstract: We introduce HouseTour, a method for spatially-aware 3D camera trajectory and
natural language summary generation from a collection of images depicting an
existing 3D space. Unlike existing vision-language models (VLMs), which
struggle with geometric reasoning, our approach generates smooth video
trajectories via a diffusion process constrained by known camera poses and
integrates this information into the VLM for 3D-grounded descriptions. We
synthesize the final video using 3D Gaussian splatting to render novel views
along the trajectory. To support this task, we present the HouseTour dataset,
which includes over 1,200 house-tour videos with camera poses, 3D
reconstructions, and real estate descriptions. Experiments demonstrate that
incorporating 3D camera trajectories into the text generation process improves
performance over methods handling each task independently. We evaluate both
individual and end-to-end performance, introducing a new joint metric. Our work
enables automated, professional-quality video creation for real estate and
touristic applications without requiring specialized expertise or equipment.

Motivation: 现有个性化图像生成模型缺乏对多源图像部分组合的显式控制能力。

Method: 构建包含464个语义原子的数据集，训练带有部分条件引导的扩散先验模型，并引入PartEval评估指标。

Result: Chimera在部分对齐和组合准确性上优于基线14%，视觉质量提升21%。

Conclusion: Chimera通过语义原子和条件引导实现了高效的多源图像部分组合生成。

Abstract: Personalized image generative models are highly proficient at synthesizing
images from text or a single image, yet they lack explicit control for
composing objects from specific parts of multiple source images without user
specified masks or annotations. To address this, we introduce Chimera, a
personalized image generation model that generates novel objects by combining
specified parts from different source images according to textual instructions.
To train our model, we first construct a dataset from a taxonomy built on 464
unique (part, subject) pairs, which we term semantic atoms. From this, we
generate 37k prompts and synthesize the corresponding images with a
high-fidelity text-to-image model. We train a custom diffusion prior model with
part-conditional guidance, which steers the image-conditioning features to
enforce both semantic identity and spatial layout. We also introduce an
objective metric PartEval to assess the fidelity and compositional accuracy of
generation pipelines. Human evaluations and our proposed metric show that
Chimera outperforms other baselines by 14% in part alignment and compositional
accuracy and 21% in visual quality.

Motivation: 微塑料（MPs）污染普遍且对生态和人类健康有潜在影响，但传统检测方法效率低，机器学习有望提升检测效率。

Method: 研究结合SEM成像和机器学习（YOLO模型）检测微塑料，聚焦于背景对称的过滤场景，并优化预处理步骤。

Result: 研究发现YOLO模型在任务中表现差异显著，预处理优化是关键，但专家标注数据不足限制了模型可靠性。

Conclusion: 机器学习在微塑料检测中潜力巨大，但需解决数据标注和预处理优化等挑战。

Abstract: Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous pollutants with demonstrated potential to
impact ecosystems and human health. Their microscopic size complicates
detection, classification, and removal, especially in biological and
environmental samples. While techniques like optical microscopy, Scanning
Electron Microscopy (SEM), and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) provide a sound
basis for detection, applying these approaches requires usually manual analysis
and prevents efficient use in large screening studies. To this end, machine
learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool in advancing microplastic
detection. In this exploratory study, we investigate potential, limitations and
future directions of advancing the detection and quantification of MP particles
and fibres using a combination of SEM imaging and machine learning-based object
detection. For simplicity, we focus on a filtration scenario where image
backgrounds exhibit a symmetric and repetitive pattern. Our findings indicate
differences in the quality of YOLO models for the given task and the relevance
of optimizing preprocessing. At the same time, we identify open challenges,
such as limited amounts of expert-labeled data necessary for reliable training
of ML models.

Motivation: 传统ViT对高分辨率图像处理效率低，APT旨在通过动态调整块大小来优化计算效率。

Method: APT在图像不同区域使用不同大小的块，复杂区域用小块，简单区域用大块。

Result: APT在ViT-L和ViT-H上分别提升40%和50%的吞吐量，训练和推理时间减少30%。

Conclusion: APT是一种高效且兼容现有ViT的改进方法，显著提升速度而不牺牲性能。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) partition input images into uniformly sized
patches regardless of their content, resulting in long input sequence lengths
for high-resolution images. We present Adaptive Patch Transformers (APT), which
addresses this by using multiple different patch sizes within the same image.
APT reduces the total number of input tokens by allocating larger patch sizes
in more homogeneous areas and smaller patches in more complex ones. APT
achieves a drastic speedup in ViT inference and training, increasing throughput
by 40% on ViT-L and 50% on ViT-H while maintaining downstream performance, and
can be applied to a previously fine-tuned ViT, converging in as little as 1
epoch. It also significantly reduces training and inference time without loss
of performance in high-resolution dense visual tasks, achieving up to 30\%
faster training and inference in visual QA, object detection, and semantic
segmentation.

Conclusion: 3DGS在表面重建、动画和内容生成中具有潜力，但需进一步优化。

Abstract: The problem of 3D reconstruction from posed images is undergoing a
fundamental transformation, driven by continuous advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). By modeling scenes explicitly as collections of 3D Gaussians,
3DGS enables efficient rasterization through volumetric splatting, offering
thus a seamless integration with common graphics pipelines. Despite its
real-time rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis, 3DGS suffers from a
high memory footprint, the tendency to bake lighting effects directly into its
representation, and limited support for secondary-ray effects. This tutorial
provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of the 3DGS pipeline, starting
from its splatting formulation and then exploring the main efforts in
addressing its limitations. Finally, we survey a range of applications that
leverage 3DGS for surface reconstruction, avatar modeling, animation, and
content generation-highlighting its efficient rendering and suitability for
feed-forward pipelines.

Motivation: 解决低资源、预算受限环境下视觉语言模型的适应性问题，避免大规模模型的不实用性和小规模模型的高成本微调需求。

Method: 基于上下文学习框架，提出ICD方法，包括跨模态演示选择策略、教师测试时缩放和学生不确定性条件化等技术。

Result: 小模型性能显著提升（最高33%），仅需少量教师标注（低至4%），并接近教师模型的零样本性能。

Conclusion: ICD方法在低资源环境下高效且实用，为小规模模型性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: As the field continues its push for ever more resources, this work turns the
spotlight on a critical question: how can vision-language models (VLMs) be
adapted to thrive in low-resource, budget-constrained settings? While large
VLMs offer strong performance, they are impractical to deploy in such settings.
Small VLMs, on the other hand, are efficient but typically require costly
fine-tuning to close the performance gap with larger models in the deployment
domain. Inspired by the in-context learning framework, we propose an online
In-Context Distillation (ICD) method, in which a small VLM collaborates with a
stronger teacher model at inference time, distilling its knowledge via sparse
demonstrations to efficiently bridge the gap between them. Our method is built
on an in-depth analysis that identifies the scale and the choice of models for
which vision-language ICL is currently feasible, and demonstrates the advantage
of ICL over fine-tuning under constrained compute budgets. We enhance our
method with a novel cross-modal demonstration selection strategy, teacher
test-time scaling to reduce noise, and student uncertainty conditioning to
dynamically populate a demonstration pool and minimize teacher queries. Our ICD
method significantly boosts the performance of small models (up to 33%) using
scarce teacher annotations (as low as 4%), and competes with the teacher's
zero-shot performance.

Conclusion: 该研究为语言驱动的交通协作系统提供了安全可信的研究方向。

Abstract: Collaborative driving systems leverage vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
communication across multiple agents to enhance driving safety and efficiency.
Traditional V2X systems take raw sensor data, neural features, or perception
results as communication media, which face persistent challenges, including
high bandwidth demands, semantic loss, and interoperability issues. Recent
advances investigate natural language as a promising medium, which can provide
semantic richness, decision-level reasoning, and human-machine interoperability
at significantly lower bandwidth. Despite great promise, this paradigm shift
also introduces new vulnerabilities within language communication, including
message loss, hallucinations, semantic manipulation, and adversarial attacks.
In this work, we present the first systematic study of full-stack safety and
security issues in natural-language-based collaborative driving. Specifically,
we develop a comprehensive taxonomy of attack strategies, including connection
disruption, relay/replay interference, content spoofing, and multi-connection
forgery. To mitigate these risks, we introduce an agentic defense pipeline,
which we call SafeCoop, that integrates a semantic firewall,
language-perception consistency checks, and multi-source consensus, enabled by
an agentic transformation function for cross-frame spatial alignment. We
systematically evaluate SafeCoop in closed-loop CARLA simulation across 32
critical scenarios, achieving 69.15% driving score improvement under malicious
attacks and up to 67.32% F1 score for malicious detection. This study provides
guidance for advancing research on safe, secure, and trustworthy
language-driven collaboration in transportation systems. Our project page is

Motivation: 现有评估方法过于碎片化，关注视觉质量而忽视具身任务的实用性，因此需要一种闭环评估平台。

Method: 引入World-in-World平台，提供统一规划策略和标准化API，在四个闭环环境中评估WMs，并研究数据扩展规律。

Result: 发现视觉质量不保证任务成功，可控性更重要；数据扩展比升级视频生成器更有效；增加推理计算可显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 闭环评估揭示了WMs在具身任务中的实际效用，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) can now simulate worlds with striking visual
realism, which naturally raises the question of whether they can endow embodied
agents with predictive perception for decision making. Progress on this
question has been limited by fragmented evaluation: most existing benchmarks
adopt open-loop protocols that emphasize visual quality in isolation, leaving
the core issue of embodied utility unresolved, i.e., do WMs actually help
agents succeed at embodied tasks? To address this gap, we introduce
World-in-World, the first open platform that benchmarks WMs in a closed-loop
world that mirrors real agent-environment interactions. World-in-World provides
a unified online planning strategy and a standardized action API, enabling
heterogeneous WMs for decision making. We curate four closed-loop environments
that rigorously evaluate diverse WMs, prioritize task success as the primary
metric, and move beyond the common focus on visual quality; we also present the
first data scaling law for world models in embodied settings. Our study
uncovers three surprises: (1) visual quality alone does not guarantee task
success, controllability matters more; (2) scaling post-training with
action-observation data is more effective than upgrading the pretrained video
generators; and (3) allocating more inference-time compute allows WMs to
substantially improve closed-loop performance.

Result: 在合成和真实月球数据上验证了方法的有效性，显著优于零样本基线。

Conclusion: LunarStereo和MASt3R为地外环境中的跨尺度泛化提供了新途径。

Abstract: Accurate 3D reconstruction of lunar surfaces is essential for space
exploration. However, existing stereo vision reconstruction methods struggle in
this context due to the Moon's lack of texture, difficult lighting variations,
and atypical orbital trajectories. State-of-the-art deep learning models,
trained on human-scale datasets, have rarely been tested on planetary imagery
and cannot be transferred directly to lunar conditions. To address this issue,
we introduce LunarStereo, the first open dataset of photorealistic stereo image
pairs of the Moon, simulated using ray tracing based on high-resolution
topography and reflectance models. It covers diverse altitudes, lighting
conditions, and viewing angles around the lunar South Pole, offering physically
grounded supervision for 3D reconstruction tasks. Based on this dataset, we
adapt the MASt3R model to the lunar domain through fine-tuning on LunarStereo.
We validate our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative
experiments on both synthetic and real lunar data, evaluating 3D surface
reconstruction and relative pose estimation. Extensive experiments on synthetic
and real lunar data validate the approach, demonstrating significant
improvements over zero-shot baselines and paving the way for robust cross-scale
generalization in extraterrestrial environments.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in crowded scenes is challenging due to severe
inter-person occlusions and highly dynamic, context-dependent motion patterns.
Existing approaches often struggle to adapt to varying crowd densities and lack
interpretable anomaly indicators. To address these limitations, we introduce
VelocityNet, a dual-pipeline framework that combines head detection and dense
optical flow to extract person-specific velocities. Hierarchical clustering
categorizes these velocities into semantic motion classes (halt, slow, normal,
and fast), and a percentile-based anomaly scoring system measures deviations
from learned normal patterns. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our
framework in real-time detection of diverse anomalous motion patterns within
densely crowded environments.

Result: RadDiagSeg-M在多目标文本和掩码生成任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RadDiagSeg-M为辅助诊断提供了丰富的上下文信息，建立了强基线。

Abstract: Most current medical vision language models struggle to jointly generate
diagnostic text and pixel-level segmentation masks in response to complex
visual questions. This represents a major limitation towards clinical
application, as assistive systems that fail to provide both modalities
simultaneously offer limited value to medical practitioners. To alleviate this
limitation, we first introduce RadDiagSeg-D, a dataset combining abnormality
detection, diagnosis, and multi-target segmentation into a unified and
hierarchical task. RadDiagSeg-D covers multiple imaging modalities and is
precisely designed to support the development of models that produce
descriptive text and corresponding segmentation masks in tandem. Subsequently,
we leverage the dataset to propose a novel vision-language model, RadDiagSeg-M,
capable of joint abnormality detection, diagnosis, and flexible segmentation.
RadDiagSeg-M provides highly informative and clinically useful outputs,
effectively addressing the need to enrich contextual information for assistive
diagnosis. Finally, we benchmark RadDiagSeg-M and showcase its strong
performance across all components involved in the task of multi-target
text-and-mask generation, establishing a robust and competitive baseline.

Motivation: 解决SAM-2在超声视频中因帧独立设计导致的不稳定预测和时间漂移问题，满足介入性超声对稳定性和实时性的高要求。

Method: 在SAM-2基础上加入置信度加权的指数移动平均指针，生成稳定的肿瘤潜在原型，保持时间一致性。

Result: 在PTMC-RFA数据集上，EMA-SAM将maxDice从0.82提升至0.86，maxIoU从0.72提升至0.76，假阳性减少29%。在外部基准测试中，Dice分数提升2-5点。

Conclusion: EMA-SAM是一种高效且鲁棒的框架，填补了基础模型与介入性超声严格需求之间的差距，同时保持实时性能。

Abstract: Papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) is increasingly managed with
radio-frequency ablation (RFA), yet accurate lesion segmentation in ultrasound
videos remains difficult due to low contrast, probe-induced motion, and
heat-related artifacts. The recent Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM-2) generalizes
well to static images, but its frame-independent design yields unstable
predictions and temporal drift in interventional ultrasound. We introduce
\textbf{EMA-SAM}, a lightweight extension of SAM-2 that incorporates a
confidence-weighted exponential moving average pointer into the memory bank,
providing a stable latent prototype of the tumour across frames. This design
preserves temporal coherence through probe pressure and bubble occlusion while
rapidly adapting once clear evidence reappears. On our curated PTMC-RFA dataset
(124 minutes, 13 patients), EMA-SAM improves \emph{maxDice} from 0.82 (SAM-2)
to 0.86 and \emph{maxIoU} from 0.72 to 0.76, while reducing false positives by
29\%. On external benchmarks, including VTUS and colonoscopy video polyp
datasets, EMA-SAM achieves consistent gains of 2--5 Dice points over SAM-2.
Importantly, the EMA pointer adds \textless0.1\% FLOPs, preserving real-time
throughput of $\sim$30\,FPS on a single A100 GPU. These results establish
EMA-SAM as a robust and efficient framework for stable tumour tracking,
bridging the gap between foundation models and the stringent demands of
interventional ultrasound. Codes are available here \hyperref[code

Result: 模型在单模态准确率90%+，但联合推理降至20-55%，34%错误源于组合推理缺失。指令调整可减少边缘内容过度屏蔽（62.4%→10.4%），但牺牲安全性（拒绝率90.8%→53.9%）。

Conclusion: VLSU暴露模型联合理解弱点，为鲁棒视觉-语言安全研究提供关键测试基准。

Abstract: Safety evaluation of multimodal foundation models often treats vision and
language inputs separately, missing risks from joint interpretation where
benign content becomes harmful in combination. Existing approaches also fail to
distinguish clearly unsafe content from borderline cases, leading to
problematic over-blocking or under-refusal of genuinely harmful content. We
present Vision Language Safety Understanding (VLSU), a comprehensive framework
to systematically evaluate multimodal safety through fine-grained severity
classification and combinatorial analysis across 17 distinct safety patterns.
Using a multi-stage pipeline with real-world images and human annotation, we
construct a large-scale benchmark of 8,187 samples spanning 15 harm categories.
Our evaluation of eleven state-of-the-art models reveals systematic joint
understanding failures: while models achieve 90%-plus accuracy on clear
unimodal safety signals, performance degrades substantially to 20-55% when
joint image-text reasoning is required to determine the safety label. Most
critically, 34% of errors in joint image-text safety classification occur
despite correct classification of the individual modalities, further
demonstrating absent compositional reasoning capabilities. Additionally, we
find that models struggle to balance refusing unsafe content while still
responding to borderline cases that deserve engagement. For example, we find
that instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline
content from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of
under-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to
53.9%. Overall, our framework exposes weaknesses in joint image-text
understanding and alignment gaps in current models, and provides a critical
test bed to enable the next milestones in research on robust vision-language
safety.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于生成的去偏框架，通过表示分数（RS）诊断表示差距，并利用视觉蓝图和生成对齐策略提升合成质量，显著改善了罕见类别的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去偏方法受限于样本表示多样性，而简单生成增强可能保留原有偏差。此外，罕见类别的数据生成存在实例频率不完整和合成质量不足的问题。

Method: 引入表示分数（RS）诊断表示差距，使用视觉蓝图替代模糊文本提示，并采用生成对齐策略提升合成质量。

Result: 显著缩小了罕见类别的性能差距，如大/罕见实例的mAP分别提升4.4/3.6，布局准确性超越现有L2I模型15.9 mAP。

Conclusion: 通过RS和生成对齐策略，有效解决了去偏问题，提升了复杂场景下的检测性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object
detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation
diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the
biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating
more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance
frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii)
current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate
high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation
score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the
creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace
ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative
alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and
generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for
underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6
mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP
for layout accuracy in generated images.

Motivation: 探索长上下文压缩的可行性，并提升OCR精度，适用于历史文档压缩和LLM记忆机制研究。

Method: 采用DeepEncoder作为核心引擎，保持低激活和高压缩比，结合解码器实现高效OCR。

Result: 在OmniDocBench上超越现有方法，仅用100视觉token超越GOT-OCR2.0，800token超越MinerU2.0。

Conclusion: DeepSeek-OCR在长上下文压缩和OCR任务中表现优异，具有高实用价值和研究潜力。

Abstract: We present DeepSeek-OCR as an initial investigation into the feasibility of
compressing long contexts via optical 2D mapping. DeepSeek-OCR consists of two
components: DeepEncoder and DeepSeek3B-MoE-A570M as the decoder. Specifically,
DeepEncoder serves as the core engine, designed to maintain low activations
under high-resolution input while achieving high compression ratios to ensure
an optimal and manageable number of vision tokens. Experiments show that when
the number of text tokens is within 10 times that of vision tokens (i.e., a
compression ratio < 10x), the model can achieve decoding (OCR) precision of
97%. Even at a compression ratio of 20x, the OCR accuracy still remains at
about 60%. This shows considerable promise for research areas such as
historical long-context compression and memory forgetting mechanisms in LLMs.
Beyond this, DeepSeek-OCR also demonstrates high practical value. On
OmniDocBench, it surpasses GOT-OCR2.0 (256 tokens/page) using only 100 vision
tokens, and outperforms MinerU2.0 (6000+ tokens per page on average) while
utilizing fewer than 800 vision tokens. In production, DeepSeek-OCR can
generate training data for LLMs/VLMs at a scale of 200k+ pages per day (a
single A100-40G). Codes and model weights are publicly accessible at

Result: 在nuScenes和TruckScenes等数据集上实现了最先进的性能，零样本准确率提升了27%。

Conclusion: 有效的领域适应而非大规模真实标注是实现鲁棒开放词汇3D感知的关键。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D object classification is crucial for real-world applications
like autonomous driving, however it is often hindered by a significant domain
gap between the synthetic data used for training and the sparse, noisy LiDAR
scans encountered in the real-world. Current methods trained solely on
synthetic data fail to generalize to outdoor scenes, while those trained only
on real data lack the semantic diversity to recognize rare or unseen objects.
  We introduce BlendCLIP, a multimodal pretraining framework that bridges this
synthetic-to-real gap by strategically combining the strengths of both domains.
We first propose a pipeline to generate a large-scale dataset of object-level
triplets -- consisting of a point cloud, image, and text description -- mined
directly from real-world driving data and human annotated 3D boxes. Our core
contribution is a curriculum-based data mixing strategy that first grounds the
model in the semantically rich synthetic CAD data before progressively adapting
it to the specific characteristics of real-world scans.
  Our experiments show that our approach is highly label-efficient: introducing
as few as 1.5\% real-world samples per batch into training boosts zero-shot
accuracy on the nuScenes benchmark by 27\%. Consequently, our final model
achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging outdoor datasets like
nuScenes and TruckScenes, improving over the best prior method by 19.3\% on
nuScenes, while maintaining strong generalization on diverse synthetic
benchmarks. Our findings demonstrate that effective domain adaptation, not
full-scale real-world annotation, is the key to unlocking robust
open-vocabulary 3D perception. Our code and dataset will be released upon
acceptance on https://github.com/kesu1/BlendCLIP.

Abstract: Understanding 3D scenes is pivotal for autonomous driving, robotics, and
augmented reality. Recent semantic Gaussian Splatting approaches leverage
large-scale 2D vision models to project 2D semantic features onto 3D scenes.
However, they suffer from two major limitations: (1) insufficient contextual
cues for individual masks during preprocessing and (2) inconsistencies and
missing details when fusing multi-view features from these 2D models. In this
paper, we introduce \textbf{OpenInsGaussian}, an \textbf{Open}-vocabulary
\textbf{Ins}tance \textbf{Gaussian} segmentation framework with Context-aware
Cross-view Fusion. Our method consists of two modules: Context-Aware Feature
Extraction, which augments each mask with rich semantic context, and
Attention-Driven Feature Aggregation, which selectively fuses multi-view
features to mitigate alignment errors and incompleteness. Through extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets, OpenInsGaussian achieves state-of-the-art
results in open-vocabulary 3D Gaussian segmentation, outperforming existing
baselines by a large margin. These findings underscore the robustness and
generality of our proposed approach, marking a significant step forward in 3D
scene understanding and its practical deployment across diverse real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: Neural network compression has gained increasing attention in recent years,
particularly in computer vision applications, where the need for model
reduction is crucial for overcoming deployment constraints. Pruning is a widely
used technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,
neurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is
especially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which
further accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can
be computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.
To overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which
applies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a
considerable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by
proposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep
learning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages
cause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a
progressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the
network, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of
the model. Then, through experiments conducted on convolution neural network
and vision transformer baselines, pre-trained on classification tasks, we
demonstrate that our method consistently achieves substantial reductions in
model size, with minimal impact on performance, and without the need for
fine-tuning. Overall, our approach outperforms its counterparts, offering the
best trade-off. Our code is available on GitHub.

Conclusion: 通过双曲空间学习和时间运动先验的结合，实现了更准确和流畅的人体网格重建。

Abstract: 3D human meshes show a natural hierarchical structure (like
torso-limbs-fingers). But existing video-based 3D human mesh recovery methods
usually learn mesh features in Euclidean space. It's hard to catch this
hierarchical structure accurately. So wrong human meshes are reconstructed. To
solve this problem, we propose a hyperbolic space learning method leveraging
temporal motion prior for recovering 3D human meshes from videos. First, we
design a temporal motion prior extraction module. This module extracts the
temporal motion features from the input 3D pose sequences and image feature
sequences respectively. Then it combines them into the temporal motion prior.
In this way, it can strengthen the ability to express features in the temporal
motion dimension. Since data representation in non-Euclidean space has been
proved to effectively capture hierarchical relationships in real-world datasets
(especially in hyperbolic space), we further design a hyperbolic space
optimization learning strategy. This strategy uses the temporal motion prior
information to assist learning, and uses 3D pose and pose motion information
respectively in the hyperbolic space to optimize and learn the mesh features.
Then, we combine the optimized results to get an accurate and smooth human
mesh. Besides, to make the optimization learning process of human meshes in
hyperbolic space stable and effective, we propose a hyperbolic mesh
optimization loss. Extensive experimental results on large publicly available
datasets indicate superiority in comparison with most state-of-the-art.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在自然场景理解中表现优异，但在水下环境中的应用尚未充分探索。水下图像具有独特挑战，如光线衰减、颜色失真和悬浮颗粒散射，且需要专业知识。

Method: 通过构建UWBench数据集，包含多样化的水下图像和标注（如对象描述和问答对），并基于此建立了三个基准任务：详细图像描述、视觉定位和视觉问答。

Conclusion: UWBench为水下视觉语言研究提供了重要资源，支持海洋科学和自主水下探索等应用。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in
natural scene understanding, yet their application to underwater environments
remains largely unexplored. Underwater imagery presents unique challenges
including severe light attenuation, color distortion, and suspended particle
scattering, while requiring specialized knowledge of marine ecosystems and
organism taxonomy. To bridge this gap, we introduce UWBench, a comprehensive
benchmark specifically designed for underwater vision-language understanding.
UWBench comprises 15,003 high-resolution underwater images captured across
diverse aquatic environments, encompassing oceans, coral reefs, and deep-sea
habitats. Each image is enriched with human-verified annotations including
15,281 object referring expressions that precisely describe marine organisms
and underwater structures, and 124,983 question-answer pairs covering diverse
reasoning capabilities from object recognition to ecological relationship
understanding. The dataset captures rich variations in visibility, lighting
conditions, and water turbidity, providing a realistic testbed for model
evaluation. Based on UWBench, we establish three comprehensive benchmarks:
detailed image captioning for generating ecologically informed scene
descriptions, visual grounding for precise localization of marine organisms,
and visual question answering for multimodal reasoning about underwater
environments. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art VLMs demonstrate that
underwater understanding remains challenging, with substantial room for
improvement. Our benchmark provides essential resources for advancing
vision-language research in underwater contexts and supporting applications in
marine science, ecological monitoring, and autonomous underwater exploration.

Result: 在大规模公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法在重建精度和计算效率上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过潜在信息挖掘和低维学习，显著提升了3D人体网格恢复的性能和效率。

Abstract: Existing 3D human mesh recovery methods often fail to fully exploit the
latent information (e.g., human motion, shape alignment), leading to issues
with limb misalignment and insufficient local details in the reconstructed
human mesh (especially in complex scenes). Furthermore, the performance
improvement gained by modelling mesh vertices and pose node interactions using
attention mechanisms comes at a high computational cost. To address these
issues, we propose a two-stage network for human mesh recovery based on latent
information and low dimensional learning. Specifically, the first stage of the
network fully excavates global (e.g., the overall shape alignment) and local
(e.g., textures, detail) information from the low and high-frequency components
of image features and aggregates this information into a hybrid latent
frequency domain feature. This strategy effectively extracts latent
information. Subsequently, utilizing extracted hybrid latent frequency domain
features collaborates to enhance 2D poses to 3D learning. In the second stage,
with the assistance of hybrid latent features, we model the interaction
learning between the rough 3D human mesh template and the 3D pose, optimizing
the pose and shape of the human mesh. Unlike existing mesh pose interaction
methods, we design a low-dimensional mesh pose interaction method through
dimensionality reduction and parallel optimization that significantly reduces
computational costs without sacrificing reconstruction accuracy. Extensive
experimental results on large publicly available datasets indicate superiority
compared to the most state-of-the-art.

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实验表明，方法优于现有域泛化方法，跨域性能更平衡。

Conclusion: TreeFedDG有效抑制全局漂移，提升医学图像分割的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: In medical image segmentation tasks, Domain Generalization (DG) under the
Federated Learning (FL) framework is crucial for addressing challenges related
to privacy protection and data heterogeneity. However, traditional federated
learning methods fail to account for the imbalance in information aggregation
across clients in cross-domain scenarios, leading to the Global Drift (GD)
problem and a consequent decline in model generalization performance. This
motivates us to delve deeper and define a new critical issue: global drift in
federated domain generalization for medical imaging (FedDG-GD). In this paper,
we propose a novel tree topology framework called TreeFedDG. First, starting
from the distributed characteristics of medical images, we design a
hierarchical parameter aggregation method based on a tree-structured topology
to suppress deviations in the global model direction. Second, we introduce a
parameter difference-based style mixing method (FedStyle), which enforces
mixing among clients with maximum parameter differences to enhance robustness
against drift. Third, we develop a a progressive personalized fusion strategy
during model distribution, ensuring a balance between knowledge transfer and
personalized features. Finally, during the inference phase, we use feature
similarity to guide the retrieval of the most relevant model chain from the
tree structure for ensemble decision-making, thereby fully leveraging the
advantages of hierarchical knowledge. We conducted extensive experiments on two
publicly available datasets. The results demonstrate that our method
outperforms other state-of-the-art domain generalization approaches in these
challenging tasks and achieves better balance in cross-domain performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式视频视觉语言模型面临因果性和累积性约束，现有方法仅解决后LLM阶段的瓶颈，而忽略了前LLM阶段的成本问题。

Method: StreamingTOM通过因果时间缩减和在线量化内存两阶段方法，分别减少前LLM阶段的预填充成本和后LLM阶段的kv-cache内存占用。

Result: 实验显示，StreamingTOM实现了15.7倍的kv-cache压缩，1.2倍更低的内存峰值和2倍更快的TTFT，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: StreamingTOM的两阶段方法为高效流式视频理解提供了实际优势，解决了内存和延迟问题。

Abstract: Unlike offline processing, streaming video vision-language models face two
fundamental constraints: causality and accumulation. Causality prevents access
to future frames that offline methods exploit, while accumulation causes tokens
to grow unbounded, creating efficiency bottlenecks. However, existing
approaches only regulate post-LLM kv-cache, leaving costly pre-LLM prefill
unchanged. We introduce StreamingTOM, a training-free, plug-and-play two-stage
framework that addresses both pre-LLM and post-LLM bottlenecks with predictable
latency. Causal Temporal Reduction imposes a fixed per-frame budget and selects
tokens based on adjacent-frame changes and token saliency, drastically reducing
per-frame prefill cost by processing only a compact subset of visual tokens per
frame instead of all visual tokens. Online Quantized Memory stores tokens in
4-bit format, retrieves relevant groups on demand, and dequantizes them,
keeping the active kv-cache bounded regardless of stream length. Experiments
demonstrate our method achieves $15.7\times$ kv-cache compression, $1.2\times$
lower peak memory and $2\times$ faster TTFT compared to prior SOTA.
StreamingTOM maintains state-of-the-art accuracy among training-free methods
with an average of $63.8\%$ on offline benchmarks and $55.8\%/3.7$ on RVS.
These results highlight the practical benefits of our two-stage approach for
efficient streaming video understanding with bounded growth.

Abstract: Identity preserving editing of faces is a generative task that enables
modifying the illumination, adding/removing eyeglasses, face aging, editing
hairstyles, modifying expression etc., while preserving the identity of the
face. Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic
editing of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in
GANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of
attributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view
consistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face. Further, 3D
portrait editing requires large-scale attribute labelled datasets and presents
a trade-off between editability in low-resolution and inflexibility to editing
in high resolution. In this work, we aim to alleviate some of the constraints
in editing 3D faces by identifying latent space directions that correspond to
photorealistic edits. To address this, we present a method that builds on
recent advancements in 3D-aware deep generative models and 2D portrait editing
techniques to perform efficient few-shot identity preserving attribute editing
for 3D-aware generative models. We aim to show from experimental results that
using just ten or fewer labelled images of an attribute is sufficient to
estimate edit directions in the latent space that correspond to 3D-aware
attribute editing. In this work, we leverage an existing face dataset with
masks to obtain the synthetic images for few attribute examples required for
estimating the edit directions. Further, to demonstrate the linearity of edits,
we investigate one-shot stylization by performing sequential editing and use
the (2D) Attribute Style Manipulation (ASM) technique to investigate a
continuous style manifold for 3D consistent identity preserving face aging.

Conclusion: 该方法在多种环境下表现优越，无需额外训练，适用于现有框架。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for metric depth estimation that enhances
pretrained diffusion-based monocular depth estimation (DB-MDE) models with
stereo vision guidance. While existing DB-MDE methods excel at predicting
relative depth, estimating absolute metric depth remains challenging due to
scale ambiguities in single-image scenarios. To address this, we reframe depth
estimation as an inverse problem, leveraging pretrained latent diffusion models
(LDMs) conditioned on RGB images, combined with stereo-based geometric
constraints, to learn scale and shift for accurate depth recovery. Our
training-free solution seamlessly integrates into existing DB-MDE frameworks
and generalizes across indoor, outdoor, and complex environments. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach matches or surpasses state-of-the-art
methods, particularly in challenging scenarios involving translucent and
specular surfaces, all without requiring retraining.

Conclusion: Med-RwR通过整合外部知识有效提升了推理能力，并展示了在陌生领域的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Incentivizing the reasoning ability of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) is essential for medical applications to transparently analyze medical
scans and provide reliable diagnosis. However, existing medical MLLMs rely
solely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated
reasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their
training scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
methods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during
reasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual
information during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first
Multimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively
retrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific
medical concepts during reasoning. Specifically, we design a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy with tailored rewards that stimulate the model
to leverage both visual diagnostic findings and textual clinical information
for effective retrieval. Building on this foundation, we further propose a
Confidence-Driven Image Re-retrieval (CDIR) method for test-time scaling when
low prediction confidence is detected. Evaluation on various public medical
benchmarks demonstrates Med-RwR's significant improvements over baseline
models, proving the effectiveness of enhancing reasoning capabilities with
external knowledge integration. Furthermore, Med-RwR demonstrates remarkable
generalizability to unfamiliar domains, evidenced by 8.8% performance gain on
our proposed EchoCardiography Benchmark (ECBench), despite the scarcity of
echocardiography data in the training corpus. Our data, model, and codes will

TL;DR: 研究探讨了图像分辨率对多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在生物医学应用中的性能影响，并提出了优化建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs多针对低分辨率通用数据集设计，可能导致生物医学高分辨率图像的关键信息丢失。

Method: 通过实验验证原生分辨率训练与推理、分辨率不匹配的影响，以及混合分辨率训练的效果。

Result: 原生分辨率显著提升性能，分辨率不匹配会严重降低性能，混合分辨率训练能有效平衡计算与性能。

Conclusion: 建议优先采用原生分辨率推理和混合分辨率数据集，以优化生物医学MLLMs的性能。

Abstract: Imaging technologies are fundamental to biomedical research and modern
medicine, requiring analysis of high-resolution images across various
modalities. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise for
biomedical image analysis, most are designed for low-resolution images from
general-purpose datasets, risking critical information loss. We investigate how
image resolution affects MLLM performance in biomedical applications and
demonstrate that: (1) native-resolution training and inference significantly
improve performance across multiple tasks, (2) misalignment between training
and inference resolutions severely degrades performance, and (3)
mixed-resolution training effectively mitigates misalignment and balances
computational constraints with performance requirements. Based on these
findings, we recommend prioritizing native-resolution inference and
mixed-resolution datasets to optimize biomedical MLLMs for transformative
impact in scientific research and clinical applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在状态模态、视频序列长度、动作控制和奖励意识方面存在不足。

Method: OmniNWM通过联合生成全景视频（RGB、语义、深度、3D占用）和引入Plucker射线图表示，实现了高质量的长时域生成和精确控制。

Result: 实验表明，OmniNWM在视频生成、控制精度和长时域稳定性方面达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: OmniNWM提供了一个统一的框架，解决了自动驾驶世界模型的核心挑战。

Abstract: Autonomous driving world models are expected to work effectively across three
core dimensions: state, action, and reward. Existing models, however, are
typically restricted to limited state modalities, short video sequences,
imprecise action control, and a lack of reward awareness. In this paper, we
introduce OmniNWM, an omniscient panoramic navigation world model that
addresses all three dimensions within a unified framework. For state, OmniNWM
jointly generates panoramic videos of RGB, semantics, metric depth, and 3D
occupancy. A flexible forcing strategy enables high-quality long-horizon
auto-regressive generation. For action, we introduce a normalized panoramic
Plucker ray-map representation that encodes input trajectories into pixel-level
signals, enabling highly precise and generalizable control over panoramic video
generation. Regarding reward, we move beyond learning reward functions with
external image-based models: instead, we leverage the generated 3D occupancy to
directly define rule-based dense rewards for driving compliance and safety.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniNWM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in video generation, control accuracy, and long-horizon stability,
while providing a reliable closed-loop evaluation framework through
occupancy-grounded rewards. Project page is available at

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但仍存在对象幻觉问题。现有方法在可扩展性、适应性和模型独立性方面存在不足。

Method: 提出ATED框架，通过动态计算基于不确定性的权重，整合多个模型的预测路径，以提升上下文基础和语义一致性。

Result: 在标准幻觉检测基准上，ATED显著优于现有方法，减少幻觉同时保持流畅性和相关性。

Conclusion: 自适应集成方法为提升大型视觉语言模型的鲁棒性提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently achieved impressive
results in multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question
answering. However, they remain prone to object hallucination -- generating
descriptions of nonexistent or misidentified objects. Prior work has partially
mitigated this via auxiliary training objectives or external modules, but
challenges remain in terms of scalability, adaptability, and model
independence. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive Token Ensemble
Decoding (ATED), a training-free, token-level ensemble framework that mitigates
hallucination by aggregating predictions from multiple LVLMs during inference.
ATED dynamically computes uncertainty-based weights for each model, reflecting
their reliability at each decoding step. It also integrates diverse decoding
paths to improve contextual grounding and semantic consistency. Experiments on
standard hallucination detection benchmarks demonstrate that ATED significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, reducing hallucination without
compromising fluency or relevance. Our findings highlight the benefits of
adaptive ensembling and point to a promising direction for improving LVLM
robustness in high-stakes applications. The code is available at

Motivation: 灾难图像分类面临数据稀缺、类内差异大和类间相似性高的挑战，现有少样本学习方法在灾难场景中效果有限。

Method: 通过线性结合Bhattacharyya系数和Hellinger距离来比较和聚合特征概率分布，提出了一种新的对比损失函数。

Result: 在四个少样本学习基准和两个灾难图像数据集上，ATTBHFA-Net表现出优于现有方法的性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: ATTBHFA-Net为灾难图像分类提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，尤其在数据稀缺情况下表现突出。

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural and human-induced disasters necessitates
advanced visual recognition techniques capable of analyzing critical
photographic data. With progress in artificial intelligence and resilient
computational systems, rapid and accurate disaster classification has become
crucial for efficient rescue operations. However, visual recognition in
disaster contexts faces significant challenges due to limited and diverse data
from the difficulties in collecting and curating comprehensive, high-quality
disaster imagery. Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data
scarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets
lacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.
Moreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class
similarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.
To address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based
Bhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which
linearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to
compare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype
formation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that
enhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes
same-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but
operates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.
Furthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is
proposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used
jointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL
performance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets
demonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net
compared to existing approaches.

Motivation: 自动驾驶闭环模拟需要真实的视图外推，但现有方法在原始轨迹外常产生扭曲和不一致的图像。

Method: 采用四阶段流程：数据驱动的伪LiDAR点云初始化、基于2D-SDF的道路几何建模、生成伪真值辅助监督、数据驱动的适应网络去除时间特定伪影。

Result: 在RealADSim-NVS基准测试中，最终得分为0.441，排名第一。

Conclusion: 该方法通过综合流程和几何先验，显著提升了视图外推的准确性和一致性。

Abstract: Realistic view extrapolation is critical for closed-loop simulation in
autonomous driving, yet it remains a significant challenge for current Novel
View Synthesis (NVS) methods, which often produce distorted and inconsistent
images beyond the original trajectory. This report presents our winning
solution which ctook first place in the RealADSim Workshop NVS track at ICCV
2025. To address the core challenges of street view extrapolation, we introduce
a comprehensive four-stage pipeline. First, we employ a data-driven
initialization strategy to generate a robust pseudo-LiDAR point cloud, avoiding
local minima. Second, we inject strong geometric priors by modeling the road
surface with a novel dimension-reduced SDF termed 2D-SDF. Third, we leverage a
generative prior to create pseudo ground truth for extrapolated viewpoints,
providing auxilary supervision. Finally, a data-driven adaptation network
removes time-specific artifacts. On the RealADSim-NVS benchmark, our method
achieves a final score of 0.441, ranking first among all participants.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督学习和生成控制，实现了高效且可扩展的面部知识学习。

Abstract: Compared to the prosperity of pre-training models in natural image
understanding, the research on large-scale pre-training models for facial
knowledge learning is still limited. Current approaches mainly rely on manually
assembled and annotated face datasets for training, but labeling such datasets
is labor-intensive and the trained models have limited scalability beyond the
training data. To address these limitations, we present a generative
pre-training model for facial knowledge learning that leverages large-scale
web-built data for training. We use texts and images containing human faces
crawled from the internet and conduct pre-training on self-supervised tasks,
including masked image/language modeling (MILM) and image-text matching (ITM).
During the generation stage, we further utilize the image-text matching loss to
pull the generation distribution towards the control signal for controllable
image/text generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves
comparable performance to state-of-the-art pre-training models for various
facial downstream tasks, such as attribution classification and expression
recognition. Furthermore, our approach is also applicable to a wide range of
face editing tasks, including face attribute editing, expression manipulation,
mask removal, and photo inpainting.

TL;DR: AV-Master框架通过动态建模时间和模态维度，提升模型在复杂视听场景中提取关键信息的能力，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在时间采样和模态偏好感知上缺乏灵活性和动态适应性，限制了复杂场景下的推理能力。

Method: 提出动态自适应聚焦采样机制和偏好感知策略，结合双路径对比损失，增强时间和模态维度的协同表示。

Result: 在四个大规模基准测试中表现优异，尤其在复杂推理任务中。

Conclusion: AV-Master通过动态建模和协同表示学习，有效解决了视听问答中的冗余和碎片化问题。

Abstract: Audio-Visual Question Answering (AVQA) requires models to effectively utilize
both visual and auditory modalities to answer complex and diverse questions
about audio-visual scenes. However, existing methods lack sufficient
flexibility and dynamic adaptability in temporal sampling and modality
preference awareness, making it difficult to focus on key information based on
the question. This limits their reasoning capability in complex scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named AV-Master. It
enhances the model's ability to extract key information from complex
audio-visual scenes with substantial redundant content by dynamically modeling
both temporal and modality dimensions. In the temporal dimension, we introduce
a dynamic adaptive focus sampling mechanism that progressively focuses on
audio-visual segments most relevant to the question, effectively mitigating
redundancy and segment fragmentation in traditional sampling methods. In the
modality dimension, we propose a preference-aware strategy that models each
modality's contribution independently, enabling selective activation of
critical features. Furthermore, we introduce a dual-path contrastive loss to
reinforce consistency and complementarity across temporal and modality
dimensions, guiding the model to learn question-specific cross-modal
collaborative representations. Experiments on four large-scale benchmarks show
that AV-Master significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in
complex reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 现有DPO方法在估计图像概率和离线数据多样性方面存在挑战，Diffusion-DRO旨在通过逆强化学习框架解决这些问题。

Method: Diffusion-DRO将偏好学习转化为排序问题，简化训练目标为去噪形式，并整合离线专家演示和在线策略生成的负样本。

Result: 实验表明，Diffusion-DRO在生成质量和用户研究中优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRO通过简化训练目标和结合离线与在线数据，显著提升了文本到图像扩散模型的偏好对齐能力。

Abstract: Direct preference optimization (DPO) methods have shown strong potential in
aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preferences by training on
paired comparisons. These methods improve training stability by avoiding the
REINFORCE algorithm but still struggle with challenges such as accurately
estimating image probabilities due to the non-linear nature of the sigmoid
function and the limited diversity of offline datasets. In this paper, we
introduce Diffusion Denoising Ranking Optimization (Diffusion-DRO), a new
preference learning framework grounded in inverse reinforcement learning.
Diffusion-DRO removes the dependency on a reward model by casting preference
learning as a ranking problem, thereby simplifying the training objective into
a denoising formulation and overcoming the non-linear estimation issues found
in prior methods. Moreover, Diffusion-DRO uniquely integrates offline expert
demonstrations with online policy-generated negative samples, enabling it to
effectively capture human preferences while addressing the limitations of
offline data. Comprehensive experiments show that Diffusion-DRO delivers
improved generation quality across a range of challenging and unseen prompts,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both both quantitative metrics and
user studies. Our source code and pre-trained models are available at

TL;DR: GroupHOI通过几何邻近性和语义相似性建模群体行为，提升了人-物交互检测的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注成对关系，忽略了现实场景中交互常源于群体行为。

Method: 使用可学习的邻近性估计器将人和物分组，通过自注意力机制聚合上下文信息，并增强语义相似性。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中表现优异，在NVI-DET任务中领先。

Conclusion: GroupHOI通过群体视角建模交互，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Detection (HOI-DET) aims to localize human-object
pairs and identify their interactive relationships. To aggregate contextual
cues, existing methods typically propagate information across all detected
entities via self-attention mechanisms, or establish message passing between
humans and objects with bipartite graphs. However, they primarily focus on
pairwise relationships, overlooking that interactions in real-world scenarios
often emerge from collective behaviors (multiple humans and objects engaging in
joint activities). In light of this, we revisit relation modeling from a group
view and propose GroupHOI, a framework that propagates contextual information
in terms of geometric proximity and semantic similarity. To exploit the
geometric proximity, humans and objects are grouped into distinct clusters
using a learnable proximity estimator based on spatial features derived from
bounding boxes. In each group, a soft correspondence is computed via
self-attention to aggregate and dispatch contextual cues. To incorporate the
semantic similarity, we enhance the vanilla transformer-based interaction
decoder with local contextual cues from HO-pair features. Extensive experiments
on HICO-DET and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of GroupHOI over
the state-of-the-art methods. It also exhibits leading performance on the more
challenging Nonverbal Interaction Detection (NVI-DET) task, which involves
varied forms of higher-order interactions within groups.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒攻击方法需要多次查询，不适用于现实场景和新兴的Video-LLMs。

Method: 通过提取DNN的特征信息，直接改变视频特征空间，实现零查询攻击。

Result: 攻击成功率超过70%，且生成的对抗视频质量高，难以察觉。

Conclusion: FeatureFool是一种高效、隐蔽的视频领域攻击方法，适用于传统分类器和Video-LLMs。

Abstract: The vulnerability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has been preliminarily
verified. Existing black-box adversarial attacks usually require multi-round
interaction with the model and consume numerous queries, which is impractical
in the real-world and hard to scale to recently emerged Video-LLMs. Moreover,
no attack in the video domain directly leverages feature maps to shift the
clean-video feature space. We therefore propose FeatureFool, a stealthy,
video-domain, zero-query black-box attack that utilizes information extracted
from a DNN to alter the feature space of clean videos. Unlike query-based
methods that rely on iterative interaction, FeatureFool performs a zero-query
attack by directly exploiting DNN-extracted information. This efficient
approach is unprecedented in the video domain. Experiments show that
FeatureFool achieves an attack success rate above 70\% against traditional
video classifiers without any queries. Benefiting from the transferability of
the feature map, it can also craft harmful content and bypass Video-LLM
recognition. Additionally, adversarial videos generated by FeatureFool exhibit
high quality in terms of SSIM, PSNR, and Temporal-Inconsistency, making the
attack barely perceptible. This paper may contain violent or explicit content.

Conclusion: 跨模态场景语义对齐能有效提升图像复杂度评估的性能，使其更符合人类主观感知。

Abstract: Image complexity assessment (ICA) is a challenging task in perceptual
evaluation due to the subjective nature of human perception and the inherent
semantic diversity in real-world images. Existing ICA methods predominantly
rely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of
a single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived
representations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal
scene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various
computer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.
However, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the
context of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a
novel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which
leverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance
ICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with
subjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a
complexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch. The
complexity regression branch estimates image complexity levels under the
guidance of the scene semantic alignment branch, while the scene semantic
alignment branch is used to align images with corresponding text prompts that
convey rich scene semantic information by pair-wise learning. Extensive
experiments on several ICA datasets demonstrate that the proposed CM-SSA
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. Codes are available at

Conclusion: S2AP通过优化分数空间锐度，显著提升了对抗性剪枝方法的性能。

Abstract: Adversarial pruning methods have emerged as a powerful tool for compressing
neural networks while preserving robustness against adversarial attacks. These
methods typically follow a three-step pipeline: (i) pretrain a robust model,
(ii) select a binary mask for weight pruning, and (iii) finetune the pruned
model. To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by
assigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with
the highest scores. However, this score-space optimization can lead to sharp
local minima in the robust loss landscape and, in turn, to an unstable mask
selection, reducing the robustness of adversarial pruning methods. To overcome
this issue, we propose a novel plug-in method for adversarial pruning, termed
Score-space Sharpness-aware Adversarial Pruning (S2AP). Through our method, we
introduce the concept of score-space sharpness minimization, which operates
during the mask search by perturbing importance scores and minimizing the
corresponding robust loss. Extensive experiments across various datasets,
models, and sparsity levels demonstrate that S2AP effectively minimizes
sharpness in score space, stabilizing the mask selection, and ultimately
improving the robustness of adversarial pruning methods.

Result: MLP和Logistic Regression分类器表现最佳，准确率和F1分数达98.62%。

Conclusion: 该方法为皮质形态测量提供了强大且稳健的指标，有望提升AD研究和诊断的临床应用。

Abstract: Background and Objective: In brain imaging, geometric surface models are
essential for analyzing the 3D shapes of anatomical structures. Alzheimer's
disease (AD) is associated with significant cortical atrophy, making such shape
analysis a valuable diagnostic tool. The objective of this study is to
introduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the
automated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted
MRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models
were reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes
were computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were
derived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian
curvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry. Shannon entropy was
applied to these three features to create compact and informative feature
vectors. The feature vectors were used to train and evaluate a suite of
classifiers (e.g. XGBoost, MLP, Logistic Regression, etc.). Results:
Statistical significance of performance differences between classifiers was
evaluated using paired Welch's t-test. The method proved highly effective in
distinguishing AD patients from healthy controls. The Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP) and Logistic Regression classifiers outperformed all others, achieving an
accuracy and F$_1$ Score of 98.62%. Conclusions: This study confirms that the
entropy of conformally-derived geometric features provides a powerful and
robust metric for cortical morphometry. The high classification accuracy
underscores the method's potential to enhance the study and diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease, offering a straightforward yet powerful tool for clinical
research applications.

Conclusion: BFCTN方法有效解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了融合性能。

Abstract: Tensor decomposition is a powerful tool for data analysis and has been
extensively employed in the field of hyperspectral-multispectral image fusion
(HMF). Existing tensor decomposition-based fusion methods typically rely on
disruptive data vectorization/reshaping or impose rigid constraints on the
arrangement of factor tensors, hindering the preservation of spatial-spectral
structures and the modeling of cross-dimensional correlations. Although recent
advances utilizing the Fully-Connected Tensor Network (FCTN) decomposition have
partially alleviated these limitations, the process of reorganizing data into
higher-order tensors still disrupts the intrinsic spatial-spectral structure.
Furthermore, these methods necessitate extensive manual parameter tuning and
exhibit limited robustness against noise and spatial degradation. To alleviate
these issues, we propose the Bayesian FCTN (BFCTN) method. Within this
probabilistic framework, a hierarchical sparse prior that characterizing the
sparsity of physical elements, establishes connections between the factor
tensors. This framework explicitly models the intrinsic physical coupling among
spatial structures, spectral signatures, and local scene homogeneity. For model
learning, we develop a parameter estimation method based on Variational
Bayesian inference (VB) and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, which
significantly reduces the need for manual parameter tuning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that BFCTN not only achieves state-of-the-art fusion
accuracy and strong robustness but also exhibits practical applicability in
complex real-world scenarios.

Abstract: This paper presents an automated system for cricket video analysis that
leverages deep learning techniques to extract wicket-taking deliveries, detect
cricket balls, and model ball trajectories. The system employs the YOLOv8
architecture for pitch and ball detection, combined with optical character
recognition (OCR) for scorecard extraction to identify wicket-taking moments.
Through comprehensive image preprocessing, including grayscale transformation,
power transformation, and morphological operations, the system achieves robust
text extraction from video frames. The pitch detection model achieved 99.5%
mean Average Precision at 50% IoU (mAP50) with a precision of 0.999, while the
ball detection model using transfer learning attained 99.18% mAP50 with 0.968
precision and 0.978 recall. The system enables trajectory modeling on detected
pitches, providing data-driven insights for identifying batting weaknesses.
Experimental results on multiple cricket match videos demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach for automated cricket analytics, offering
significant potential for coaching and strategic decision-making.

*Zhiwei Hao,Jianyuan Guo,Li Shen,Kai Han,Yehui Tang,Han Hu,Yunhe Wang*

TL;DR: ScaleNet是一种高效扩展ViT模型的方法，通过插入额外层和权重共享减少计算成本，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模ViT模型训练成本高的问题，提供经济高效的扩展方案。

Method: 在预训练ViT中插入额外层，采用权重共享和调整参数优化性能。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上，2倍深度扩展的DeiT-Base模型性能提升7.42%，训练周期减少三分之二。

Conclusion: ScaleNet高效且适用于下游视觉任务，如目标检测。

Abstract: Recent advancements in vision transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated that
larger models often achieve superior performance. However, training these
models remains computationally intensive and costly. To address this challenge,
we introduce ScaleNet, an efficient approach for scaling ViT models. Unlike
conventional training from scratch, ScaleNet facilitates rapid model expansion
with negligible increases in parameters, building on existing pretrained
models. This offers a cost-effective solution for scaling up ViTs.
Specifically, ScaleNet achieves model expansion by inserting additional layers
into pretrained ViTs, utilizing layer-wise weight sharing to maintain
parameters efficiency. Each added layer shares its parameter tensor with a
corresponding layer from the pretrained model. To mitigate potential
performance degradation due to shared weights, ScaleNet introduces a small set
of adjustment parameters for each layer. These adjustment parameters are
implemented through parallel adapter modules, ensuring that each instance of
the shared parameter tensor remains distinct and optimized for its specific
function. Experiments on the ImageNet-1K dataset demonstrate that ScaleNet
enables efficient expansion of ViT models. With a 2$\times$ depth-scaled
DeiT-Base model, ScaleNet achieves a 7.42% accuracy improvement over training
from scratch while requiring only one-third of the training epochs,
highlighting its efficiency in scaling ViTs. Beyond image classification, our
method shows significant potential for application in downstream vision areas,
as evidenced by the validation in object detection task.

TL;DR: ImageGem数据集支持生成模型个性化研究，通过用户偏好注释提升对齐模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 缺乏细粒度用户偏好注释阻碍了生成模型的发展。

Method: 利用57K用户的真实交互数据，训练偏好对齐模型，并研究检索模型和视觉语言模型的性能。

Result: 数据集首次实现了生成模型个性化的新范式。

Conclusion: ImageGem为生成模型个性化提供了有效支持。

Abstract: We introduce ImageGem, a dataset for studying generative models that
understand fine-grained individual preferences. We posit that a key challenge
hindering the development of such a generative model is the lack of in-the-wild
and fine-grained user preference annotations. Our dataset features real-world
interaction data from 57K users, who collectively have built 242K customized
LoRAs, written 3M text prompts, and created 5M generated images. With user
preference annotations from our dataset, we were able to train better
preference alignment models. In addition, leveraging individual user
preference, we investigated the performance of retrieval models and a
vision-language model on personalized image retrieval and generative model
recommendation. Finally, we propose an end-to-end framework for editing
customized diffusion models in a latent weight space to align with individual
user preferences. Our results demonstrate that the ImageGem dataset enables,
for the first time, a new paradigm for generative model personalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RISE提出了一种自增强检索范式，利用无标注训练数据生成伪标签，用于伪装目标检测（COD），通过聚类和检索策略提升原型库质量，并在KNN检索中引入多视图方法，显著优于现有无监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法主要依赖图像级建模或标注优化，未能充分利用数据集级上下文信息且依赖大量标注。RISE旨在通过无监督方式利用整个训练数据集生成高质量伪标签。

Method: RISE通过构建环境和伪装目标的原型库（无标注），采用聚类-检索（CR）策略生成高质量原型，并结合多视图KNN检索（MVKR）生成鲁棒的伪掩码。

Result: 实验表明RISE在无监督和基于提示的方法中表现最优。

Conclusion: RISE通过无监督检索和自增强策略，有效解决了COD中伪标签生成问题，为减少标注依赖提供了新思路。

Abstract: At the core of Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) lies segmenting objects
from their highly similar surroundings. Previous efforts navigate this
challenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based
optimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly
taps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious
annotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented
paradigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels
for single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by
constructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using
training images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
retrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It
is important to recognize that using only training images without annotations
exerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In
this light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where
coarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent
histogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce
high-confidence prototypes. In the KNN retrieval stage, to alleviate the effect
of artifacts in feature maps, we propose Multi-View KNN Retrieval (MVKR), which
integrates retrieval results from diverse views to produce more robust and
precise pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RISE outperforms
state-of-the-art unsupervised and prompt-based methods. Code is available at

Method: 使用单块中端GPU生成256x256x256分辨率的体积图像，通过解剖掩码（肺部和结节区域）控制输出。

Result: 实验表明仅依赖结节掩码会导致解剖错误，强调全局肺结构的重要性。

Conclusion: 该方法能生成多样化的CT体积，为AI模型或医疗专业人员提供有价值的工具。

Abstract: This work introduces a new latent diffusion model to generate high-quality 3D
chest CT scans conditioned on 3D anatomical masks. The method synthesizes
volumetric images of size 256x256x256 at 1 mm isotropic resolution using a
single mid-range GPU, significantly lowering the computational cost compared to
existing approaches. The conditioning masks delineate lung and nodule regions,
enabling precise control over the output anatomical features. Experimental
results demonstrate that conditioning solely on nodule masks leads to
anatomically incorrect outputs, highlighting the importance of incorporating
global lung structure for accurate conditional synthesis. The proposed approach
supports the generation of diverse CT volumes with and without lung nodules of
varying attributes, providing a valuable tool for training AI models or
healthcare professionals.

TL;DR: 提出VFM-VAE方法，绕过蒸馏直接整合视觉基础模型，提升潜在扩散模型的性能和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过蒸馏整合视觉基础模型会削弱对齐鲁棒性，导致语义偏差。

Method: 设计VFM-VAE，采用多尺度潜在融合和渐进分辨率重建模块，并引入SE-CKNNA指标优化训练策略。

Result: 在80轮训练后gFID达2.20（提速10倍），640轮后降至1.62，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 直接整合视觉基础模型是潜在扩散模型的更优范式。

Abstract: The performance of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) is critically dependent on
the quality of their visual tokenizer. While recent works have explored
incorporating Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) via distillation, we identify a
fundamental flaw in this approach: it inevitably weakens the robustness of
alignment with the original VFM, causing the aligned latents to deviate
semantically under distribution shifts. In this paper, we bypass distillation
by proposing a more direct approach: Vision Foundation Model Variational
Autoencoder (VFM-VAE). To resolve the inherent tension between the VFM's
semantic focus and the need for pixel-level fidelity, we redesign the VFM-VAE
decoder with Multi-Scale Latent Fusion and Progressive Resolution
Reconstruction blocks, enabling high-quality reconstruction from spatially
coarse VFM features. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of
representation dynamics during diffusion training, introducing the proposed
SE-CKNNA metric as a more precise tool for this diagnosis. This analysis allows
us to develop a joint tokenizer-diffusion alignment strategy that dramatically
accelerates convergence. Our innovations in tokenizer design and training
strategy lead to superior performance and efficiency: our system reaches a gFID
(w/o CFG) of 2.20 in merely 80 epochs (a 10x speedup over prior tokenizers).
With continued training to 640 epochs, it further attains a gFID (w/o CFG) of
1.62, establishing direct VFM integration as a superior paradigm for LDMs.

Method: 两阶段优化框架：第一阶段在正交相机坐标系中学习HDR高斯表示；第二阶段将高斯转换到世界坐标系并联合优化相机位姿。

Result: 在渲染质量和速度上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Mono4DGS-HDR为HDR视频重建提供了高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Mono4DGS-HDR, the first system for reconstructing renderable 4D
high dynamic range (HDR) scenes from unposed monocular low dynamic range (LDR)
videos captured with alternating exposures. To tackle such a challenging
problem, we present a unified framework with two-stage optimization approach
based on Gaussian Splatting. The first stage learns a video HDR Gaussian
representation in orthographic camera coordinate space, eliminating the need
for camera poses and enabling robust initial HDR video reconstruction. The
second stage transforms video Gaussians into world space and jointly refines
the world Gaussians with camera poses. Furthermore, we propose a temporal
luminance regularization strategy to enhance the temporal consistency of the
HDR appearance. Since our task has not been studied before, we construct a new
evaluation benchmark using publicly available datasets for HDR video
reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DGS-HDR
significantly outperforms alternative solutions adapted from state-of-the-art
methods in both rendering quality and speed.

Motivation: 现有方法难以适应新发布的车型，且CLIP的固定预训练权重限制了性能。

Method: 通过VLM将车辆图像转换为描述性属性，与文本特征数据库比较，结合检索结果生成提示，由语言模型推断品牌和型号。

Result: 实验显示，该方法比CLIP基线提高了近20%的识别率。

Conclusion: RAG增强的语言模型推理在智能城市应用中具有可扩展的VMMR潜力。

Abstract: Vehicle make and model recognition (VMMR) is an important task in intelligent
transportation systems, but existing approaches struggle to adapt to newly
released models. Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) provides strong
visual-text alignment, yet its fixed pretrained weights limit performance
without costly image-specific finetuning. We propose a pipeline that integrates
vision language models (VLMs) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
support zero-shot recognition through text-based reasoning. A VLM converts
vehicle images into descriptive attributes, which are compared against a
database of textual features. Relevant entries are retrieved and combined with
the description to form a prompt, and a language model (LM) infers the make and
model. This design avoids large-scale retraining and enables rapid updates by
adding textual descriptions of new vehicles. Experiments show that the proposed
method improves recognition by nearly 20% over the CLIP baseline, demonstrating
the potential of RAG-enhanced LM reasoning for scalable VMMR in smart-city
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 便利包装的普及导致大量垃圾产生，高效的垃圾分类对可持续废物管理至关重要。

Method: 开发了DWaste平台，评估了多种图像分类和目标检测模型，并使用自定义工具Annotated Lab标注数据集。

Result: EfficientNetV2S分类器准确率高（96%），但延迟和碳排放高；轻量级目标检测模型性能强（77% mAP），推理速度快（0.03s），模型尺寸小（<7MB）。量化进一步提升了效率。

Conclusion: 成功实现了“绿色AI”模型，支持边缘设备上的实时、可持续垃圾分类。

Abstract: The rise of convenience packaging has led to generation of enormous waste,
making efficient waste sorting crucial for sustainable waste management. To
address this, we developed DWaste, a computer vision-powered platform designed
for real-time waste sorting on resource-constrained smartphones and edge
devices, including offline functionality. We benchmarked various image
classification models (EfficientNetV2S/M, ResNet50/101, MobileNet) and object
detection (YOLOv8n, YOLOv11n) using a subset of our own waste data set and
annotated it using the custom tool Annotated Lab. We found a clear trade-off
between accuracy and resource consumption: the best classifier,
EfficientNetV2S, achieved high accuracy (~ 96%) but suffered from high latency
(~ 0.22s) and elevated carbon emissions. In contrast, lightweight object
detection models delivered strong performance (up to 77% mAP) with ultra-fast
inference (~ 0.03s) and significantly smaller model sizes (< 7MB), making them
ideal for real-time, low-power use. Model quantization further maximized
efficiency, substantially reducing model size and VRAM usage by up to 75%. Our
work demonstrates the successful implementation of "Greener AI" models to
support real-time, sustainable waste sorting on edge devices.

Motivation: 传统模板匹配方法在检索错误模板时会导致姿态预测不准确，因此需要一种更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 将物体姿态估计转化为射线对齐问题，使用扩散变换器架构，并结合几何先验和粗到细的训练策略。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现出色，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过射线对齐和扩散变换器架构，显著提升了姿态估计的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Typical template-based object pose pipelines estimate the pose by retrieving
the closest matching template and aligning it with the observed image. However,
failure to retrieve the correct template often leads to inaccurate pose
predictions. To address this, we reformulate template-based object pose
estimation as a ray alignment problem, where the viewing directions from
multiple posed template images are learned to align with a non-posed query
image. Inspired by recent progress in diffusion-based camera pose estimation,
we embed this formulation into a diffusion transformer architecture that aligns
a query image with a set of posed templates. We reparameterize object rotation
using object-centered camera rays and model object translation by extending
scale-invariant translation estimation to dense translation offsets. Our model
leverages geometric priors from the templates to guide accurate query pose
inference. A coarse-to-fine training strategy based on narrowed template
sampling improves performance without modifying the network architecture.
Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show competitive
results of our method compared to state-of-the-art approaches in unseen object
pose estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LiDAR的3D检测器在训练时依赖全局特征（如绝对笛卡尔坐标），导致模型过度依赖物体绝对位置而非形状和外观特征，限制了其在不同点分布（如不同传感器配置）下的泛化能力。

Abstract: This technical report outlines the top-ranking solution for RoboSense 2025:
Track 3, achieving state-of-the-art performance on 3D object detection under
various sensor placements. Our submission utilizes GBlobs, a local point cloud
feature descriptor specifically designed to enhance model generalization across
diverse LiDAR configurations. Current LiDAR-based 3D detectors often suffer
from a \enquote{geometric shortcut} when trained on conventional global
features (\ie, absolute Cartesian coordinates). This introduces a position bias
that causes models to primarily rely on absolute object position rather than
distinguishing shape and appearance characteristics. Although effective for
in-domain data, this shortcut severely limits generalization when encountering
different point distributions, such as those resulting from varying sensor
placements. By using GBlobs as network input features, we effectively
circumvent this geometric shortcut, compelling the network to learn robust,
object-centric representations. This approach significantly enhances the
model's ability to generalize, resulting in the exceptional performance
demonstrated in this challenge.

Result: 发布了首个多传感器遮挡数据集，支持在部分传感器故障和环境干扰下进行一致、可重复的评估。

Conclusion: 该数据集旨在推动鲁棒传感器融合、弹性分析和安全关键感知的研究。

Abstract: Robust perception in automated driving requires reliable performance under
adverse conditions, where sensors may be affected by partial failures or
environmental occlusions. Although existing autonomous driving datasets
inherently contain sensor noise and environmental variability, very few enable
controlled, parameterised, and reproducible degradations across multiple
sensing modalities. This gap limits the ability to systematically evaluate how
perception and fusion architectures perform under well-defined adverse
conditions. To address this limitation, we introduce the Occluded nuScenes
Dataset, a novel extension of the widely used nuScenes benchmark. For the
camera modality, we release both the full and mini versions with four types of
occlusions, two adapted from public implementations and two newly designed. For
radar and LiDAR, we provide parameterised occlusion scripts that implement
three types of degradations each, enabling flexible and repeatable generation
of occluded data. This resource supports consistent, reproducible evaluation of
perception models under partial sensor failures and environmental interference.
By releasing the first multi-sensor occlusion dataset with controlled and
reproducible degradations, we aim to advance research on robust sensor fusion,
resilience analysis, and safety-critical perception in automated driving.

Result: Kaleido在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，在一致性、保真度和泛化性上表现突出。

Conclusion: Kaleido在S2V生成领域取得了显著进展，解决了多主题一致性和背景解耦的挑战。

Abstract: We present Kaleido, a subject-to-video~(S2V) generation framework, which aims
to synthesize subject-consistent videos conditioned on multiple reference
images of target subjects. Despite recent progress in S2V generation models,
existing approaches remain inadequate at maintaining multi-subject consistency
and at handling background disentanglement, often resulting in lower reference
fidelity and semantic drift under multi-image conditioning. These shortcomings
can be attributed to several factors. Primarily, the training dataset suffers
from a lack of diversity and high-quality samples, as well as cross-paired
data, i.e., paired samples whose components originate from different instances.
In addition, the current mechanism for integrating multiple reference images is
suboptimal, potentially resulting in the confusion of multiple subjects. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a dedicated data construction pipeline,
incorporating low-quality sample filtering and diverse data synthesis, to
produce consistency-preserving training data. Moreover, we introduce Reference
Rotary Positional Encoding (R-RoPE) to process reference images, enabling
stable and precise multi-image integration. Extensive experiments across
numerous benchmarks demonstrate that Kaleido significantly outperforms previous
methods in consistency, fidelity, and generalization, marking an advance in S2V
generation.

Result: 在Flickr30K和COCO上表现优于现有方法，仅用500对合成数据即可实现检索准确率提升6.8%。

Conclusion: CovMatch通过联合优化编码器显著提升了跨模态对齐和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small set of image-text
pairs that enables efficient training of large-scale vision-language models.
While dataset distillation has shown promise in unimodal tasks, extending it to
multimodal contrastive learning presents key challenges: learning cross-modal
alignment and managing the high computational cost of large encoders. Prior
approaches address scalability by freezing the text encoder and update only the
image encoder and text projection layer. However, we find this severely limits
semantic alignment and becomes a bottleneck for performance scaling. We propose
CovMatch, a scalable dataset distillation framework that aligns the
cross-covariance of real and synthetic features while regularizing feature
distributions within each modality. Unlike prior approaches, CovMatch enables
joint optimization of both encoders, leading to stronger cross-modal alignment
and improved performance. Evaluated on Flickr30K and COCO, CovMatch outperforms
state-of-the-art multimodal distillation methods and achieves up to 6.8%
absolute gains in retrieval accuracy using only 500 synthetic pairs.

Abstract: Though recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved
remarkable progress across a wide range of multimodal tasks, understanding 3D
spatial relationships from limited views remains a significant challenge.
Previous reasoning methods typically rely on pure text (e.g., topological
cognitive maps) or on 2D visual cues. However, their limited representational
capacity hinders performance in specific tasks that require 3D spatial
imagination. To address this limitation, we propose 3DThinker, a framework that
can effectively exploits the rich geometric information embedded within images
while reasoning, like humans do. Our framework is the first to enable 3D
mentaling during reasoning without any 3D prior input, and it does not rely on
explicitly labeled 3D data for training. Specifically, our training consists of
two stages. First, we perform supervised training to align the 3D latent
generated by VLM while reasoning with that of a 3D foundation model (e.g.,
VGGT). Then, we optimize the entire reasoning trajectory solely based on
outcome signals, thereby refining the underlying 3D mentaling. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks show that 3DThinker consistently
outperforms strong baselines and offers a new perspective toward unifying 3D
representations into multimodal reasoning. Our code will be available at

can find it overwhelming. We introduce {\epsilon}-Seg, a method based on
hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), employing center-region masking,
sparse label contrastive learning (CL), a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) prior,
and clustering-free label prediction. Center-region masking and the inpainting
loss encourage the model to learn robust and representative embeddings to
distinguish the desired classes, even if training labels are sparse (0.05% of
the total image data or less). For optimal performance, we employ CL and a GMM
prior to shape the latent space of the HVAE such that encoded input patches
tend to cluster wrt. the semantic classes we wish to distinguish. Finally,
instead of clustering latent embeddings for semantic segmentation, we propose a
MLP semantic segmentation head to directly predict class labels from latent
embeddings. We show empirical results of {\epsilon}-Seg and baseline methods on
2 dense EM datasets of biological tissues and demonstrate the applicability of
our method also on fluorescence microscopy data. Our results show that
{\epsilon}-Seg is capable of achieving competitive sparsely-supervised
segmentation results on complex biological image data, even if only limited
amounts of training labels are available.

*Kyo Kuroki,Yasuyuki Okoshi,Thiem Van Chu,Kazushi Kawamura,Masato Motomura*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的矩阵量化方法BQQ，通过二进制二次表达式实现高效矩阵近似和神经网络压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的一阶量化方法（如均匀量化和二进制编码量化）通过线性组合二进制基来近似实值矩阵，而BQQ利用二进制二次表达式的表达能力，同时保持极紧凑的数据格式。

Method: 采用二进制二次表达式（BQQ）进行矩阵量化，并在矩阵压缩基准和预训练视觉Transformer模型的训练后量化（PTQ）中验证。

Result: BQQ在矩阵压缩和PTQ中表现优于传统方法，例如在ImageNet数据集上比现有PTQ方法最高提升2.2%和59.1%。

Conclusion: 二进制二次表达式在矩阵近似和神经网络压缩中表现出惊人的有效性。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel matrix quantization method, Binary Quadratic
Quantization (BQQ). In contrast to conventional first-order quantization
approaches, such as uniform quantization and binary coding quantization, that
approximate real-valued matrices via linear combinations of binary bases, BQQ
leverages the expressive power of binary quadratic expressions while
maintaining an extremely compact data format. We validate our approach with two
experiments: a matrix compression benchmark and post-training quantization
(PTQ) on pretrained Vision Transformer-based models. Experimental results
demonstrate that BQQ consistently achieves a superior trade-off between memory
efficiency and reconstruction error than conventional methods for compressing
diverse matrix data. It also delivers strong PTQ performance, even though we
neither target state-of-the-art PTQ accuracy under tight memory constraints nor
rely on PTQ-specific binary matrix optimization. For example, our proposed
method outperforms the state-of-the-art PTQ method by up to 2.2\% and 59.1% on
the ImageNet dataset under the calibration-based and data-free scenarios,
respectively, with quantization equivalent to 2 bits. These findings highlight
the surprising effectiveness of binary quadratic expressions for efficient
matrix approximation and neural network compression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变化检测方法需要大量标注数据，而主动学习通过迭代查询用户（oracle）减少标注需求，但现有方法在数据增强方面存在不足。

Method: 采用可逆网络将非线性输入空间映射到线性潜在空间，实现高效数据增强，并通过动态更新模型提升检测效果。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上优于现有相关工作。

Conclusion: 提出的可逆网络和主动学习框架有效提升了变化检测的效率和准确性。

Abstract: This paper devises a novel interactive satellite image change detection
algorithm based on active learning. Our framework employs an iterative process
that leverages a question-and-answer model. This model queries the oracle
(user) about the labels of a small subset of images (dubbed as display), and
based on the oracle's responses, change detection model is dynamically updated.
The main contribution of our framework resides in a novel invertible network
that allows augmenting displays, by mapping them from highly nonlinear input
spaces to latent ones, where augmentation transformations become linear and
more tractable. The resulting augmented data are afterwards mapped back to the
input space, and used to retrain more effective change detection criteria in
the subsequent iterations of active learning. Experimental results demonstrate
superior performance of our proposed method compared to the related work.

TL;DR: 论文研究了影响端到端深度学习方法在历史笔迹识别（HWI）中性能的因素，发现现有模型在零样本场景下泛化能力不足，但通过优化设计可实现与传统方法相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史笔迹识别因笔迹多样性、文档退化和标记样本有限而具有挑战性，传统方法依赖手工特征，端到端方法虽自动化但泛化能力不足。

Method: 探索了不同预处理方法、主干架构和后处理策略（如文本分割、补丁采样和特征聚合）的组合。

Result: 多数配置因低层视觉特征捕捉不足、补丁表示不一致和对内容噪声敏感而表现不佳，但发现一种简单设计的端到端方案性能接近最优系统。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了构建鲁棒端到端系统的关键挑战，并提供了优化历史笔迹识别性能的设计思路。

Abstract: This paper investigates various factors that influence the performance of
end-to-end deep learning approaches for historical writer identification (HWI),
a task that remains challenging due to the diversity of handwriting styles,
document degradation, and the limited number of labelled samples per writer.
These conditions often make accurate recognition difficult, even for human
experts. Traditional HWI methods typically rely on handcrafted image processing
and clustering techniques, which tend to perform well on small and carefully
curated datasets. In contrast, end-to-end pipelines aim to automate the process
by learning features directly from document images. However, our experiments
show that many of these models struggle to generalise in more realistic,
document-level settings, especially under zero-shot scenarios where writers in
the test set are not present in the training data. We explore different
combinations of pre-processing methods, backbone architectures, and
post-processing strategies, including text segmentation, patch sampling, and
feature aggregation. The results suggest that most configurations perform
poorly due to weak capture of low-level visual features, inconsistent patch
representations, and high sensitivity to content noise. Still, we identify one
end-to-end setup that achieves results comparable to the top-performing system,
despite using a simpler design. These findings point to key challenges in
building robust end-to-end systems and offer insight into design choices that
improve performance in historical document writer identification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频生成中，全注意力的二次计算复杂度成为瓶颈，现有稀疏方法依赖块状估计，精度和效率受限。

Method: 引入Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA)，通过轻量级可学习的token路由器精确匹配token，避免块状估计，支持长程交互。

Result: 基于MoGA的模型实现了580k上下文长度的分钟级、多镜头、480p视频生成，24 fps。

Conclusion: MoGA在多种视频生成任务中验证了其有效性，为长视频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Long video generation with Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by
the quadratic scaling of full attention with sequence length. Since attention
is highly redundant, outputs are dominated by a small subset of query-key
pairs. Existing sparse methods rely on blockwise coarse estimation, whose
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs are constrained by block size. This paper
introduces Mixture-of-Groups Attention (MoGA), an efficient sparse attention
that uses a lightweight, learnable token router to precisely match tokens
without blockwise estimation. Through semantic-aware routing, MoGA enables
effective long-range interactions. As a kernel-free method, MoGA integrates
seamlessly with modern attention stacks, including FlashAttention and sequence
parallelism. Building on MoGA, we develop an efficient long video generation
model that end-to-end produces minute-level, multi-shot, 480p videos at 24 fps,
with a context length of approximately 580k. Comprehensive experiments on
various video generation tasks validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Motivation: 现有基准缺乏多样性和多语言支持，且评估维度不够细粒度，无法满足实际需求。

Method: 构建包含600个提示的分层基准，涵盖5个主题和20个子主题，提供中英文短长版本，利用Gemini-2.5-Pro进行可靠评估。

Result: 系统揭示了开源和闭源T2I模型在不同方面的优缺点。

Conclusion: UniGenBench++为T2I模型的语义评估提供了全面且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) generation underscores the importance
of reliable benchmarks in evaluating how accurately generated images reflect
the semantics of their textual prompt. However, (1) existing benchmarks lack
the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for
real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary
dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in
fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we
introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I
generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to
ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world
scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively
probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation
criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess
model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both
English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging
the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities
of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e.,
Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark
construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate
community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline
assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both
open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths
and weaknesses across various aspects.

TL;DR: VC2L是一种基于视觉的对比学习框架，通过将文本和图像统一渲染为图像，简化了多模态处理，并在多个基准测试中表现优于CLIP模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对比学习模型（如CLIP）在处理复杂网页文档时表现有限，尤其是文本和图像松散对齐或嵌入视觉形式的情况。

Method: VC2L通过单一视觉Transformer在像素空间中统一处理文本和图像，采用片段级对比学习目标，无需显式配对数据。

Result: VC2L在跨模态检索、序列理解和泛化能力上优于CLIP，验证了多模态网页数据的训练潜力。

Conclusion: VC2L展示了统一视觉中心方法在多模态表示学习中的可扩展性和有效性。

Abstract: Contrastive vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong
performance across a wide range of multimodal tasks by learning from aligned
image-text pairs. However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web
documents remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are
interleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these
challenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified
framework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single
vision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all
inputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the
need for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture
complex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a
snippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal
segments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring
explicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this
approach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,
designed to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential
understanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical
results show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
CLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such
as M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web
data as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate
the scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal
representation learning. Code and models are available at:

Motivation: 现有的基于transformer的动作识别方法在场景相关数据集上表现良好，但在运动敏感数据集上表现不佳，缺乏精细的运动建模设计。

Method: 提出EMIM模块，通过cost volume风格的亲和矩阵构建，结合查询邻域采样和滑动窗口方式，增强运动建模能力。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的数据集上验证了方法的运动建模能力，尤其在Something-Something V1 & V2上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: EMIM模块有效提升了transformer在运动敏感数据集上的性能，证明了其运动建模设计的优越性。

Abstract: Recently, action recognition has been dominated by transformer-based methods,
thanks to their spatiotemporal contextual aggregation capacities. However,
despite the significant progress achieved on scene-related datasets, they do
not perform well on motion-sensitive datasets due to the lack of elaborate
motion modeling designs. Meanwhile, we observe that the widely-used cost volume
in traditional action recognition is highly similar to the affinity matrix
defined in self-attention, but equipped with powerful motion modeling
capacities. In light of this, we propose to integrate those effective motion
modeling properties into the existing transformer in a unified and neat way,
with the proposal of the Explicit Motion Information Mining module (EMIM). In
EMIM, we propose to construct the desirable affinity matrix in a cost volume
style, where the set of key candidate tokens is sampled from the query-based
neighboring area in the next frame in a sliding-window manner. Then, the
constructed affinity matrix is used to aggregate contextual information for
appearance modeling and is converted into motion features for motion modeling
as well. We validate the motion modeling capacities of our method on four
widely-used datasets, and our method performs better than existing
state-of-the-art approaches, especially on motion-sensitive datasets, i.e.,
Something-Something V1 & V2.

Abstract: This paper addresses metric 3D reconstruction of indoor scenes by exploiting
their inherent geometric regularities with compact representations. Using
planar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -
we introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction
from unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to
extract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and
supervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are
propagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of
primitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations
during training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane
supervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using
only depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene
datasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to
out-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation
protocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative
pose estimation. Furthermore, by formulating with planar 3D representation, our
method emerges with the ability for accurate plane segmentation. The project

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归图像生成模型（如Janus-Pro）因大量视觉令牌导致高内存和计算成本，而KV缓存压缩在图像生成领域尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过识别空间局部性和语义汇聚现象，将注意力头自适应解耦为两种类型：空间局部性头保留短令牌窗口，语义汇聚头保留高注意力令牌集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法实现了5倍内存减少和6.6倍吞吐加速，视觉质量损失极小。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了资源受限硬件上的自回归图像生成效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive image generation models like Janus-Pro produce high-quality
images, but at the significant cost of high memory and ever-growing
computational demands due to the large number of visual tokens. While KV cache
compression has been extensively studied in language modeling, it still remains
largely unexplored for the image generation domain. In this work, we begin by
identifying a distinct and prominent attention phenomenon, which we term
spatial locality and emergent semantic sink. To leverage this key insight, we
introduce a novel KV cache compression framework. Specifically, we compress the
KV cache for all visual tokens by adaptively decoupling attention heads into
two separate types: for spatial-locality heads, our method maintains a short
recent token window; for semantic-sink heads, it strategically preserves a
compact set of highly-attended tokens. Our extensive experiments demonstrate
that the proposed method achieves a 5$\times$ reduction in memory usage and a
notable 6.6$\times$ speedup in overall throughput with only minimal visual
quality loss, thereby enabling highly efficient native autoregressive image
generation on resource-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要评估视频字幕的描述全面性，而忽略了指令跟随能力，因此需要一个新的评估标准。

Method: 引入IF-VidCap基准测试，包含1,400个高质量样本，通过格式正确性和内容正确性两个维度评估字幕。

Result: 评估了20多个模型，发现专有模型仍占主导，但开源模型性能接近；密集字幕专用模型在复杂指令上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 未来工作需同时提升描述丰富性和指令跟随能力。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
proficiency in video captioning, practical applications require captions that
follow specific user instructions rather than generating exhaustive,
unconstrained descriptions. Current benchmarks, however, primarily assess
descriptive comprehensiveness while largely overlooking instruction-following
capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce IF-VidCap, a new benchmark for
evaluating controllable video captioning, which contains 1,400 high-quality
samples. Distinct from existing video captioning or general
instruction-following benchmarks, IF-VidCap incorporates a systematic framework
that assesses captions on two dimensions: format correctness and content
correctness. Our comprehensive evaluation of over 20 prominent models reveals a
nuanced landscape: despite the continued dominance of proprietary models, the
performance gap is closing, with top-tier open-source solutions now achieving
near-parity. Furthermore, we find that models specialized for dense captioning
underperform general-purpose MLLMs on complex instructions, indicating that
future work should simultaneously advance both descriptive richness and
instruction-following fidelity.

Conclusion: ColIAGS通过改进的光照和几何建模，显著提升了结肠镜场景下的3D重建质量，优于现有方法。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a pivotal technique for real-time
view synthesis in colonoscopy, enabling critical applications such as virtual
colonoscopy and lesion tracking. However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static
illumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,
which causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic
scenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS
methods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the
camera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately
degrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the
illumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical
characters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an
improved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance
under varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with
two types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt
to photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the
geometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved
Geometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian
geometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is
leveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.
Comprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our
proposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and
accurate geometric reconstruction. It notably outperforms other
state-of-the-art methods by achieving superior rendering fidelity while
significantly reducing Depth MSE. Code will be available.

Conclusion: SEAL通过自然层次结构和创新方法有效解决了GCD问题。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD).
Given a partially labelled dataset, GCD aims to categorize all unlabelled
images, regardless of whether they belong to known or unknown classes. Existing
approaches typically depend on either single-level semantics or manually
designed abstract hierarchies, which limit their generalizability and
scalability. To address these limitations, we introduce a SEmantic-aware
hierArchical Learning framework (SEAL), guided by naturally occurring and
easily accessible hierarchical structures. Within SEAL, we propose a
Hierarchical Semantic-Guided Soft Contrastive Learning approach that exploits
hierarchical similarity to generate informative soft negatives, addressing the
limitations of conventional contrastive losses that treat all negatives
equally. Furthermore, a Cross-Granularity Consistency (CGC) module is designed
to align the predictions from different levels of granularity. SEAL
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on fine-grained benchmarks,
including the SSB benchmark, Oxford-Pet, and the Herbarium19 dataset, and
further demonstrates generalization on coarse-grained datasets. Project page:

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data, yet conventional machine learning
models with limited data often produce inaccurate predictions, particularly in
underserved areas. Geospatial foundation models trained on global unstructured
data offer a promising alternative by demonstrating strong generalization and
requiring only minimal fine-tuning. In this study, an empirical ground truth of
urban heat patterns is established by quantifying cooling effects from green
spaces and benchmarking them against model predictions to evaluate the model's
accuracy. The foundation model is subsequently fine-tuned to predict land
surface temperatures under future climate scenarios, and its practical value is
demonstrated through a simulated inpainting that highlights its role for
mitigation support. The results indicate that foundation models offer a
powerful way for evaluating urban heat island mitigation strategies in
data-scarce regions to support more climate-resilient cities.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散变换器的视频生成模型因注意力机制的二次计算复杂度，难以实现高分辨率（1080P/2K/4K）视频生成。

Method: 采用全局-局部注意力分解的分层双分支注意力架构，结合空间压缩全局建模策略和分层跨窗口局部注意力机制。

Result: UltraGen首次将预训练低分辨率视频模型扩展到1080P和4K分辨率，在质量和数量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UltraGen解决了高分辨率视频生成的瓶颈，为高效、高质量视频合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have made it possible to produce visually
compelling videos, with wide-ranging applications in content creation,
entertainment, and virtual reality. However, most existing diffusion
transformer based video generation models are limited to low-resolution outputs
(<=720P) due to the quadratic computational complexity of the attention
mechanism with respect to the output width and height. This computational
bottleneck makes native high-resolution video generation (1080P/2K/4K)
impractical for both training and inference. To address this challenge, we
present UltraGen, a novel video generation framework that enables i) efficient
and ii) end-to-end native high-resolution video synthesis. Specifically,
UltraGen features a hierarchical dual-branch attention architecture based on
global-local attention decomposition, which decouples full attention into a
local attention branch for high-fidelity regional content and a global
attention branch for overall semantic consistency. We further propose a
spatially compressed global modeling strategy to efficiently learn global
dependencies, and a hierarchical cross-window local attention mechanism to
reduce computational costs while enhancing information flow across different
local windows. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UltraGen can effectively
scale pre-trained low-resolution video models to 1080P and even 4K resolution

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的“叛逆学生”框架，通过互补特征学习整合光谱和空间线索，提升高光谱异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在背景数据集上训练后可直接部署，但缺乏对光谱和空间线索的整合。本文旨在通过互补学习提升检测效果。

Method: 采用两阶段学习策略：1) 通过反向蒸馏训练光谱增强网络；2) 使用去相关损失优化空间网络（叛逆学生），强制特征正交性。

Result: 在HAD100基准测试中显著优于基线方法，计算开销低。

Conclusion: 互补学习框架有效提升了高光谱异常检测的性能和通用性。

Abstract: A recent class of hyperspectral anomaly detection methods that can be trained
once on background datasets and then universally deployed -- without per-scene
retraining or parameter tuning -- has demonstrated remarkable efficiency and
robustness. Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of
spectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel "Rebellious Student" framework
for complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student
paradigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial
branch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary
spatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning
strategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via
reverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and
(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized
using decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining
reconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework
enhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free
and training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.
Extensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements
over several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,
confirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary
learning paradigm. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: ProCLIP提出了一种基于课程学习的渐进式视觉-语言对齐框架，以解决CLIP文本编码器在处理长文本和多语言输入时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP文本编码器因输入长度限制和多语言支持不足，限制了其广泛应用。现有方法直接对齐LLM和CLIP可能导致视觉-语言对齐破坏。

Method: ProCLIP通过知识蒸馏和对比学习逐步对齐CLIP图像编码器与LLM嵌入器，使用自蒸馏正则化和语义对齐损失。

Result: ProCLIP有效利用了CLIP的预训练知识，避免了直接对齐的负面影响，实现了更优的视觉-语言对齐。

Conclusion: ProCLIP为长文本和多语言任务提供了一种高效的视觉-语言对齐解决方案。

Abstract: The original CLIP text encoder is limited by a maximum input length of 77
tokens, which hampers its ability to effectively process long texts and perform
fine-grained semantic understanding. In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks
support for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict
its applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have
attempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to
enhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and
fine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces
of LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently
without alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can
disrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,
leading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.
To address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based
progressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP
image encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills
knowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage
CLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between
the LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns
the CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text
contrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid
overfitting. To achieve a more effective alignment, instance semantic alignment
loss and embedding structure alignment loss are employed during representation
inheritance and contrastive tuning. The Code is available at

Abstract: In contrast to the somewhat abstract, group theoretical approach adopted by

convolutional neural networks in $d$ dimensions. This derivation is based on
geometric arguments and fundamental principles of pattern matching. We offer an
intuitive explanation for the appearance of the Clebsch--Gordan decomposition
and spherical harmonic basis functions. Furthermore, we suggest a novel way to
construct steerable convolution layers using interpolation kernels that improve
upon existing implementation, and offer greater robustness to noisy data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结核病在资源有限地区仍是重大健康问题，早期检测需求迫切，但缺乏专业放射科医生，因此需要可靠的AI筛查工具。

Method: 采用教师-学生框架，结合两个监督头和一个自监督头，提升疾病和症状检测能力。

Result: 模型在区分COVID-19、结核病和正常病例上准确率达98.85%，多标签症状检测的宏F1分数为90.09%。

Conclusion: 模型在临床筛查和分诊中表现出潜力，且解释性评估显示其预测基于相关解剖特征。

Abstract: Tuberculosis remains a critical global health issue, particularly in
resource-limited and remote areas. Early detection is vital for treatment, yet
the lack of skilled radiologists underscores the need for artificial
intelligence (AI)-driven screening tools. Developing reliable AI models is
challenging due to the necessity for large, high-quality datasets, which are
costly to obtain. To tackle this, we propose a teacher--student framework which
enhances both disease and symptom detection on chest X-rays by integrating two
supervised heads and a self-supervised head. Our model achieves an accuracy of
98.85% for distinguishing between COVID-19, tuberculosis, and normal cases, and
a macro-F1 score of 90.09% for multilabel symptom detection, significantly
outperforming baselines. The explainability assessments also show the model
bases its predictions on relevant anatomical features, demonstrating promise
for deployment in clinical screening and triage settings.

Motivation: 现有跟踪器通常针对单一任务设计，缺乏泛化能力且冗余。SAM 2++ 旨在统一不同粒度的跟踪任务。

Method: 设计任务特定提示、统一解码器、任务自适应内存机制，并构建多粒度数据集 Tracking-Any-Granularity。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到新最优性能，验证了统一框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SAM 2++ 提供了一个统一且鲁棒的跟踪框架，支持多粒度任务，显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Video tracking aims at finding the specific target in subsequent frames given
its initial state. Due to the varying granularity of target states across
different tasks, most existing trackers are tailored to a single task and
heavily rely on custom-designed modules within the individual task, which
limits their generalization and leads to redundancy in both model design and
parameters. To unify video tracking tasks, we present SAM 2++, a unified model
towards tracking at any granularity, including masks, boxes, and points. First,
to extend target granularity, we design task-specific prompts to encode various
task inputs into general prompt embeddings, and a unified decoder to unify
diverse task results into a unified form pre-output. Next, to satisfy memory
matching, the core operation of tracking, we introduce a task-adaptive memory
mechanism that unifies memory across different granularities. Finally, we
introduce a customized data engine to support tracking training at any
granularity, producing a large and diverse video tracking dataset with rich
annotations at three granularities, termed Tracking-Any-Granularity, which
represents a comprehensive resource for training and benchmarking on unified
tracking. Comprehensive experiments on multiple benchmarks confirm that SAM 2++
sets a new state of the art across diverse tracking tasks at different
granularities, establishing a unified and robust tracking framework.

Motivation: 现有图Transformer（GTs）依赖特定交互的复杂架构设计，灵活性不足。

Method: 提出层次掩码框架，设计M3Dphormer模型，结合多级掩码和双注意力计算。

Result: M3Dphormer在多个基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: 统一框架和模型设计有效，层次掩码和双注意力计算显著提升性能。

Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for graph
representation learning due to their ability to model diverse node
interactions. However, existing GTs often rely on intricate architectural
designs tailored to specific interactions, limiting their flexibility. To
address this, we propose a unified hierarchical mask framework that reveals an
underlying equivalence between model architecture and attention mask
construction. This framework enables a consistent modeling paradigm by
capturing diverse interactions through carefully designed attention masks.
Theoretical analysis under this framework demonstrates that the probability of
correct classification positively correlates with the receptive field size and
label consistency, leading to a fundamental design principle: an effective
attention mask should ensure both a sufficiently large receptive field and a
high level of label consistency. While no single existing mask satisfies this
principle across all scenarios, our analysis reveals that hierarchical masks
offer complementary strengths, motivating their effective integration. Then, we
introduce M3Dphormer, a Mixture-of-Experts-based Graph Transformer with
Multi-Level Masking and Dual Attention Computation. M3Dphormer incorporates
three theoretically grounded hierarchical masks and employs a bi-level expert
routing mechanism to adaptively integrate multi-level interaction information.
To ensure scalability, we further introduce a dual attention computation scheme
that dynamically switches between dense and sparse modes based on local mask
sparsity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
M3Dphormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness
of our unified framework and model design.

Conclusion: FedDEAP通过创新设计显著提升了CLIP在多领域联邦学习中的性能，为联邦学习与大规模视觉语言模型的结合提供了新思路。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables multiple clients to collaboratively train
machine learning models without exposing local data, balancing performance and
privacy. However, domain shift and label heterogeneity across clients often
hinder the generalization of the aggregated global model. Recently, large-scale
vision-language models like CLIP have shown strong zero-shot classification
capabilities, raising the question of how to effectively fine-tune CLIP across
domains in a federated setting. In this work, we propose an adaptive federated
prompt tuning framework, FedDEAP, to enhance CLIP's generalization in
multi-domain scenarios. Our method includes the following three key components:
(1) To mitigate the loss of domain-specific information caused by
label-supervised tuning, we disentangle semantic and domain-specific features
in images by using semantic and domain transformation networks with unbiased
mappings; (2) To preserve domain-specific knowledge during global prompt
aggregation, we introduce a dual-prompt design with a global semantic prompt
and a local domain prompt to balance shared and personalized information; (3)
To maximize the inclusion of semantic and domain information from images in the
generated text features, we align textual and visual representations under the
two learned transformations to preserve semantic and domain consistency.
Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in enhancing the generalization of CLIP for
federated image recognition across multiple domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子词分词方法在处理低资源语言时效率低下，SeeTok旨在模拟人类视觉阅读方式，提升语言模型的自然性和效率。

Method: SeeTok将文本渲染为图像，利用预训练的多模态大语言模型（具备OCR和文本-视觉对齐能力）进行解读。

Result: 在三个语言任务中，SeeTok性能优于传统分词方法，减少了70.5%的计算量，并提升了跨语言泛化和抗噪能力。

Conclusion: SeeTok标志着从符号化分词向视觉阅读的转变，为更自然、认知启发的语言模型迈出了一步。

Abstract: People see text. Humans read by recognizing words as visual objects,
including their shapes, layouts, and patterns, before connecting them to
meaning, which enables us to handle typos, distorted fonts, and various scripts
effectively. Modern large language models (LLMs), however, rely on subword
tokenization, fragmenting text into pieces from a fixed vocabulary. While
effective for high-resource languages, this approach over-segments low-resource
languages, yielding long, linguistically meaningless sequences and inflating
computation. In this work, we challenge this entrenched paradigm and move
toward a vision-centric alternative. Our method, SeeTok, renders text as images
(visual-text) and leverages pretrained multimodal LLMs to interpret them,
reusing strong OCR and text-vision alignment abilities learned from large-scale
multimodal training. Across three different language tasks, SeeTok matches or
surpasses subword tokenizers while requiring 4.43 times fewer tokens and
reducing FLOPs by 70.5%, with additional gains in cross-lingual generalization,
robustness to typographic noise, and linguistic hierarchy. SeeTok signals a
shift from symbolic tokenization to human-like visual reading, and takes a step
toward more natural and cognitively inspired language models.

Motivation: 利用T2I扩散模型的随机性，通过优化感知偏好来提升真实图像超分辨率的性能。

Method: 构建混合奖励信号，结合全参考和无参考IQA模型，并采用分层偏好优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，DP$^2$O-SR在扩散和流式T2I骨干网络上均显著提升了感知质量。

Conclusion: DP$^2$O-SR是一种高效且稳定的方法，能够适应不同模型容量，并在真实世界基准测试中表现优异。

Abstract: Benefiting from pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, real-world
image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods can synthesize rich and realistic
details. However, due to the inherent stochasticity of T2I models, different
noise inputs often lead to outputs with varying perceptual quality. Although
this randomness is sometimes seen as a limitation, it also introduces a wider
perceptual quality range, which can be exploited to improve Real-ISR
performance. To this end, we introduce Direct Perceptual Preference
Optimization for Real-ISR (DP$^2$O-SR), a framework that aligns generative
models with perceptual preferences without requiring costly human annotations.
We construct a hybrid reward signal by combining full-reference and
no-reference image quality assessment (IQA) models trained on large-scale human
preference datasets. This reward encourages both structural fidelity and
natural appearance. To better utilize perceptual diversity, we move beyond the
standard best-vs-worst selection and construct multiple preference pairs from
outputs of the same model. Our analysis reveals that the optimal selection
ratio depends on model capacity: smaller models benefit from broader coverage,
while larger models respond better to stronger contrast in supervision.
Furthermore, we propose hierarchical preference optimization, which adaptively
weights training pairs based on intra-group reward gaps and inter-group
diversity, enabling more efficient and stable learning. Extensive experiments
across both diffusion- and flow-based T2I backbones demonstrate that DP$^2$O-SR
significantly improves perceptual quality and generalizes well to real-world
benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型和视觉专家模型在2D任务和静态场景中表现优异，但在动态3D场景中的理解能力有限。

Method: 通过设计空间和时间对称的基准（DSI-Bench），系统评估模型对观察者和物体运动的推理能力。

Result: 评估14个模型后发现，模型常混淆观察者和物体运动，存在语义偏差，且难以准确推断动态场景中的相对关系。

Conclusion: DSI-Bench为未来开发具有动态空间智能的通用和专家模型提供了有价值的发现和见解。

Abstract: Reasoning about dynamic spatial relationships is essential, as both observers
and objects often move simultaneously. Although vision-language models (VLMs)
and visual expertise models excel in 2D tasks and static scenarios, their
ability to fully understand dynamic 3D scenarios remains limited. We introduce
Dynamic Spatial Intelligence and propose DSI-Bench, a benchmark with nearly
1,000 dynamic videos and over 1,700 manually annotated questions covering nine
decoupled motion patterns of observers and objects. Spatially and temporally
symmetric designs reduce biases and enable systematic evaluation of models'
reasoning about self-motion and object motion. Our evaluation of 14 VLMs and
expert models reveals key limitations: models often conflate observer and
object motion, exhibit semantic biases, and fail to accurately infer relative
relationships in dynamic scenarios. Our DSI-Bench provides valuable findings
and insights about the future development of general and expertise models with
dynamic spatial intelligence.

Result: GAR在多个基准测试中表现优异，甚至超越更大模型，并展示出强大的跨模态迁移能力。

Conclusion: GAR通过主动对话和组合推理，显著提升了区域级视觉理解能力。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at holistic
understanding, they struggle in capturing the dense world with complex scenes,
requiring fine-grained analysis of intricate details and object
inter-relationships. Region-level MLLMs have been a promising step. However,
previous attempts are generally optimized to understand given regions in
isolation, neglecting crucial global contexts. To address this, we introduce
Grasp Any Region (GAR) for comprehen- sive region-level visual understanding.
Empowered by an effective RoI-aligned feature replay technique, GAR supports
(1) precise perception by leveraging necessary global contexts, and (2)
modeling interactions between multiple prompts. Together, it then naturally
achieves (3) advanced compositional reasoning to answer specific free-form
questions about any region, shifting the paradigm from passive description to
active dialogue. Moreover, we construct GAR-Bench, which not only provides a
more accurate evaluation of single-region comprehension, but also, more
importantly, measures interactions and complex reasoning across multiple
regions. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GAR-1B not only maintains
the state-of-the-art captioning capabilities, e.g., outperforming DAM-3B +4.5
on DLC-Bench, but also excels at modeling relationships between multiple
prompts with advanced comprehension capabilities, even surpassing InternVL3-78B
on GAR-Bench-VQA. More importantly, our zero-shot GAR-8B even outperforms
in-domain VideoRefer-7B on VideoRefer-BenchQ, indicating its strong
capabilities can be easily transferred to videos.

Result: 在ToolBench基准测试中，Pass Rate、Recall和NDCG等指标均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于执行的验证比单纯语义相似性更可靠，能提升代理在现实应用中的性能。

Abstract: Despite remarkable advances in Large Language Model capabilities, tool
retrieval for agent-based systems remains fundamentally limited by reliance on
semantic similarity, which fails to capture functional viability. Current
methods often retrieve textually relevant but functionally inoperative tools
due to parameter mismatches, authentication failures, and execution
constraints--a phenomenon we term the semantic-functional gap. We introduce
GRETEL, to address this gap through systematic empirical validation. GRETEL
implements an agentic workflow that processes semantically retrieved candidates
through sandboxed plan-execute-evaluate cycles, generating execution-grounded
evidence to distinguish truly functional tools from merely descriptive matches.
Our comprehensive evaluation on the ToolBench benchmark demonstrates
substantial improvements across all metrics: Pass Rate (at 10) increases from
0.690 to 0.826, Recall (at 10) improves from 0.841 to 0.867, and NDCG (at 10)
rises from 0.807 to 0.857.. These results establish that execution-based
validation provides a more reliable foundation for tool selection than semantic
similarity alone, enabling more robust agent performance in real-world
applications.

Result: 在XJTU-SY和PRONOSTIA数据集上，CARLE优于多种先进方法，尤其在动态条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: CARLE通过模型可解释性分析（LIME和SHAP）验证了其透明性和可信度。

Abstract: Prognostic Health Management (PHM) systems monitor and predict equipment
health. A key task is Remaining Useful Life (RUL) estimation, which predicts
how long a component, such as a rolling element bearing, will operate before
failure. Many RUL methods exist but often lack generalizability and robustness
under changing operating conditions. This paper introduces CARLE, a hybrid AI
framework that combines deep and shallow learning to address these challenges.
CARLE uses Res-CNN and Res-LSTM blocks with multi-head attention and residual
connections to capture spatial and temporal degradation patterns, and a Random
Forest Regressor (RFR) for stable, accurate RUL prediction. A compact
preprocessing pipeline applies Gaussian filtering for noise reduction and
Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for time-frequency feature extraction. We
evaluate CARLE on the XJTU-SY and PRONOSTIA bearing datasets. Ablation studies
measure each component's contribution, while noise and cross-domain experiments
test robustness and generalization. Comparative results show CARLE outperforms
several state-of-the-art methods, especially under dynamic conditions. Finally,
we analyze model interpretability with LIME and SHAP to assess transparency and
trustworthiness.

Result: 在CV和NLP基准测试中，MIN-Merging在领域内任务上表现优异，同时保持预训练模型在领域外任务上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MIN-Merging是解决模型合并中参数冲突问题的有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to a surge of open-source models
across diverse domains. While model merging offers a promising way to combine
their strengths, existing approaches often suffer from parameter conflicts that
degrade performance on domain-specific tasks. We propose MIN-Merging, a
router-based framework that selectively merges the most important neurons to
reduce such conflicts. Extensive experiments on Computer Vision(CV) and Natural
Language Processing(NLP) benchmarks show that MIN-Merging achieves consistent
gains on in-domain tasks while retaining the generalization ability of
pretrained models on out-of-domain tasks. These results highlight its
effectiveness as a practical solution to the parameter conflict problem in
model merging.

TL;DR: 提出了一种联邦遗忘方法，用于大规模语言模型（LLMs），解决连续异构遗忘需求和分散敏感数据的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在现实应用中引发隐私和安全问题，需要移除不良知识，但现有遗忘方法面临连续异构需求和分散敏感数据的挑战。

Method: 通过任务特定适配器学习和分层合并策略，解耦遗忘与保留，减少目标冲突，实现稳健的遗忘更新。

Result: 在WMDP、MUSE和TOFU基准测试中，该方法有效处理异构遗忘请求，同时保持LLM的高效性。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLMs提供了一种可扩展且隐私保护的联邦遗忘解决方案，优于基线方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into real-world
applications, raising concerns about privacy, security and the need to remove
undesirable knowledge. Machine Unlearning has emerged as a promising solution,
yet faces two key challenges: (1) practical unlearning needs are often
continuous and heterogeneous, and (2) they involve decentralized, sensitive
data with asymmetric access. These factors result in inter-domain and
intra-domain interference, which further amplifies the dilemma of unbalanced
forgetting and retaining performance. In response, we propose a federated
unlearning approach for LLMs that is scalable and privacy preserving. Our
method decouples unlearning and retention via task-specific adapter learning
and employs a hierarchical merging strategy to mitigate conflicting objectives
and enables robust, adaptable unlearning updates. Comprehensive experiments on
benchmarks of WMDP, MUSE, and TOFU showed that our approach effectively handles
heterogeneous unlearning requests while maintaining strong LLM utility compared
with baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出一个统一的基准测试，用于评估注意力机制在长上下文LLM训练中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制在长上下文训练中计算和内存成本高，现有研究缺乏系统性评估。

Method: 集成代表性注意力核和上下文并行机制，通过模块化接口评估。

Result: 在96个GPU集群上进行了全面实验，提供了可复现的比较和实用指导。

Conclusion: 基准测试揭示了方法特定的权衡，为长上下文LLM训练提供了设计指导。

Abstract: Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
success, yet their standard attention mechanism incurs quadratic computation
and memory costs with respect to sequence length, posing a major bottleneck for
long-context training. Prior work tackles this challenge along two directions:
(1) kernel-level optimizations, which accelerate dense and sparse attention
operators; and (2) module-level strategies, often referred to as distributed
attention or context parallel training, which scale attention across multiple
devices. However, systematic evaluation still remains limited: operator-level
comparisons are often incomplete, while context parallel strategies are
typically framework-specific, with unclear performance analysis across
contexts. To address these gaps, we propose a unified benchmark that integrates
representative attention kernels and context parallel mechanisms with a modular
and extensible interface for evaluation. The benchmark evaluates methods along
two critical dimensions: (1) attention mask patterns, which strongly affect
efficiency, scalability, and usability, and (2) sequence length and distributed
scale, which determine performance under extreme long-context training. Through
comprehensive experiments on the cluster of up to 96 GPUs, our benchmark
enables reproducible comparisons, highlights method-specific trade-offs, and
provides practical guidance for designing and deploying attention mechanisms in
long-context LLM training.

TL;DR: L-MoE结合了MoE和LoRA，提出了一种轻量级、参数高效的专家混合框架，支持动态技能组合和端到端训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合MoE的稀疏激活和LoRA的参数高效微调，构建更高效、可扩展和专门化的语言模型。

Method: 将MoE专家定义为低秩适配器集合，通过轻量级门控网络动态组合这些适配器，实现端到端训练。

Result: 提出了L-MoE框架，支持参数高效、模块化设计和动态技能组合。

Conclusion: L-MoE为构建高效、可扩展和专门化的语言模型提供了新路径。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture enables the scaling of Large
Language Models (LLMs) to trillions of parameters by activating a sparse subset
of weights for each input, maintaining constant computational cost during
inference. Concurrently, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a dominant
technique for parameter-efficiently fine-tuning LLMs on specialized tasks. In
this work, we unify these two paradigms into a novel, end-to-end trainable
framework named L-MoE: a Lightweight Mixture of LoRA Experts. L-MoE redefines
MoE experts not as dense feed-forward networks, but as a collection of
task-specialized, low-rank adapters. A lightweight gating network, trained
jointly with the experts, learns to dynamically compose these LoRA adapters by
computing a weighted average of their parameters for each input token. This
composition is fully differentiable, allowing gradients from a standard
auto-regressive language modeling objective to flow back through the entire
architecture, simultaneously refining both the expert adapters and the routing
strategy. This approach creates a highly parameter-efficient MoE model that is
modular by design, allows for dynamic skill composition, and is trainable from
end-to-end. We present the formal mathematical framework for L-MoE, detailing
the differentiable routing mechanism and the joint optimization objective,
thereby providing a new path toward building more efficient, scalable, and
specialized language models.

TL;DR: 利用大型语言模型（LLM）自动生成针对自动调优问题的优化算法，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动调优方法依赖固定优化算法，但无法在所有任务中表现最佳，因此探索LLM生成定制化优化算法的潜力。

Method: 提出一个框架，通过向LLM提供问题描述和搜索空间特征，生成并迭代改进优化策略。

Result: 在多个硬件平台上评估，LLM生成的算法平均性能提升30.7%和14.6%，最佳算法平均提升72.4%。

Conclusion: LLM生成的优化算法能媲美甚至超越人工设计的算法，为自动调优提供新方向。

Abstract: Automatic performance tuning (auto-tuning) is essential for optimizing
high-performance applications, where vast and irregular parameter spaces make
manual exploration infeasible. Traditionally, auto-tuning relies on
well-established optimization algorithms such as evolutionary algorithms,
annealing methods, or surrogate model-based optimizers to efficiently find
near-optimal configurations. However, designing effective optimizers remains
challenging, as no single method performs best across all tuning tasks.
  In this work, we explore a new paradigm: using large language models (LLMs)
to automatically generate optimization algorithms tailored to auto-tuning
problems. We introduce a framework that prompts LLMs with problem descriptions
and search-space characteristics results to produce specialized optimization
strategies, which are iteratively examined and improved.
  These generated algorithms are evaluated on four real-world auto-tuning
applications across six hardware platforms and compared against the
state-of-the-art in optimization algorithms of two contemporary auto-tuning
frameworks. The evaluation demonstrates that providing additional application-
and search space-specific information in the generation stage results in an
average performance improvement of 30.7\% and 14.6\%, respectively. In
addition, our results show that LLM-generated optimizers can rival, and in
various cases outperform, existing human-designed algorithms, with our
best-performing generated optimization algorithms achieving, on average, 72.4\%
improvement over state-of-the-art optimizers for auto-tuning.

TL;DR: SBVFL是一种新型的垂直联邦学习范式，通过减少节点与服务器之间的通信，显著提升了隐私和安全性，同时保持了模型的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习（VFL）在训练过程中需要大量通信，这可能导致隐私泄露、高能耗甚至训练不可行。SBVFL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: SBVFL采用分布式训练机制，将大部分节点更新与服务器解耦，从而大幅减少通信次数。

Result: 实验表明，SBVFL比标准VFL减少了约99%的通信，同时保持了模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SBVFL为敏感领域（如医疗、金融等）提供了一种实用且隐私保护的垂直联邦学习解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative decentralized training across
multiple parties (nodes) while keeping raw data private. There are two main
paradigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the
same feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where
participants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is
widely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary
features about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:
the vast number of communications required during training. This compromises
privacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some
cases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.
  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning
(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism
enhanced for privacy and security. Decoupling the vast majority of node updates
from the server dramatically reduces node-server communication. Experiments
show that SBVFL reduces communication by ~99% compared to standard VFL while
maintaining accuracy and robustness. Therefore, SBVFL enables practical,
privacy-preserving VFL across sensitive domains, including healthcare, finance,
manufacturing, aerospace, cybersecurity, and the defense industry.

a scoring system that balances accuracy and stability. To support
reproducibility, we release SSL4EO-S12-downstream, a curated multispectral,
multitemporal EO dataset. We present initial results from a public challenge at
the 2025 CVPR EARTHVISION workshop and conduct ablations with state-of-the-art
foundation models. NeuCo-Bench provides a first step towards community-driven,
standardized evaluation of neural embeddings for EO and beyond.

Motivation: 现有方法通常对所有预测进行全局转换，忽略了预测的异质性可靠性，且校准改进与不确定性感知决策之间的关系尚未充分探索。

Method: 框架基于邻近性共形预测将校准样本分为正确和错误组，采用双重校准策略：标准等渗回归校准正确预测的置信度，而欠置信正则化等渗回归降低错误预测的置信度。

Conclusion: 该工作通过实例级适应性桥接了校准和不确定性量化，提供了一种无需模型重训练的后处理解决方案。

Abstract: Despite extensive research on neural network calibration, existing methods
typically apply global transformations that treat all predictions uniformly,
overlooking the heterogeneous reliability of individual predictions.
Furthermore, the relationship between improved calibration and effective
uncertainty-aware decision-making remains largely unexplored. This paper
presents a post-hoc calibration framework that leverages prediction reliability
assessment to jointly enhance calibration quality and uncertainty-aware
decision-making. The framework employs proximity-based conformal prediction to
stratify calibration samples into putatively correct and putatively incorrect
groups based on semantic similarity in feature space. A dual calibration
strategy is then applied: standard isotonic regression calibrated confidence in
putatively correct predictions, while underconfidence-regularized isotonic
regression reduces confidence toward uniform distributions for putatively
incorrect predictions, facilitating their identification for further
investigations. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted using calibration
metrics, uncertainty-aware performance measures, and empirical conformal
coverage. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 with BiT and CoAtNet backbones
show that the proposed method achieves lower confidently incorrect predictions,
and competitive Expected Calibration Error compared with isotonic and
focal-loss baselines. This work bridges calibration and uncertainty
quantification through instance-level adaptivity, offering a practical post-hoc
solution that requires no model retraining while improving both probability
alignment and uncertainty-aware decision-making.

Result: 在图像级和文本到图像任务中，生成质量更高，噪声更低。

Conclusion: 通过时间-频率选择性方法，解决了扩散模型数据遗忘的独特挑战，提升了评估和遗忘性能。

Abstract: Data unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples
from a trained model without requiring full retraining. Unlike concept
unlearning, data unlearning in diffusion models remains underexplored and often
suffers from quality degradation or incomplete forgetting. To address this, we
first observe that most existing methods attempt to unlearn the samples at all
diffusion time steps equally, leading to poor-quality generation. We argue that
forgetting occurs disproportionately across time and frequency, depending on
the model and scenarios. By selectively focusing on specific time-frequency
ranges during training, we achieve samples with higher aesthetic quality and
lower noise. We validate this improvement by applying our time-frequency
selective approach to diverse settings, including gradient-based and preference
optimization objectives, as well as both image-level and text-to-image tasks.
Finally, to evaluate both deletion and quality of unlearned data samples, we
propose a simple normalized version of SSCD. Together, our analysis and methods
establish a clearer understanding of the unique challenges in data unlearning
for diffusion models, providing practical strategies to improve both evaluation
and unlearning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL方法依赖人工标注数据，存在可扩展性瓶颈，COMPASS旨在解决这一问题。

Method: COMPASS结合双校准答案奖励（DCAR）和决定性路径奖励（DPR），无需外部监督即可优化模型推理过程。

Result: 实验表明COMPASS在多种推理任务和模型架构中显著提升性能。

Conclusion: COMPASS为LLM从连续经验中学习提供了更可扩展的方向。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for advancing
Large Language Models (LLMs), achieving remarkable performance in complex
reasoning domains such as mathematics and code generation. However, current RL
methods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance
on human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To
overcome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn
autonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this
setting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.
Existing approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent
consensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority
voting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel
test-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision. COMPASS
integrates two complementary components: the Dual-Calibration Answer Reward
(DCAR), which stabilizes training by establishing trustworthy pseudo-labels
through confidence and credibility calibration, and the Decisive Path Reward
(DPR), which directly optimizes the reasoning process quality beyond mere
outcome supervision. By jointly reinforcing trustworthy consensus answers and
highly decisive reasoning chains, the COMPASS systematically enhances the
model's analytical capabilities. Extensive experiments show that COMPASS
achieves significant and consistent performance gains across diverse reasoning
tasks and model architectures, advancing a more scalable direction for LLMs to
learn from continuous experience.

Result: 在LiveCodeBench和AgentBench-OS任务上表现出显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成高质量的可验证数据，具有强大的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reliable verifiable data has become a key driver of capability gains in
modern language models, enabling stable reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards and effective distillation that transfers competence across math,
coding, and agentic tasks. Yet constructing generalizable synthetic verifiable
data remains difficult due to hallucination-prone generation, and weak or
trivial verification artifacts that fail to separate strong from weak
solutions. Existing approaches often rely on task-specific heuristics or
post-hoc filters that do not transfer across domains and lack a principled,
universal evaluator of verifiability. In this work, we introduce an
evolutionary, task-agnostic, strategy-guided, executably-checkable data
synthesis framework that, from minimal seed supervision, jointly synthesizes
problems, diverse candidate solutions, and verification artifacts, and
iteratively discovers strategies via a consistency-based evaluator that
enforces agreement between human-annotated and strategy-induced checks. This
pipeline upgrades filtering into principled synthesis: it reliably assembles
coherent, verifiable training instances and generalizes without domain-specific
rules. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach
under both RLVR and model distillation training paradigms. The results show
that training with our synthesized data yields significant improvements on both
the LiveCodeBench and AgentBench-OS tasks, highlighting the robust
generalization of our framework.

Result: 在Lorenz-63模型中，Param-CPD在F1分数、定位误差和假阳性率上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 参数空间提供了更清晰、可解释的变点检测信号，适用于非线性动力系统。

Abstract: Detecting regime shifts in chaotic time series is hard because
observation-space signals are entangled with intrinsic variability. We propose
Parameter--Space Changepoint Detection (Param--CPD), a two--stage framework
that first amortizes Bayesian inference of governing parameters with a neural
posterior estimator trained by simulation-based inference, and then applies a
standard CPD algorithm to the resulting parameter trajectory. On Lorenz--63
with piecewise-constant parameters, Param--CPD improves F1, reduces
localization error, and lowers false positives compared to observation--space
baselines. We further verify identifiability and calibration of the inferred
posteriors on stationary trajectories, explaining why parameter space offers a
cleaner detection signal. Robustness analyses over tolerance, window length,
and noise indicate consistent gains. Our results show that operating in a
physically interpretable parameter space enables accurate and interpretable
changepoint detection in nonlinear dynamical systems.

Motivation: 研究TM何时以及为何优于FM，特别是在单峰高斯和高斯混合分布中。

Method: 理论分析TM和FM在单峰高斯和高斯混合分布中的性能差异，并通过实验验证。

Result: TM在单峰高斯分布中KL散度更低，收敛更快；在高斯混合分布中，当模式分离明显时TM表现更优。

Conclusion: TM在目标分布模式分离明显且方差非零时优于FM，但在方差趋近零时优势减弱。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) underpins many state-of-the-art generative models, yet
recent results indicate that Transition Matching (TM) can achieve higher
quality with fewer sampling steps. This work answers the question of when and
why TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian
distribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for
finite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference
latent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM
underestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM
achieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing
its advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis
to Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the
sampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.
The approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component
means increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well
separated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update
converges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes. In
summary, we show that TM outperforms FM when the target distribution has
well-separated modes and non-negligible variances. We validate our theoretical
results with controlled experiments on Gaussian distributions, and extend the
comparison to real-world applications in image and video generation.

Result: 在三个真实世界多变量时空数据集上，A-DATSC表现优于现有深度子空间聚类模型。

Conclusion: A-DATSC通过注意力机制和对抗训练解决了现有方法的局限性，提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: Deep subspace clustering models are vital for applications such as snowmelt
detection, sea ice tracking, crop health monitoring, infectious disease
modeling, network load prediction, and land-use planning, where multivariate
spatiotemporal data exhibit complex temporal dependencies and reside on
multiple nonlinear manifolds beyond the capability of traditional clustering
methods. These models project data into a latent space where samples lie in
linear subspaces and exploit the self-expressiveness property to uncover
intrinsic relationships. Despite their success, existing methods face major
limitations: they use shallow autoencoders that ignore clustering errors,
emphasize global features while neglecting local structure, fail to model
long-range dependencies and positional information, and are rarely applied to
4D spatiotemporal data. To address these issues, we propose A-DATSC
(Attention-Guided Deep Adversarial Temporal Subspace Clustering), a model
combining a deep subspace clustering generator and a quality-verifying
discriminator. The generator, inspired by U-Net, preserves spatial and temporal
integrity through stacked TimeDistributed ConvLSTM2D layers, reducing
parameters and enhancing generalization. A graph attention transformer based
self-expressive network captures local spatial relationships, global
dependencies, and both short- and long-range correlations. Experiments on three
real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets show that A-DATSC achieves
substantially superior clustering performance compared to state-of-the-art deep
subspace clustering models.

Abstract: Neural activity forecasting is central to understanding neural systems and
enabling closed-loop control. While deep learning has recently advanced the
state-of-the-art in the time series forecasting literature, its application to
neural activity forecasting remains limited. To bridge this gap, we
systematically evaluated eight probabilistic deep learning models, including
two foundation models, that have demonstrated strong performance on general
forecasting benchmarks. We compared them against four classical statistical
models and two baseline methods on spontaneous neural activity recorded from
mouse cortex via widefield imaging. Across prediction horizons, several deep
learning models consistently outperformed classical approaches, with the best
model producing informative forecasts up to 1.5 seconds into the future. Our
findings point toward future control applications and open new avenues for
probing the intrinsic temporal structure of neural activity.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖密集、同域的输入输出场和短时间上下文，无法处理真实世界中传感和预测发生在不同物理流形和长时间尺度的问题。

Method: STONe通过直接推断高海拔辐射剂量场与稀疏地面中子测量之间的非线性算子，实现了跨域稳定预测。

Conclusion: STONe挑战了算子学习需要域对齐或自回归传播的传统观点，为跨域算子推断提供了通用框架。

Abstract: Forecasting unobservable physical quantities from sparse, cross-domain sensor
data is a central unsolved problem in scientific machine learning. Existing
neural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located
input-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in
real-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical
manifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator
Network (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable
functional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring
high-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron
measurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond
shared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and
target manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without
iterative recurrence. This challenges the conventional view that operator
learning requires domain alignment or autoregressive propagation. Trained on 23
years of global neutron data, STONe achieves accurate 180-day forecasts with
millisecond inference latency. The framework establishes a general principle
for cross-domain operator inference, enabling real-time prediction of complex
spatiotemporal fields in physics, climate, and energy systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ACIA的新框架，用于反因果表示学习，通过两级设计解决现有方法的局限性，并在实验中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反因果设置中的表示学习面临独特挑战，需要专门的方法来解决。

Method: ACIA采用两级设计，低层表示捕捉标签如何生成观测，高层表示学习跨环境的稳定因果模式。

Result: 在合成和真实医学数据集上，ACIA在准确性和不变性指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ACIA通过理论保证和实验验证，证明了其在反因果学习中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Abstract: Causal representation learning in the anti-causal setting (labels cause
features rather than the reverse) presents unique challenges requiring
specialized approaches. We propose Anti-Causal Invariant Abstractions (ACIA), a
novel measure-theoretic framework for anti-causal representation learning. ACIA
employs a two-level design, low-level representations capture how labels
generate observations, while high-level representations learn stable causal
patterns across environment-specific variations. ACIA addresses key limitations
of existing approaches by accommodating prefect and imperfect interventions
through interventional kernels, eliminating dependency on explicit causal
structures, handling high-dimensional data effectively, and providing
theoretical guarantees for out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments on
synthetic and real-world medical datasets demonstrate that ACIA consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and invariance metrics.
Furthermore, our theoretical results establish tight bounds on performance gaps
between training and unseen environments, confirming the efficacy of our
approach for robust anti-causal learning.

TL;DR: ADRPO通过自适应调整正则化强度，平衡探索与利用，提升生成模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定正则化，导致探索与利用的权衡问题。

Method: 提出ADRPO，基于优势估计动态调整正则化强度。

Result: 在文本到图像生成和多模态推理中表现优异，超越更大模型。

Conclusion: ADRPO为生成模型提供了一种通用的探索-利用平衡解决方案。

Abstract: Balancing exploration and exploitation during reinforcement learning
fine-tuning of generative models presents a critical challenge, as existing
approaches rely on fixed divergence regularization that creates an inherent
dilemma: strong regularization preserves model capabilities but limits reward
optimization, while weak regularization enables greater alignment but risks
instability or reward hacking. We introduce Adaptive Divergence Regularized
Policy Optimization (ADRPO), which automatically adjusts regularization
strength based on advantage estimates-reducing regularization for high-value
samples while applying stronger regularization to poor samples, enabling
policies to navigate between exploration and aggressive exploitation according
to data quality. Our implementation with Wasserstein-2 regularization for flow
matching generative models achieves remarkable results on text-to-image
generation, achieving better semantic alignment and diversity than offline
methods like DPO and online methods with fixed regularization like ORW-CFM-W2.
ADRPO enables a 2B parameter SD3 model to surpass much larger models with 4.8B
and 12B parameters in attribute binding, semantic consistency, artistic style
transfer, and compositional control while maintaining generation diversity.
ADRPO generalizes to KL-regularized fine-tuning of both text-only LLMs and
multi-modal reasoning models, enhancing existing online RL methods like GRPO.
In LLM fine-tuning, ADRPO demonstrates an emergent ability to escape local
optima through active exploration, while in multi-modal audio reasoning, it
outperforms GRPO through superior step-by-step reasoning, enabling a 7B model
to outperform substantially larger commercial models including Gemini 2.5 Pro
and GPT-4o Audio, offering an effective plug-and-play solution to the
exploration-exploitation challenge across diverse generative architectures and
modalities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动驾驶车辆需要安全、高效且接近人类行为的模拟策略，现有方法在计算成本或行为真实性上存在不足。

Method: 利用预训练的标记化自回归运动模型作为中心参考策略，指导分散的自强化学习，结合似然奖励和KL散度。

Result: 在Waymo模拟代理挑战中表现优异，推理速度快10倍，参数规模小50倍，同时保持行为真实性。

Conclusion: SPACeR为自动驾驶策略测试提供了快速、可扩展且接近人类行为的新范式。

Abstract: Developing autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires not only safety and efficiency,
but also realistic, human-like behaviors that are socially aware and
predictable. Achieving this requires sim agent policies that are human-like,
fast, and scalable in multi-agent settings. Recent progress in imitation
learning with large diffusion-based or tokenized models has shown that
behaviors can be captured directly from human driving data, producing realistic
policies. However, these models are computationally expensive, slow during
inference, and struggle to adapt in reactive, closed-loop scenarios. In
contrast, self-play reinforcement learning (RL) scales efficiently and
naturally captures multi-agent interactions, but it often relies on heuristics
and reward shaping, and the resulting policies can diverge from human norms. We
propose SPACeR, a framework that leverages a pretrained tokenized
autoregressive motion model as a centralized reference policy to guide
decentralized self-play. The reference model provides likelihood rewards and KL
divergence, anchoring policies to the human driving distribution while
preserving RL scalability. Evaluated on the Waymo Sim Agents Challenge, our
method achieves competitive performance with imitation-learned policies while
being up to 10x faster at inference and 50x smaller in parameter size than
large generative models. In addition, we demonstrate in closed-loop ego
planning evaluation tasks that our sim agents can effectively measure planner
quality with fast and scalable traffic simulation, establishing a new paradigm
for testing autonomous driving policies.

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 3上的实验表明，AC-Flow在文本到图像对齐任务和泛化能力上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AC-Flow能够高效微调流模型，同时保持生成质量、多样性和稳定性。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have shown remarkable success in text-to-image
generation, yet fine-tuning them with intermediate feedback remains
challenging, especially for continuous-time flow matching models. Most existing
approaches solely learn from outcome rewards, struggling with the credit
assignment problem. Alternative methods that attempt to learn a critic via
direct regression on cumulative rewards often face training instabilities and
model collapse in online settings. We present AC-Flow, a robust actor-critic
framework that addresses these challenges through three key innovations: (1)
reward shaping that provides well-normalized learning signals to enable stable
intermediate value learning and gradient control, (2) a novel dual-stability
mechanism that combines advantage clipping to prevent destructive policy
updates with a warm-up phase that allows the critic to mature before
influencing the actor, and (3) a scalable generalized critic weighting scheme
that extends traditional reward-weighted methods while preserving model
diversity through Wasserstein regularization. Through extensive experiments on
Stable Diffusion 3, we demonstrate that AC-Flow achieves state-of-the-art
performance in text-to-image alignment tasks and generalization to unseen human
preference models. Our results demonstrate that even with a computationally
efficient critic model, we can robustly finetune flow models without
compromising generative quality, diversity, or stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多实际应用（如路由、资源分配）不仅需要高平均性能，还需要成功概率的保证。

Method: 通过状态增强表示将可靠RL问题转化为标准RL问题，利用现有算法（如Q-learning）求解。

Result: 理论证明了两者的等价性，实验验证了方法在可靠路由问题中的有效性。

Conclusion: 可靠RL能在随机和安全关键环境中平衡效率与可靠性。

Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of determining reliable policies in
reinforcement learning (RL), with a focus on optimization under uncertainty and
the need for performance guarantees. While classical RL algorithms aim at
maximizing the expected return, many real-world applications - such as routing,
resource allocation, or sequential decision-making under risk - require
strategies that ensure not only high average performance but also a guaranteed
probability of success. To this end, we propose a novel formulation in which
the objective is to maximize the probability that the cumulative return exceeds
a prescribed threshold. We demonstrate that this reliable RL problem can be
reformulated, via a state-augmented representation, into a standard RL problem,
thereby allowing the use of existing RL and deep RL algorithms without the need
for entirely new algorithmic frameworks. Theoretical results establish the
equivalence of the two formulations and show that reliable strategies can be
derived by appropriately adapting well-known methods such as Q-learning or
Dueling Double DQN. To illustrate the practical relevance of the approach, we
consider the problem of reliable routing, where the goal is not to minimize the
expected travel time but rather to maximize the probability of reaching the
destination within a given time budget. Numerical experiments confirm that the
proposed formulation leads to policies that effectively balance efficiency and
reliability, highlighting the potential of reliable RL for applications in
stochastic and safety-critical environments.

Conclusion: 新数据库为开发先进的基于机器学习的异常检测方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) holds great potential to advance anomaly detection (AD)
in chemical processes. However, the development of ML-based methods is hindered
by the lack of openly available experimental data. To address this gap, we have
set up a laboratory-scale batch distillation plant and operated it to generate
an extensive experimental database, covering fault-free experiments and
experiments in which anomalies were intentionally induced, for training
advanced ML-based AD methods. In total, 119 experiments were conducted across a
wide range of operating conditions and mixtures. Most experiments containing
anomalies were paired with a corresponding fault-free one. The database that we
provide here includes time-series data from numerous sensors and actuators,
along with estimates of measurement uncertainty. In addition, unconventional
data sources -- such as concentration profiles obtained via online benchtop NMR
spectroscopy and video and audio recordings -- are provided. Extensive metadata
and expert annotations of all experiments are included. The anomaly annotations
are based on an ontology developed in this work. The data are organized in a
structured database and made freely available via
doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17395544. This new database paves the way for the
development of advanced ML-based AD methods. As it includes information on the
causes of anomalies, it further enables the development of interpretable and
explainable ML approaches, as well as methods for anomaly mitigation.

Abstract: Modelling the complex spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain dynamics
is crucial for neuroscience, but traditional methods fail to capture the rich
structure in modalities such as magnetoencephalography (MEG). Recent advances
in deep learning have enabled significant progress in other domains, such as
language and vision, by using foundation models at scale. Here, we introduce
MEG-GPT, a transformer based foundation model that uses time-attention and next
time-point prediction. To facilitate this, we also introduce a novel
data-driven tokeniser for continuous MEG data, which preserves the high
temporal resolution of continuous MEG signals without lossy transformations. We
trained MEG-GPT on tokenised brain region time-courses extracted from a
large-scale MEG dataset (N=612, eyes-closed rest, Cam-CAN data), and show that
the learnt model can generate data with realistic spatio-spectral properties,
including transient events and population variability. Critically, it performs
well in downstream decoding tasks, improving downstream supervised prediction
task, showing improved zero-shot generalisation across sessions (improving
accuracy from 0.54 to 0.59) and subjects (improving accuracy from 0.41 to 0.49)
compared to a baseline methods. Furthermore, we show the model can be
efficiently fine-tuned on a smaller labelled dataset to boost performance in
cross-subject decoding scenarios. This work establishes a powerful foundation
model for electrophysiological data, paving the way for applications in
computational neuroscience and neural decoding.

Result: 在Safety Gymnasium实验中，训练期间零违规，最终性能匹配或超过无过滤基线。

Conclusion: 安全过滤与性能优化可以完全分离，建议使用最宽松的安全过滤器进行训练和部署。

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) enable its use on increasingly
complex tasks, but the lack of formal safety guarantees still limits its
application in safety-critical settings. A common practical approach is to
augment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to
prevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering
is often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning
process. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not
inherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a
sufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.
We formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),
which requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of
catastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP
in which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is
considered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that
(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL
convergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is
optimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the
same asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a
complete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We
validate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and
constraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance
matching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light
on a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,
principled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most
permissive safety filter that is available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型的浅层对齐机制在生成过程中容易失效，导致安全性问题。研究旨在探索如何利用模型的固有对齐先验，确保生成过程中的持续安全性。

Method: 提出ADA方法，通过重新引入助手头部标记，触发模型重新评估有害性，从而恢复拒绝能力。该方法无需修改模型参数，适用于多种开源模型。

Result: ADA在多种对抗攻击场景下表现出色，拒绝率接近100%，并将主流对抗提示攻击的成功率降至3%以下，同时保持对良性任务的实用性。

Conclusion: ADA是一种高效且轻量的推理阶段防御方法，能够显著提升大语言模型的安全性，且对模型后续的指令微调具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong but shallow alignment: they
directly refuse harmful queries when a refusal is expected at the very start of
an assistant turn, yet this protection collapses once a harmful continuation is
underway (either through the adversarial attacks or via harmful
assistant-prefill attacks). This raises a fundamental question: Can the innate
shallow alignment in LLMs be unlocked to ensure safety at arbitrary generation
depths? To achieve this goal, we propose Any-Depth Alignment (ADA), an
effective inference-time defense with negligible overhead. ADA is built based
on our observation that alignment is concentrated in the assistant header
tokens through repeated use in shallow-refusal training, and these tokens
possess the model's strong alignment priors. By reintroducing these tokens
mid-stream, ADA induces the model to reassess harmfulness and recover refusals
at any point in generation. Across diverse open-source model families (Llama,
Gemma, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and gpt-oss), ADA achieves robust safety
performance without requiring any changes to the base model's parameters. It
secures a near-100% refusal rate against challenging adversarial prefill
attacks ranging from dozens to thousands of tokens. Furthermore, ADA reduces
the average success rate of prominent adversarial prompt attacks (such as GCG,
AutoDAN, PAIR, and TAP) to below 3%. This is all accomplished while preserving
utility on benign tasks with minimal over-refusal. ADA maintains this
resilience even after the base model undergoes subsequent instruction tuning
(benign or adversarial).

Abstract: Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units
(ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource
allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that
integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information,
specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV
database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a
multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both
models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings
significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression
model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918,
compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%.
The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net
benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the
clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic
value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into
interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients.

Result: 在无条件生成指标上优于现有掩码离散扩散基线，尤其在低采样预算下表现更佳。

Conclusion: LDDMs通过潜在通道增强跨令牌依赖，有效提升了生成质量。

Abstract: We study discrete diffusion for language and other categorical data and focus
on a common limitation of masked denoisers: reverse transitions typically
factorize across positions, which can weaken joint structure and degrade
quality in few-step generation. We propose \emph{Latent Discrete Diffusion
Models} (LDDMs), which couple a masked discrete diffusion over tokens with a
continuous diffusion over latent embeddings. The latent channel provides a
softer signal and carries cross-token dependencies that help resolve
ambiguities. We present two instantiations: (i) FUJI-LDDMs, which perform fully
joint denoising of tokens and latents, and (ii) SEQ-LDDMs, which sequentially
resolve the latent and then the discrete chain conditionally on it. For both
variants we derive ELBO-style objectives and discuss design choices to learn
informative latents yet amenable to diffusoin modeling. In experiments, LDDMs
yield improvements on unconditional generation metrics as compared to
state-of-the-art masked discrete diffusion baselines, and are effective at
lower sampling budgets, where unmasking many tokens per step is desirable.

Result: 确定性训练会导致记忆训练配对，而噪声注入能恢复模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Rectified Flows在确定性训练下存在记忆问题，噪声是恢复泛化的关键。

Abstract: Rectified Flows learn ODE vector fields whose trajectories are straight
between source and target distributions, enabling near one-step inference. We
show that this straight-path objective conceals fundamental failure modes:
under deterministic training, low gradient variance drives memorization of
arbitrary training pairings, even when interpolant lines between pairs
intersect. To analyze this mechanism, we study Gaussian-to-Gaussian transport
and use the loss gradient variance across stochastic and deterministic regimes
to characterize which vector fields optimization favors in each setting. We
then show that, in a setting where all interpolating lines intersect, applying
Rectified Flow yields the same specific pairings at inference as during
training. More generally, we prove that a memorizing vector field exists even
when training interpolants intersect, and that optimizing the straight-path
objective converges to this ill-defined field. At inference, deterministic
integration reproduces the exact training pairings. We validate our findings
empirically on the CelebA dataset, confirming that deterministic interpolants
induce memorization, while the injection of small noise restores
generalization.

Result: 在512 H200 GPU上，训练吞吐量提升1.35倍，消除了负载不均衡问题。

Conclusion: CAD通过分离和动态调度核心注意力计算，显著提高了长上下文训练的效率。

Abstract: We present core attention disaggregation (CAD), a technique that improves
long-context large language model training by decoupling the core attention
computation, softmax(QK^T)V, from the rest of the model and executing it on a
separate pool of devices. In existing systems, core attention is colocated with
other layers; at long context lengths, its quadratic compute growth compared to
the near-linear growth of other components causes load imbalance and stragglers
across data and pipeline parallel groups. CAD is enabled by two observations.
First, core attention is stateless: it has no trainable parameters and only
minimal transient data, so balancing reduces to scheduling compute-bound tasks.
Second, it is composable: modern attention kernels retain high efficiency when
processing fused batches of token-level shards with arbitrary lengths. CAD
partitions core attention into token-level tasks and dispatches them to
dedicated attention servers, which dynamically rebatch tasks to equalize
compute without sacrificing kernel efficiency. We implement CAD in a system
called DistCA, which uses a ping-pong execution scheme to fully overlap
communication with computation and in-place execution on attention servers to
reduce memory use. On 512 H200 GPUs and context lengths up to 512k tokens,
DistCA improves end-to-end training throughput by up to 1.35x, eliminates data
and pipeline parallel stragglers, and achieves near-perfect compute and memory
balance.

Abstract: We introduce HyperDiffusionFields (HyDiF), a framework that models 3D
molecular conformers as continuous fields rather than discrete atomic
coordinates or graphs. At the core of our approach is the Molecular Directional
Field (MDF), a vector field that maps any point in space to the direction of
the nearest atom of a particular type. We represent MDFs using
molecule-specific neural implicit fields, which we call Molecular Neural Fields
(MNFs). To enable learning across molecules and facilitate generalization, we
adopt an approach where a shared hypernetwork, conditioned on a molecule,
generates the weights of the given molecule's MNF. To endow the model with
generative capabilities, we train the hypernetwork as a denoising diffusion
model, enabling sampling in the function space of molecular fields. Our design
naturally extends to a masked diffusion mechanism to support
structure-conditioned generation tasks, such as molecular inpainting, by
selectively noising regions of the field. Beyond generation, the localized and
continuous nature of MDFs enables spatially fine-grained feature extraction for
molecular property prediction, something not easily achievable with graph or
point cloud based methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach scales
to larger biomolecules, illustrating a promising direction for field-based
molecular modeling.

Conclusion: 提出了鲁棒PCA的核化对偶形式，为经典方法提供优化视角。

Abstract: Motivated by the recently shown connection between self-attention and
(kernel) principal component analysis (PCA), we revisit the fundamentals of
PCA. Using the difference-of-convex (DC) framework, we present several novel
formulations and provide new theoretical insights. In particular, we show the
kernelizability and out-of-sample applicability for a PCA-like family of
problems. Moreover, we uncover that simultaneous iteration, which is connected
to the classical QR algorithm, is an instance of the difference-of-convex
algorithm (DCA), offering an optimization perspective on this longstanding
method. Further, we describe new algorithms for PCA and empirically compare
them with state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we introduce a kernelizable dual
formulation for a robust variant of PCA that minimizes the $l_1$ deviation of
the reconstruction errors.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种固定正则化强度的新方法，通过迭代优化参考策略来收敛到纳什均衡，避免了传统方法的不稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不完全信息博弈中纳什均衡求解的不稳定性问题，传统方法需要正则化强度趋近零，导致学习不稳定。

Method: 固定正则化强度，通过迭代优化参考策略，提出NashPG算法，结合策略梯度方法的通用性。

Result: 理论证明严格单调改进并收敛到纳什均衡，实验显示在经典博弈和大规模领域（如德州扑克）中表现优越。

Conclusion: NashPG算法在稳定性和性能上优于现有方法，适用于复杂博弈场景。

Abstract: Finding Nash equilibria in imperfect-information games remains a central
challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. While regularization-based
methods have recently achieved last-iteration convergence to a regularized
equilibrium, they require the regularization strength to shrink toward zero to
approximate a Nash equilibrium, often leading to unstable learning in practice.
Instead, we fix the regularization strength at a large value for robustness and
achieve convergence by iteratively refining the reference policy. Our main
theoretical result shows that this procedure guarantees strictly monotonic
improvement and convergence to an exact Nash equilibrium in two-player zero-sum
games, without requiring a uniqueness assumption. Building on this framework,
we develop a practical algorithm, Nash Policy Gradient (NashPG), which
preserves the generalizability of policy gradient methods while relying solely
on the current and reference policies. Empirically, NashPG achieves comparable
or lower exploitability than prior model-free methods on classic benchmark
games and scales to large domains such as Battleship and No-Limit Texas
Hold'em, where NashPG consistently attains higher Elo ratings.

TL;DR: ActivationReasoning (AR) 框架通过将逻辑推理嵌入LLM的潜在空间，提升透明度和控制能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM内部推理不透明且难以控制的问题，通过稀疏自编码器（SAEs）暴露潜在特征，但缺乏系统推理机制。

Method: AR分为三阶段：1) 识别潜在概念表示并组织成字典；2) 推理时检测激活概念并映射为逻辑命题；3) 应用逻辑规则推理高阶结构，控制模型行为。

Result: 在多项任务（如多跳推理、抽象任务、自然语言推理和安全性测试）中，AR表现出鲁棒性、泛化能力和跨模型迁移性。

Conclusion: AR通过潜在激活中的逻辑结构，不仅提升透明性，还支持结构化推理和可靠控制，为更可信和可审计的AI提供路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating fluent text, but their
internal reasoning remains opaque and difficult to control. Sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features
that often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and
passive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To
address this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds
explicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three
stages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept
representations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a
dictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects
activating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical
reasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order
structures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior. We evaluate AR on
multi-hop reasoning (PrOntoQA), abstraction and robustness to indirect concept
cues (Rail2Country), reasoning over natural and diverse language (ProverQA),
and context-sensitive safety (BeaverTails). Across all tasks, AR scales
robustly with reasoning complexity, generalizes to abstract and
context-sensitive tasks, and transfers across model backbones. These results
demonstrate that grounding logical structure in latent activations not only
improves transparency but also enables structured reasoning, reliable control,
and alignment with desired behaviors, providing a path toward more reliable and
auditable AI.

TL;DR: 提出一种多阶段集成框架，通过HJB方程学习最优成本函数和最优控制信号，避免传统PINN方法中的稳定项。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HJB方程的数值解计算复杂且解析解常不可得，需新方法解决。

Method: 采用多阶段集成框架，无需稳定项，通过HJB方程学习最优控制信号。

Result: 在闭环控制中成功应用于非线性系统，处理噪声和初始条件变化。

Conclusion: 框架有效，优于传统PINN方法，适用于复杂控制问题。

Abstract: The objective of designing a control system is to steer a dynamical system
with a control signal, guiding it to exhibit the desired behavior. The
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation offers a framework
for optimal control system design. However, numerical solutions to this
equation are computationally intensive, and analytical solutions are frequently
unavailable. Knowledge-guided machine learning methodologies, such as
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), offer new alternative approaches that
can alleviate the difficulties of solving the HJB equation numerically. This
work presents a multistage ensemble framework to learn the optimal cost-to-go,
and subsequently the corresponding optimal control signal, through the HJB
equation. Prior PINN-based approaches rely on a stabilizing the HJB enforcement
during training. Our framework does not use stabilizer terms and offers a means
of controlling the nonlinear system, via either a singular learned control
signal or an ensemble control signal policy. Success is demonstrated in
closed-loop control, using both ensemble- and singular-control, of a
steady-state time-invariant two-state continuous nonlinear system with an
infinite time horizon, accounting of noisy, perturbed system states and varying
initial conditions.

Abstract: This paper investigates underwater cooperative target detection using
autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), with a focus on the critical trade-off
between cooperation efficiency and communication covertness. To tackle this
challenge, we first formulate a joint trajectory and power control optimization
problem, and then present an innovative hierarchical action management
framework to solve it. According to the hierarchical formulation, at the macro
level, the master AUV models the agent selection process as a Markov decision
process and deploys the proximal policy optimization algorithm for strategic
task allocation. At the micro level, each selected agent's decentralized
decision-making is modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process,
and a multi-agent proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to dynamically
adjust its trajectory and transmission power based on its local observations.
Under the centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm, our target
detection framework enables adaptive covert cooperation while satisfying both
energy and mobility constraints. By comprehensively modeling the considered
system, the involved signals and tasks, as well as energy consumption,
theoretical insights and practical solutions for the efficient and secure
operation of multiple AUVs are provided, offering significant implications for
the execution of underwater covert communication tasks.

Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法在梯度估计中存在高方差问题，导致收敛慢且性能不佳。

Method: 提出P-GAP方法，估计低维梯度空间并沿投影梯度方向对齐扰动，减少扰动参数和方差。

Result: 实验显示P-GAP在分类和生成任务中分别提升6%和12%准确率，减少81%训练迭代和70%GPU时间。

Conclusion: P-GAP实现了快速、可扩展且资源高效的零阶LLM微调。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using zeroth-order (ZO) optimization
has emerged as a promising alternative to traditional gradient-based methods
due to its reduced memory footprint requirement. However, existing ZO methods
suffer from high variance in gradient estimation, leading to slow convergence
and suboptimal performance on large-scale models. In this work, we propose
P-GAP, a fast LLM fine-tuning approach through zeroth-order optimization with
Projected Gradient-Aligned Perturbations. Specifically, we first estimate a
low-dimensional gradient space and then align perturbations in projected
gradients' direction within the space. This approach enables reduced the number
of perturbed parameters and decreased variance, therefore accelerated
convergence for LLM fine-tuning. Experiments on LLMs show that P-GAP
consistently surpasses the baselines, achieving up to 6% increase in accuracy
on classification tasks and up to 12% higher accuracy on generation tasks, with
up to about 81% less training iterations and 70% less GPU hours. These results
demonstrate that P-GAP enables fast, scalable, and resource-efficient ZO LLM
fine-tuning.

Conclusion: ACTG-ARL算法显著提升了差分隐私合成文本的质量和控制能力，为语言模型的训练和评估提供了更优的隐私保护方案。

Abstract: Generating high-quality synthetic text under differential privacy (DP) is
critical for training and evaluating language models without compromising user
privacy. Prior work on synthesizing DP datasets often fail to preserve key
statistical attributes, suffer utility loss from the noise required by DP, and
lack fine-grained control over generation. To address these challenges, we make
two contributions. First, we introduce a hierarchical framework that decomposes
DP synthetic text generation into two subtasks: feature learning and
conditional text generation. This design explicitly incorporates learned
features into the generation process and simplifies the end-to-end synthesis
task. Through systematic ablations, we identify the most effective
configuration: a rich tabular schema as feature, a DP tabular synthesizer, and
a DP fine-tuned conditional generator, which we term ACTG
(Attribute-Conditioned Text Generation). Second, we propose Anchored RL (ARL),
a post-training method that improves the instruction-following ability of ACTG
for conditional generation. ARL combines RL to boost control with an SFT anchor
on best-of-$N$ data to prevent reward hacking. Together, these components form
our end-to-end algorithm ACTG-ARL, which advances both the quality of DP
synthetic text (+20% MAUVE over prior work) and the control of the conditional
generator under strong privacy guarantees.

Abstract: There has been increasing research interest in AI/ML for social impact, and
correspondingly more publication venues have refined review criteria for
practice-driven AI/ML research. However, these review guidelines tend to most
concretely recognize projects that simultaneously achieve deployment and novel
ML methodological innovation. We argue that this introduces incentives for
researchers that undermine the sustainability of a broader research ecosystem
of social impact, which benefits from projects that make contributions on
single front (applied or methodological) that may better meet project partner
needs. Our position is that researchers and reviewers in machine learning for
social impact must simultaneously adopt: 1) a more expansive conception of
social impacts beyond deployment and 2) more rigorous evaluations of the impact
of deployed systems.

Conclusion: RULE能有效处理DNC问题，提升多模态实体对齐的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Multi-modal entity alignment (MMEA) aims to identify equivalent entities
across heterogeneous multi-modal knowledge graphs (MMKGs), where each entity is
described by attributes from various modalities. Existing methods typically
assume that both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences are faultless,
which is often violated in real-world MMKGs due to the reliance on expert
annotations. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet
under-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).
DNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and
inter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences. To address
the DNC problem, we propose a robust MMEA framework termed RULE. RULE first
estimates the reliability of both intra-entity and inter-graph correspondences
via a dedicated two-fold principle. Leveraging the estimated reliabilities,
RULE mitigates the negative impact of intra-entity noise during attribute
fusion and prevents overfitting to noisy inter-graph correspondences during
inter-graph discrepancy elimination. Beyond the training-time designs, RULE
further incorporates a correspondence reasoning module that uncovers the
underlying attribute-attribute connection across graphs, guaranteeing more
accurate equivalent entity identification. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks verify the effectiveness of our method against the DNC compared with
seven state-of-the-art methods.The code is available at

Motivation: 随着LLM规模和训练数据的增加，推理成本成为重要问题，但模型准确性与推理效率之间的权衡尚未充分探索。

Method: 通过分析隐藏大小、MLP与注意力的参数分配比例（mlp-to-attention ratio）和分组查询注意力（GQA）等架构因素，提出条件缩放定律和搜索框架。训练了200多个模型验证方法。

Result: 条件缩放定律能可靠预测最优架构选择，优化后的模型在相同训练预算下比LLaMA-3.2准确率提高2.1%，推理吞吐量提升42%。

Conclusion: 条件缩放定律和搜索框架能有效平衡LLM的准确性和推理效率，为未来模型设计提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Scaling the number of parameters and the size of training data has proven to
be an effective strategy for improving large language model (LLM) performance.
Yet, as these models grow increasingly powerful and widely deployed, the cost
of inference has become a pressing concern. Despite its importance, the
trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency remains
underexplored. In this work, we examine how key architectural factors, hidden
size, the allocation of parameters between MLP and attention (mlp-to-attention
ratio), and grouped-query attention (GQA), influence both inference cost and
accuracy. We introduce a conditional scaling law that augments the Chinchilla
framework with architectural information, along with a search framework for
identifying architectures that are simultaneously inference-efficient and
accurate. To validate our approach, we train more than 200 models spanning 80M
to 3B parameters and 8B to 100B training tokens, and fit the proposed
conditional scaling law. Our results show that the conditional scaling law
reliably predicts optimal architectural choices and that the resulting models
outperform existing open-source baselines. Under the same training budget,
optimized architectures achieve up to 2.1% higher accuracy and 42% greater
inference throughput compared to LLaMA-3.2.

Abstract: Multi-Task Learning (MTL) enables a single model to learn multiple tasks
simultaneously, leveraging knowledge transfer among tasks for enhanced
generalization, and has been widely applied across various domains. However,
task imbalance remains a major challenge in MTL. Although balancing the
convergence speeds of different tasks is an effective approach to address this
issue, it is highly challenging to accurately characterize the training
dynamics and convergence speeds of multiple tasks within the complex MTL
system. To this end, we attempt to analyze the training dynamics in MTL by
leveraging Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory and propose a new MTL method,
NTKMTL. Specifically, we introduce an extended NTK matrix for MTL and adopt
spectral analysis to balance the convergence speeds of multiple tasks, thereby
mitigating task imbalance. Based on the approximation via shared
representation, we further propose NTKMTL-SR, achieving training efficiency
while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
benchmarks, including both multi-task supervised learning and multi-task
reinforcement learning. Source code is available at

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于基线，成功缓解竞争性退化，生成图像既保持身份特征又准确遵循复杂文本提示。

Conclusion: Customized-GRPO在身份保持和提示跟随之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation models face a fundamental trade-off between
identity preservation (fidelity) and prompt adherence (editability). While
online reinforcement learning (RL), specifically GPRO, offers a promising
solution, we find that a naive application of GRPO leads to competitive
degradation, as the simple linear aggregation of rewards with static weights
causes conflicting gradient signals and a misalignment with the temporal
dynamics of the diffusion process. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Customized-GRPO, a novel framework featuring two key innovations: (i)
Synergy-Aware Reward Shaping (SARS), a non-linear mechanism that explicitly
penalizes conflicted reward signals and amplifies synergistic ones, providing a
sharper and more decisive gradient. (ii) Time-Aware Dynamic Weighting (TDW),
which aligns the optimization pressure with the model's temporal dynamics by
prioritizing prompt-following in the early, identity preservation in the later.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
naive GRPO baselines, successfully mitigating competitive degradation. Our
model achieves a superior balance, generating images that both preserve key
identity features and accurately adhere to complex textual prompts.

Abstract: This paper is concerned with online time series forecasting, where unknown
distribution shifts occur over time, i.e., latent variables influence the
mapping from historical to future observations. To develop an automated way of
online time series forecasting, we propose a Theoretical framework for Online
Time-series forecasting (TOT in short) with theoretical guarantees.
Specifically, we prove that supplying a forecaster with latent variables
tightens the Bayes risk, the benefit endures under estimation uncertainty of
latent variables and grows as the latent variables achieve a more precise
identifiability. To better introduce latent variables into online forecasting
algorithms, we further propose to identify latent variables with minimal
adjacent observations. Based on these results, we devise a model-agnostic
blueprint by employing a temporal decoder to match the distribution of observed
variables and two independent noise estimators to model the causal inference of
latent variables and mixing procedures of observed variables, respectively.
Experiment results on synthetic data support our theoretical claims. Moreover,
plug-in implementations built on several baselines yield general improvement
across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness in real-world
applications.

Conclusion: 提出的算法有效解决了毫米波通信中的波束对准和跟踪问题，无需依赖不现实的假设。

Abstract: In millimeter wave (mmWave) communications, beam alignment and tracking are
crucial to combat the significant path loss. As scanning the entire directional
space is inefficient, designing an efficient and robust method to identify the
optimal beam directions is essential. Since traditional bandit algorithms
require a long time horizon to converge under large beam spaces, many existing
works propose efficient bandit algorithms for beam alignment by relying on
unimodality or multimodality assumptions on the reward function's structure.
However, such assumptions often do not hold (or cannot be strictly satisfied)
in practice, which causes such algorithms to converge to choosing suboptimal
beams.
  In this work, we propose two physics-informed bandit algorithms
\textit{pretc} and \textit{prgreedy} that exploit the sparse multipath property
of mmWave channels - a generic but realistic assumption - which is connected to
the Phase Retrieval Bandit problem. Our algorithms treat the parameters of each
path as black boxes and maintain optimal estimates of them based on sampled
historical rewards. \textit{pretc} starts with a random exploration phase and
then commits to the optimal beam under the estimated reward function.
\textit{prgreedy} performs such estimation in an online manner and chooses the
best beam under current estimates. Our algorithms can also be easily adapted to
beam tracking in the mobile setting. Through experiments using both the
synthetic DeepMIMO dataset and the real-world DeepSense6G dataset, we
demonstrate that both algorithms outperform existing approaches in a wide range
of scenarios across diverse channel environments, showing their
generalizability and robustness.

Conclusion: CHiLD框架成功解决了分层潜在变量联合分布的识别问题，并展示了其在时间序列建模中的优越性。

Abstract: Modeling hierarchical latent dynamics behind time series data is critical for
capturing temporal dependencies across multiple levels of abstraction in
real-world tasks. However, existing temporal causal representation learning
methods fail to capture such dynamics, as they fail to recover the joint
distribution of hierarchical latent variables from \textit{single-timestep
observed variables}. Interestingly, we find that the joint distribution of
hierarchical latent variables can be uniquely determined using three
conditionally independent observations. Building on this insight, we propose a
Causally Hierarchical Latent Dynamic (CHiLD) identification framework. Our
approach first employs temporal contextual observed variables to identify the
joint distribution of multi-layer latent variables. Sequentially, we exploit
the natural sparsity of the hierarchical structure among latent variables to
identify latent variables within each layer. Guided by the theoretical results,
we develop a time series generative model grounded in variational inference.
This model incorporates a contextual encoder to reconstruct multi-layer latent
variables and normalize flow-based hierarchical prior networks to impose the
independent noise condition of hierarchical latent dynamics. Empirical
evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets validate our theoretical
claims and demonstrate the effectiveness of CHiLD in modeling hierarchical
latent dynamics.

TL;DR: 研究了嵌入维度对强化学习训练的Transformer内部“世界模型”形成的影响，发现较大维度能产生更忠实、一致和鲁棒的内部表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索嵌入维度如何影响Transformer在排序任务中内部世界模型的形成。

Method: 通过数百次实验，分析不同嵌入维度下模型的注意力权重和内部表示。

Result: 高嵌入维度能增强结构化内部表示的形成，并提高可解释性；发现两种机制：注意力权重矩阵的最后一行单调编码全局顺序，选择的交换与编码值的最大相邻差异对齐。

Conclusion: Transformer能构建结构化内部世界模型，模型大小不仅提升性能，还改善表示质量；提供了可用于类似算法任务的指标和分析。

Abstract: We investigate how embedding dimension affects the emergence of an internal
"world model" in a transformer trained with reinforcement learning to perform
bubble-sort-style adjacent swaps. Models achieve high accuracy even with very
small embedding dimensions, but larger dimensions yield more faithful,
consistent, and robust internal representations. In particular, higher
embedding dimensions strengthen the formation of structured internal
representation and lead to better interpretability. After hundreds of
experiments, we observe two consistent mechanisms: (1) the last row of the
attention weight matrix monotonically encodes the global ordering of tokens;
and (2) the selected transposition aligns with the largest adjacent difference
of these encoded values. Our results provide quantitative evidence that
transformers build structured internal world models and that model size
improves representation quality in addition to end performance. We release our
metrics and analyses, which can be used to probe similar algorithmic tasks.

*Taeseong Yoon,Heeyoung Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种灵活的Dirichlet分布方法（F-EDL），用于改进不确定性量化（UQ），在复杂场景中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EDL方法因Dirichlet分布的假设限制，在复杂或意外情况下鲁棒性不足，需更灵活的不确定性表示。

Method: 通过预测灵活的Dirichlet分布（F-EDL）扩展EDL，提供更具表达力和适应性的不确定性量化。

Result: F-EDL在多种评估场景（经典、长尾、噪声）中表现出最先进的不确定性量化性能。

Conclusion: F-EDL通过灵活的Dirichlet分布显著提升了不确定性量化的泛化能力和可靠性。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is crucial for deploying machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, where overconfident predictions can lead to
serious consequences. An effective UQ method must balance computational
efficiency with the ability to generalize across diverse scenarios. Evidential
deep learning (EDL) achieves efficiency by modeling uncertainty through the
prediction of a Dirichlet distribution over class probabilities. However, the
restrictive assumption of Dirichlet-distributed class probabilities limits
EDL's robustness, particularly in complex or unforeseen situations. To address
this, we propose \textit{flexible evidential deep learning}
($\mathcal{F}$-EDL), which extends EDL by predicting a flexible Dirichlet
distribution -- a generalization of the Dirichlet distribution -- over class
probabilities. This approach provides a more expressive and adaptive
representation of uncertainty, significantly enhancing UQ generalization and
reliability under challenging scenarios. We theoretically establish several
advantages of $\mathcal{F}$-EDL and empirically demonstrate its
state-of-the-art UQ performance across diverse evaluation settings, including
classical, long-tailed, and noisy in-distribution scenarios.

TL;DR: TCCM是一种新的半监督异常检测方法，通过时间条件收缩匹配简化了流匹配框架，提高了效率和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DTE在推理时计算成本高，TCCM旨在平衡检测精度和推理成本。

Method: TCCM预测时间条件收缩向量，避免求解微分方程，采用一步偏差评分策略。

Result: 在ADBench基准测试中，TCCM在高维和大规模数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: TCCM在检测精度和推理成本之间取得了良好平衡，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce Time-Conditioned Contraction Matching (TCCM), a novel method for
semi-supervised anomaly detection in tabular data. TCCM is inspired by flow
matching, a recent generative modeling framework that learns velocity fields
between probability distributions and has shown strong performance compared to
diffusion models and generative adversarial networks. Instead of directly
applying flow matching as originally formulated, TCCM builds on its core idea
-- learning velocity fields between distributions -- but simplifies the
framework by predicting a time-conditioned contraction vector toward a fixed
target (the origin) at each sampled time step. This design offers three key
advantages: (1) a lightweight and scalable training objective that removes the
need for solving ordinary differential equations during training and inference;
(2) an efficient scoring strategy called one time-step deviation, which
quantifies deviation from expected contraction behavior in a single forward
pass, addressing the inference bottleneck of existing continuous-time models
such as DTE (a diffusion-based model with leading anomaly detection accuracy
but heavy inference cost); and (3) explainability and provable robustness, as
the learned velocity field operates directly in input space, making the anomaly
score inherently feature-wise attributable; moreover, the score function is
Lipschitz-continuous with respect to the input, providing theoretical
guarantees under small perturbations. Extensive experiments on the ADBench
benchmark show that TCCM strikes a favorable balance between detection accuracy
and inference cost, outperforming state-of-the-art methods -- especially on
high-dimensional and large-scale datasets. The source code is available at our
GitHub repository.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法理论大多基于折扣因子γ < 1，但近期大语言模型RL研究使用γ = 1的无折扣设置，导致现有理论不适用。

Method: 通过将MDP状态分类为循环和瞬态状态，并引入瞬态访问度量替代经典状态访问度量。

Result: 为无折扣总奖励无限时域MDP提供了策略梯度方法的理论分析。

Conclusion: 新方法扩展了策略梯度理论的应用范围，适用于无折扣设置。

Abstract: The classical policy gradient method is the theoretical and conceptual
foundation of modern policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. Most
rigorous analyses of such methods, particularly those establishing convergence
guarantees, assume a discount factor $\gamma < 1$. In contrast, however, a
recent line of work on policy-based RL for large language models uses the
undiscounted total-reward setting with $\gamma = 1$, rendering much of the
existing theory inapplicable. In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy
gradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs
based on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into
recurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that
assign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL
models employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state
visitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\gamma = 1$) can be replaced
with a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.

Conclusion: 论文为在线二分类和归纳推理提供了更现实的视角，揭示了可计算性在理论模型中的重要性。

Abstract: Understanding when learning is possible is a fundamental task in the theory
of machine learning. However, many characterizations known from the literature
deal with abstract learning as a mathematical object and ignore the crucial
question: when can learning be implemented as a computer program? We address
this question for universal online learning, a generalist theoretical model of
online binary classification, recently characterized by Bousquet et al.
(STOC'21). In this model, there is no hypothesis fixed in advance; instead,
Adversary -- playing the role of Nature -- can change their mind as long as
local consistency with the given class of hypotheses is maintained. We require
Learner to achieve a finite number of mistakes while using a strategy that can
be implemented as a computer program. We show that universal online learning
does not imply computable universal online learning, even if the class of
hypotheses is relatively easy from a computability-theoretic perspective. We
then study the agnostic variant of computable universal online learning and
provide an exact characterization of classes that are learnable in this sense.
We also consider a variant of proper universal online learning and show exactly
when it is possible. Together, our results give a more realistic perspective on
the existing theory of online binary classification and the related problem of
inductive inference.

Conclusion: Hydra Ensembles是一种高效且性能优越的UQ方法，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for deploying deep neural
networks in safety-critical settings. Although methods like Deep Ensembles
achieve strong UQ performance, their high computational and memory costs hinder
scalability to large models. We introduce Hydra Ensembles, an efficient
transformer-based ensemble that prunes attention heads to create diverse
members and merges them via a new multi-head attention with grouped
fully-connected layers. This yields a compact model with inference speed close
to a single network, matching or surpassing Deep Ensembles in UQ performance
without retraining from scratch. We also provide an in-depth analysis of
pruning, showing that naive approaches can harm calibration, whereas Hydra
Ensembles preserves robust uncertainty. Experiments on image and text
classification tasks, with various architectures, show consistent gains over
Deep Ensembles. Remarkably, in zero-shot classification on ImageNet-1k, our
approach surpasses state of the art methods, even without requiring additional
training.

Result: FGP将编码器性能提升高达106%（Precision-1%）。

Conclusion: FGP是一种高效且性能优越的神经架构编码方法。

Abstract: The performance of a deep learning model on a specific task and dataset
depends heavily on its neural architecture, motivating considerable efforts to
rapidly and accurately identify architectures suited to the target task and
dataset. To achieve this, researchers use machine learning models-typically
neural architecture encoders-to predict the performance of a neural
architecture. Many state-of-the-art encoders aim to capture information flow
within a neural architecture, which reflects how information moves through the
forward pass and backpropagation, via a specialized model structure. However,
due to their complicated structures, these flow-based encoders are
significantly slower to process neural architectures compared to simpler
encoders, presenting a notable practical challenge. To address this, we propose
FGP, a novel pre-training method for neural architecture encoding that trains
an encoder to capture the information flow without requiring specialized model
structures. FGP trains an encoder to reconstruct a flow surrogate, our proposed
representation of the neural architecture's information flow. Our experiments
show that FGP boosts encoder performance by up to 106% in Precision-1%,
compared to the same encoder trained solely with supervised learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中目标域可能包含源域中未出现的类别，现有图域自适应模型仅关注闭集设置，无法处理开放集问题。

Result: 在多个公开数据集上验证了GraphRTA的性能优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphRTA能够有效识别目标域中的未知类别，同时保持已知类别的分类性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation has become a promising paradigm for
transferring knowledge from a fully labeled source graph to an unlabeled target
graph. Existing graph domain adaptation models primarily focus on the
closed-set setting, where the source and target domains share the same label
spaces. However, this assumption might not be practical in the real-world
scenarios, as the target domain might include classes that are not present in
the source domain. In this paper, we investigate the problem of unsupervised
open-set graph domain adaptation, where the goal is to not only correctly
classify target nodes into the known classes, but also recognize previously
unseen node types into the unknown class. Towards this end, we propose a novel
framework called GraphRTA, which conducts reprogramming on both the graph and
model sides. Specifically, we reprogram the graph by modifying target graph
structure and node features, which facilitates better separation of known and
unknown classes. Meanwhile, we also perform model reprogramming by pruning
domain-specific parameters to reduce bias towards the source graph while
preserving parameters that capture transferable patterns across graphs.
Additionally, we extend the classifier with an extra dimension for the unknown
class, thus eliminating the need of manually specified threshold in open-set
recognition. Comprehensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate
that our proposed model can achieve satisfied performance compared with recent
state-of-the-art baselines. Our source codes and datasets are publicly
available at https://github.com/cszhangzhen/GraphRTA.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become essential tools for learning on
relational data, yet the performance of a single GNN is often limited by the
heterogeneity present in real-world graphs. Recent advances in
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) frameworks demonstrate that assembling multiple,
explicitly diverse GNNs with distinct generalization patterns can significantly
improve performance. In this work, we present the first systematic empirical
study of expert-level diversification techniques for GNN ensembles. Evaluating
20 diversification strategies -- including random re-initialization,
hyperparameter tuning, architectural variation, directionality modeling, and
training data partitioning -- across 14 node classification benchmarks, we
construct and analyze over 200 ensemble variants. Our comprehensive evaluation
examines each technique in terms of expert diversity, complementarity, and
ensemble performance. We also uncovers mechanistic insights into training
maximally diverse experts. These findings provide actionable guidance for
expert training and the design of effective MoE frameworks on graph data. Our

We examine the approximation rates of ReLU$^{k}$ activation functions, proving
that the optimal rate cannot be achieved under $\ell^{1}$-bounded coefficients
or insufficient smoothness conditions.
  We also establish optimal approximation rates in various norms for functions
in Barron spaces and Sobolev spaces, confirming the curse of dimensionality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 弱监督学习通常依赖粗粒度的聚合信号而非实例标签，NTMP监督（每个训练样本为含M个正例的N元组）在图像分类和多实例测量等任务中常见。研究目标是利用计数信号实现高效训练。

Method: 通过将元组生成过程与潜在实例边际关联，推导了固定和可变元组大小的闭式无偏风险估计器（URE），并引入ReLU修正以提高稳定性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，该方法优于代表性弱监督基线，且在类别不平衡和不同元组配置下表现稳健。

Conclusion: 计数信号可通过理论支持且实践稳定的目标有效利用，为弱监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Weakly supervised learning often operates with coarse aggregate signals
rather than instance labels. We study a setting where each training example is
an $n$-tuple containing exactly m positives, while only the count m per tuple
is observed. This NTMP (N-tuple with M positives) supervision arises in, e.g.,
image classification with region proposals and multi-instance measurements. We
show that tuple counts admit a trainable unbiased risk estimator (URE) by
linking the tuple-generation process to latent instance marginals. Starting
from fixed (n,m), we derive a closed-form URE and extend it to variable tuple
sizes, variable counts, and their combination. Identification holds whenever
the effective mixing rate is separated from the class prior. We establish
generalization bounds via Rademacher complexity and prove statistical
consistency with standard rates under mild regularity assumptions. To improve
finite-sample stability, we introduce simple ReLU corrections to the URE that
preserve asymptotic correctness. Across benchmarks converted to NTMP tasks, the
approach consistently outperforms representative weak-supervision baselines and
yields favorable precision-recall and F1 trade-offs. It remains robust under
class-prior imbalance and across diverse tuple configurations, demonstrating
that count-only supervision can be exploited effectively through a
theoretically grounded and practically stable objective.

Conclusion: MAGDrop结合理论和实践，为高风险应用提供了增强DNN泛化能力的框架。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve remarkable performance but often suffer
from overfitting due to their high capacity. We introduce Momentum-Adaptive
Gradient Dropout (MAGDrop), a novel regularization method that dynamically
adjusts dropout rates on activations based on current gradients and accumulated
momentum, enhancing stability in non-convex optimization landscapes. To
theoretically justify MAGDrop's effectiveness, we derive a tightened PAC-Bayes
generalization bound that accounts for its adaptive nature, achieving up to 20%
sharper bounds compared to standard approaches by leveraging momentum-driven
perturbation control. Empirically, the activation-based MAGDrop outperforms
baseline regularization techniques, including standard dropout and adaptive
gradient regularization, by 1-2% in test accuracy on MNIST (99.52%) and
CIFAR-10 (90.63%), with generalization gaps of 0.48% and 7.14%, respectively.
Our work bridges theoretical insights and practical advancements, offering a

Result: 在标准基准和ELIL四肽系统中，CMT表现优于现有方法，有效样本量提高2.5倍以上。

Conclusion: CMT是一种高效且鲁棒的采样方法，适用于复杂物理系统的Boltzmann分布采样。

Abstract: Efficient sampling from high-dimensional and multimodal unnormalized
probability distributions is a central challenge in many areas of science and
machine learning. We focus on Boltzmann generators (BGs) that aim to sample the
Boltzmann distribution of physical systems, such as molecules, at a given
temperature. Classical variational approaches that minimize the reverse
Kullback-Leibler divergence are prone to mode collapse, while annealing-based
methods, commonly using geometric schedules, can suffer from mass teleportation
and rely heavily on schedule tuning. We introduce Constrained Mass Transport
(CMT), a variational framework that generates intermediate distributions under
constraints on both the KL divergence and the entropy decay between successive
steps. These constraints enhance distributional overlap, mitigate mass
teleportation, and counteract premature convergence. Across standard BG
benchmarks and the here introduced ELIL tetrapeptide, the largest system
studied to date without access to samples from molecular dynamics, CMT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art variational methods, achieving more
than 2.5x higher effective sample size while avoiding mode collapse.

Conclusion: SE-HTGNN通过创新的学习范式显著提升了异质时序图的表示学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Heterogeneous temporal graphs (HTGs) are ubiquitous data structures in the
real world. Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous
attention-based neural networks have been proposed. Despite these successes,
existing methods rely on a decoupled temporal and spatial learning paradigm,
which weakens interactions of spatio-temporal information and leads to a high
model complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for
HTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network
(SE-HTGNN). Specifically, we innovatively integrate temporal modeling into
spatial learning via a novel dynamic attention mechanism, which retains
attention information from historical graph snapshots to guide subsequent
attention computation, thereby improving the overall discriminative
representations learning of HTGs. Additionally, to comprehensively and
adaptively understand HTGs, we leverage large language models to prompt
SE-HTGNN, enabling the model to capture the implicit properties of node types
as prior knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SE-HTGNN achieves up
to 10x speed-up over the state-of-the-art and latest baseline while maintaining
the best forecasting accuracy.

Conclusion: 知识图谱的公平性研究需要不同于传统图数据的方法，同时需综合考虑GNN架构和训练条件以实现公平性和准确性的平衡。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for learning from
graph-structured data but often produce biased predictions with respect to
sensitive attributes. Fairness-aware GNNs have been actively studied for
mitigating biased predictions. However, no prior studies have evaluated
fairness-aware GNNs on knowledge graphs, which are one of the most important
graphs in many applications, such as recommender systems. Therefore, we
introduce a benchmarking study on knowledge graphs. We generate new graphs from
three knowledge graphs, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, that are significantly
larger than the existing graph datasets used in fairness studies. We benchmark
inprocessing and preprocessing methods in different GNN backbones and early
stopping conditions. We find several key insights: (i) knowledge graphs show
different trends from existing datasets; clearer trade-offs between prediction
accuracy and fairness metrics than other graphs in fairness-aware GNNs, (ii)
the performance is largely affected by not only fairness-aware GNN methods but
also GNN backbones and early stopping conditions, and (iii) preprocessing
methods often improve fairness metrics, while inprocessing methods improve
prediction accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在强化学习的安全探索中难以平衡安全约束与任务性能。

Method: 引入Uncertain Safety Critic (USC)，结合不确定性感知调制和细化训练。

Result: USC减少约40%的安全违规，保持或提高奖励，预测与真实成本梯度误差减少约83%。

Conclusion: USC打破了安全与性能的传统权衡，为可扩展的安全强化学习铺平道路。

Abstract: Ensuring the safe exploration of reinforcement learning (RL) agents is
critical for deployment in real-world systems. Yet existing approaches struggle
to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple
task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints
frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients
and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a
novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into
critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions
while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve
effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces
safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher
rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by

TL;DR: COPPOL是一种结合了分布无关、有限样本安全保证的感知到策略学习方法，显著提高了危险覆盖率和导航安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键环境中，现有方法假设完美的危险检测能力，而不确定性感知方法缺乏有限样本保证。

Method: COPPOL通过整合分布无关的安全保证到语义分割中，生成校准的危险地图，并用于下游强化学习规划。

Result: 在两个卫星基准测试中，COPPOL显著提高了危险覆盖率（最高6倍），减少了导航中的危险违规（约50%）。

Conclusion: COPPOL在分布偏移下仍保持安全性和效率，适用于安全关键环境。

Abstract: Reliable navigation in safety-critical environments requires both accurate
hazard perception and principled uncertainty handling to strengthen downstream
safety handling. Despite the effectiveness of existing approaches, they assume
perfect hazard detection capabilities, while uncertainty-aware perception
approaches lack finite-sample guarantees. We present COPPOL, a conformal-driven
perception-to-policy learning approach that integrates distribution-free,
finite-sample safety guarantees into semantic segmentation, yielding calibrated
hazard maps with rigorous bounds for missed detections. These maps induce
risk-aware cost fields for downstream RL planning. Across two satellite-derived
benchmarks, COPPOL increases hazard coverage (up to 6x) compared to comparative
baselines, achieving near-complete detection of unsafe regions while reducing
hazardous violations during navigation (up to approx 50%). More importantly,
our approach remains robust to distributional shift, preserving both safety and
efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对医院警报系统等应用的新型ROC分析方法，解决了传统ROC无法满足精度和容量约束的问题，并引入了部分VOROS作为性能指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ROC分析无法满足医院警报系统中对最小精度约束和预测阳性数量上限的需求，且无法反映假阳性和假阴性的不对称成本。

Method: 通过定义ROC空间中的可行区域，并引入部分VOROS（部分ROC曲面体积）作为性能指标，该方法考虑了精度和容量约束。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上的实验表明，部分VOROS在成本感知的医院警报应用中优于其他指标。

Conclusion: 该方法为医院警报系统等应用提供了一种更有效的分类器评估工具，能够更好地满足实际部署需求。

Abstract: The ROC curve is widely used to assess binary classification performance. Yet
for some applications such as alert systems for hospitalized patient
monitoring, conventional ROC analysis cannot capture crucial factors that
impact deployment, such as enforcing a minimum precision constraint to avoid
false alarm fatigue or imposing an upper bound on the number of predicted
positives to represent the capacity of hospital staff. The usual area under the
curve metric also does not reflect asymmetric costs for false positives and
false negatives. In this paper we address all three of these issues. First, we
show how the subset of classifiers that meet given precision and capacity
constraints can be represented as a feasible region in ROC space. We establish
the geometry of this feasible region. We then define the partial area of lesser
classifiers, a performance metric that is monotonic with cost and only accounts
for the feasible portion of ROC space. Averaging this area over a desired range
of cost parameters results in the partial volume over the ROC surface, or
partial VOROS. In experiments predicting mortality risk using vital sign
history on the MIMIC-IV dataset, we show this cost-aware metric is better than
alternatives for ranking classifiers in hospital alert applications.

<details>

Motivation: 现有LLM后门方法选择的触发词在常规上下文中罕见，低估了知识蒸馏的安全风险。

Method: 提出T-MTB技术，构建由常见触发词组成的复合后门触发器，确保教师模型隐蔽且后门可传递。

Result: T-MTB成功在两种攻击场景（越狱和内容调控）和四种LLM模型家族中实现了后门传递。

Conclusion: 知识蒸馏存在潜在安全风险，T-MTB为研究可传递后门提供了有效工具。

Abstract: LLMs are often used by downstream users as teacher models for knowledge
distillation, compressing their capabilities into memory-efficient models.
However, as these teacher models may stem from untrusted parties, distillation
can raise unexpected security risks. In this paper, we investigate the security
implications of knowledge distillation from backdoored teacher models. First,
we show that prior backdoors mostly do not transfer onto student models. Our
key insight is that this is because existing LLM backdooring methods choose
trigger tokens that rarely occur in usual contexts. We argue that this
underestimates the security risks of knowledge distillation and introduce a new
backdooring technique, T-MTB, that enables the construction and study of
transferable backdoors. T-MTB carefully constructs a composite backdoor
trigger, made up of several specific tokens that often occur individually in
anticipated distillation datasets. As such, the poisoned teacher remains
stealthy, while during distillation the individual presence of these tokens
provides enough signal for the backdoor to transfer onto the student. Using
T-MTB, we demonstrate and extensively study the security risks of transferable
backdoors across two attack scenarios, jailbreaking and content modulation, and
across four model families of LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统进入高风险领域，评估需超越预测准确性，涵盖更多责任维度。

Method: 提出RAISE框架，评估三种深度学习模型（MLP、Tabular ResNet、Transformer）在金融、医疗和社会经济数据集上的表现。

Result: MLP在可持续性和稳健性上表现突出，Transformer在可解释性和公平性上表现优异但环境成本高，Tabular ResNet表现均衡。

Conclusion: 没有单一模型在所有责任标准上占优，需多维度评估以选择负责任模型。

Abstract: As AI systems enter high-stakes domains, evaluation must extend beyond
predictive accuracy to include explainability, fairness, robustness, and
sustainability. We introduce RAISE (Responsible AI Scoring and Evaluation), a
unified framework that quantifies model performance across these four
dimensions and aggregates them into a single, holistic Responsibility Score. We
evaluated three deep learning models: a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), a Tabular
ResNet, and a Feature Tokenizer Transformer, on structured datasets from
finance, healthcare, and socioeconomics. Our findings reveal critical
trade-offs: the MLP demonstrated strong sustainability and robustness, the
Transformer excelled in explainability and fairness at a very high
environmental cost, and the Tabular ResNet offered a balanced profile. These
results underscore that no single model dominates across all responsibility
criteria, highlighting the necessity of multi-dimensional evaluation for
responsible model selection. Our implementation is available at:

Result: 在18个基准数据集上表现优于现有方法，尤其在胃癌分类和药物毒性预测等挑战性领域。

Conclusion: HeFS能有效识别被忽视但有信息量的特征，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Feature selection is a combinatorial optimization problem that is NP-hard.
Conventional approaches often employ heuristic or greedy strategies, which are
prone to premature convergence and may fail to capture subtle yet informative
features. This limitation becomes especially critical in high-dimensional
datasets, where complex and interdependent feature relationships prevail. We
introduce the HeFS (Helper-Enhanced Feature Selection) framework to refine
feature subsets produced by existing algorithms. HeFS systematically searches
the residual feature space to identify a Helper Set - features that complement
the original subset and improve classification performance. The approach
employs a biased initialization scheme and a ratio-guided mutation mechanism
within a genetic algorithm, coupled with Pareto-based multi-objective
optimization to jointly maximize predictive accuracy and feature
complementarity. Experiments on 18 benchmark datasets demonstrate that HeFS
consistently identifies overlooked yet informative features and achieves
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including in challenging
domains such as gastric cancer classification, drug toxicity prediction, and
computer science applications. The code and datasets are available at

Motivation: GNN在对抗攻击下的鲁棒性问题需要解决，传统方法依赖于复杂求解器，效率较低。

Result: 在多种GNN变体和数据集上验证了RobLight的有效性。

Conclusion: RobLight在提升GNN结构鲁棒性方面优于现有方法。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are the predominant architecture for learning
over graphs. As with any machine learning model, and important issue is the
detection of adversarial attacks, where an adversary can change the output with
a small perturbation of the input. Techniques for solving the adversarial
robustness problem - determining whether such an attack exists - were
originally developed for image classification, but there are variants for many
other machine learning architectures. In the case of graph learning, the attack
model usually considers changes to the graph structure in addition to or
instead of the numerical features of the input, and the state of the art
techniques in the area proceed via reduction to constraint solving, working on
top of powerful solvers, e.g. for mixed integer programming. We show that it is
possible to improve on the state of the art in structural robustness by
replacing the use of powerful solvers by calls to efficient partial solvers,
which run in polynomial time but may be incomplete. We evaluate our tool
RobLight on a diverse set of GNN variants and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏时间采样数据下传统SINDy方法无法有效识别物理动力学微分方程的问题。

Method: 采用展开方案（unrolling scheme），通过迭代闭式方法或梯度下降方案，解耦数值时间步长与数据采样率。

Result: 实验表明，Unrolled-SINDy在传统SINDy和噪声鲁棒的iNeuralSINDy中均能解决非展开方法无法处理的问题。

Conclusion: Unrolled-SINDy方法在稀疏采样数据下表现出色，提升了PDE发现的稳定性和适用范围。

Abstract: Identifying from observation data the governing differential equations of a
physical dynamics is a key challenge in machine learning. Although approaches
based on SINDy have shown great promise in this area, they still fail to
address a whole class of real world problems where the data is sparsely sampled
in time. In this article, we introduce Unrolled-SINDy, a simple methodology
that leverages an unrolling scheme to improve the stability of explicit methods
for PDE discovery. By decorrelating the numerical time step size from the
sampling rate of the available data, our approach enables the recovery of
equation parameters that would not be the minimizers of the original SINDy
optimization problem due to large local truncation errors. Our method can be
exploited either through an iterative closed-form approach or by a gradient
descent scheme. Experiments show the versatility of our method. On both
traditional SINDy and state-of-the-art noise-robust iNeuralSINDy, with
different numerical schemes (Euler, RK4), our proposed unrolling scheme allows
to tackle problems not accessible to non-unrolled methods.

Result: 在密码学假设下，证明NSP设置下学习DFA是计算困难的。

Conclusion: NSP设置虽然提供了更丰富的标签信息，但学习某些概念类仍然具有计算挑战性。

Abstract: We study the learnability of languages in the Next Symbol Prediction (NSP)
setting, where a learner receives only positive examples from a language
together with, for every prefix, (i) whether the prefix itself is in the
language and (ii) which next symbols can lead to an accepting string. This
setting has been used in prior works to empirically analyze neural sequence
models, and additionally, we observe that efficient algorithms for the NSP
setting can be used to learn the (truncated) support of language models. We
formalize the setting so as to make it amenable to PAC-learning analysis. While
the setting provides a much richer set of labels than the conventional
classification setting, we show that learning concept classes such as DFAs and
Boolean formulas remains computationally hard. The proof is via a construction
that makes almost all additional labels uninformative, yielding a reduction
from the conventional learning problem to learning with NSP labels. Under
cryptographic assumptions, the reduction implies that the problem of learning
DFAs is computationally hard in the NSP setting.

Result: 揭示了单层线性自注意力模型在表示结构化动态函数时的局限性，并提出多层模型通过预条件梯度下降优化多目标的新解释。

Conclusion: 理论结果通过简化Transformer数值验证，为动态函数学习提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: Transformer architectures can solve unseen tasks based on input-output pairs
in a given prompt due to in-context learning (ICL). Existing theoretical
studies on ICL have mainly focused on linear regression tasks, often with
i.i.d. inputs. To understand how transformers express ICL when modeling
dynamics-driven functions, we investigate Markovian function learning through a
structured ICL setup, where we characterize the loss landscape to reveal
underlying optimization behaviors. Specifically, we (1) provide the closed-form
expression of the global minimizer (in an enlarged parameter space) for a
single-layer linear self-attention (LSA) model; (2) prove that recovering
transformer parameters that realize the optimal solution is NP-hard in general,
revealing a fundamental limitation of one-layer LSA in representing structured
dynamical functions; and (3) supply a novel interpretation of a multilayer LSA
as performing preconditioned gradient descent to optimize multiple objectives
beyond the square loss. These theoretical results are numerically validated
using simplified transformers.

Conclusion: 该方法为农业决策提供了高精度和可解释的工具，有助于应对气候变化下的农业韧性建设。

Abstract: Water is essential for agricultural productivity. Assessing water shortages
and reduced yield potential is a critical factor in decision-making for
ensuring agricultural productivity and food security. Crop simulation models,
which align with physical processes, offer intrinsic explainability but often
perform poorly. Conversely, machine learning models for crop yield modeling are
powerful and scalable, yet they commonly operate as black boxes and lack
adherence to the physical principles of crop growth. This study bridges this
gap by coupling the advantages of both worlds. We postulate that the crop yield
is inherently defined by the water availability. Therefore, we formulate crop
yield as a function of temporal water scarcity and predict both the crop
drought stress and the sensitivity to water scarcity at fine-scale resolution.
Sequentially modeling the crop yield response to water enables accurate yield
prediction. To enforce physical consistency, a novel physics-informed loss
function is proposed. We leverage multispectral satellite imagery,
meteorological data, and fine-scale yield data. Further, to account for the
uncertainty within the model, we build upon a deep ensemble approach. Our
method surpasses state-of-the-art models like LSTM and Transformers in crop
yield prediction with a coefficient of determination ($R^2$-score) of up to
0.82 while offering high explainability. This method offers decision support
for industry, policymakers, and farmers in building a more resilient
agriculture in times of changing climate conditions.

Result: 模型验证表明，传统行为模型可能不总是现实的，支持数据驱动且理论支持的方法。

Conclusion: 该模型为群体互动提供了新的预测能力，强调了数据驱动方法的重要性。

Abstract: We propose a flexible probabilistic model for predicting turn-taking patterns
in group conversations based solely on individual characteristics and past
speaking behavior. Many models of conversation dynamics cannot yield insights
that generalize beyond a single group. Moreover, past works often aim to
characterize speaking behavior through a universal formulation that may not be
suitable for all groups. We thus develop a generalization of prior conversation
models that predicts speaking turns among individuals in any group based on
their individual characteristics, that is, personality traits, and prior
speaking behavior. Importantly, our approach provides the novel ability to
learn how speaking inclination varies based on when individuals last spoke. We
apply our model to synthetic and real-world conversation data to verify the
proposed approach and characterize real group interactions. Our results
demonstrate that previous behavioral models may not always be realistic,
motivating our data-driven yet theoretically grounded approach.

Abstract: The vast majority of cardiovascular diseases may be preventable if early
signs and risk factors are detected. Cardiovascular monitoring with body-worn
sensor devices like sensor patches allows for the detection of such signs while
preserving the freedom and comfort of patients. However, the analysis of the
sensor data must be robust, reliable, efficient, and highly accurate. Deep
learning methods can automate data interpretation, reducing the workload of
clinicians. In this work, we analyze the feasibility of applying deep learning
models to the classification of synchronized electrocardiogram (ECG) and
phonocardiogram (PCG) recordings on resource-constrained medical edge devices.
We propose a convolutional neural network with early fusion of data to solve a
binary classification problem. We train and validate our model on the
synchronized ECG and PCG recordings from the Physionet Challenge 2016 dataset.
Our approach reduces memory footprint and compute cost by three orders of
magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art while maintaining competitive
accuracy. We demonstrate the applicability of our proposed model on medical
edge devices by analyzing energy consumption on a microcontroller and an
experimental sensor device setup, confirming that on-device inference can be
more energy-efficient than continuous data streaming.

Result: 模型量化和推测解码可提升效率，而前缀缓存和KV缓存量化可能降低小RLLM的性能或准确性。

Abstract: The reasoning large language model (RLLM) has been proven competitive in
solving complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, coding, compared to
general LLM. However, the serving performance and behavior of RLLM remains
unexplored, which may undermine the deployment and utilization of RLLM in
real-world scenario. To close this gap, in this paper, we conduct a
comprehensive study of RLLM service. We first perform a pilot study on
comparing the serving performance between RLLM and traditional LLM and reveal
that there are several distinct differences regarding serving behavior: (1)
significant memory usage and fluctuations; (2) straggler requests; (3) adaptive
running time; (4) domain preference. Then we further investigate whether
existing inference optimization techniques are valid for RLLM. Our main
takeaways are that model quantization methods and speculative decoding can
improve service system efficiency with small compromise to RLLM accuracy, while
prefix caching, KV cache quantization may even degrade accuracy or serving
performance for small RLLM. Lastly, we conduct evaluation under real world
workload modeled by Gamma distribution to verify our findings. Empirical
results of real world workload evaluation across different dataset are aligned
with our main findings regarding RLLM serving. We hope our work can provide the
research community and industry with insights to advance RLLM inference
serving.

Abstract: Casting complex inputs into tractable representations is a critical step
across various fields. Diverse embedding models emerge from differences in
architectures, loss functions, input modalities and datasets, each capturing
unique aspects of the input. Multi-teacher distillation leverages this
diversity to enrich representations but often remains tailored to specific
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a task-agnostic framework based on a
``majority vote" objective function. We demonstrate that this function is
bounded by the mutual information between student and teachers' embeddings,
leading to a task-agnostic distillation loss that eliminates dependence on
task-specific labels or prior knowledge. Our evaluations across text, vision
models, and molecular modeling show that our method effectively leverages
teacher diversity, resulting in representations enabling better performance for
a wide range of downstream tasks such as classification, clustering, or
regression. Additionally, we train and release state-of-the-art embedding
models, enhancing downstream performance in various modalities.

many real-world applications, such as energy management and stock investment,
agents can access multi-step predictions of future states, which provide
additional advantages for decision making. However, multi-step predictions are
inherently high-dimensional: naively embedding these predictions into an MDP
leads to an exponential blow-up in state space and the curse of dimensionality.
Moreover, existing RL theory provides few tools to analyze prediction-augmented
MDPs, as it typically works on one-step transition kernels and cannot
accommodate multi-step predictions with errors or partial action-coverage. We
address these challenges with three key innovations: First, we propose the
\emph{Bayesian value function} to characterize the optimal prediction-aware
policy tractably. Second, we develop a novel \emph{Bellman-Jensen Gap} analysis
on the Bayesian value function, which enables characterizing the value of
imperfect predictions. Third, we introduce BOLA (Bayesian Offline Learning with
Online Adaptation), a two-stage model-based RL algorithm that separates offline
Bayesian value learning from lightweight online adaptation to real-time
predictions. We prove that BOLA remains sample-efficient even under imperfect
predictions. We validate our theory and algorithm on synthetic MDPs and a
real-world wind energy storage control problem.

TL;DR: OmniCast是一个统一天气预测时间尺度的概率模型，通过VAE和扩散变换器减少误差累积，在中长期预测中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统数据驱动方法在长期天气预测中误差累积的问题。

Method: 结合VAE编码和扩散变换器生成未来潜在状态序列。

Result: 在中长期预测中表现优异，速度快10-20倍，并能稳定预测100年。

Conclusion: OmniCast在天气预测中具有高效和稳定的优势。

Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting across time scales is critical for anticipating
and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recent data-driven methods based
on deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but
struggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error
accumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose
OmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather
forecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model
that encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent
space, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of
future latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we
mask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their
distribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion
head. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future
tokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling
across space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive
approaches. The low-dimensional latent space enables modeling long sequences of
future latent states, allowing the transformer to learn weather dynamics beyond
initial conditions. OmniCast performs competitively with leading probabilistic
methods at the medium-range timescale while being 10x to 20x faster, and
achieves state-of-the-art performance at the subseasonal-to-seasonal scale
across accuracy, physics-based, and probabilistic metrics. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that OmniCast can generate stable rollouts up to 100 years ahead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了基于偏好的在线强化学习（PbRL），提出了一种新算法M-AUPO，通过最大化子集内的平均不确定性来选择多个动作，显著提高了样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多集中于成对比较，而多比较和排名反馈的性能保证未能随反馈长度增加而提升，甚至可能恶化。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用Plackett-Luce模型进行排名反馈，提出M-AUPO算法，通过最大化子集内的平均不确定性来选择动作。

Result: M-AUPO实现了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}} \right)$的次优性差距，表明更大的子集直接提升性能。

Conclusion: 这是PbRL中首个理论结果，明确展示了样本效率随子集大小提升的改进。

Abstract: We study online preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) with the goal
of improving sample efficiency. While a growing body of theoretical work has
emerged-motivated by PbRL's recent empirical success, particularly in aligning
large language models (LLMs)-most existing studies focus only on pairwise
comparisons. A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,
Thekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and
ranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even
deteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information
available. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for
ranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that
selects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the
offered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \frac{d}{T} \sqrt{ \sum_{t=1}^T \frac{1}{|S_t|}}
\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature
dimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$. This result
shows that larger subsets directly lead to improved performance and, notably,
the bound avoids the exponential dependence on the unknown parameter's norm,
which was a fundamental limitation in most previous works. Moreover, we
establish a near-matching lower bound of $\Omega \left( \frac{d}{K \sqrt{T}}
\right)$, where $K$ is the maximum subset size. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first theoretical result in PbRL with ranking feedback that
explicitly shows improved sample efficiency as a function of the subset size.

Motivation: 真实医疗数据难以获取，合成数据成为替代方案，但现有方法未充分考虑因果推理任务（尤其是治疗效应分析）的特殊需求。

Method: 提出三个合成数据应满足的标准（协变量分布、治疗分配机制、结果生成机制），并基于此设计评估指标和STEAM方法。

Result: STEAM在复杂数据生成过程中表现优于现有生成模型。

Conclusion: STEAM为医学治疗效应分析提供了高质量的合成数据生成方案。

Abstract: Causal inference is essential for developing and evaluating medical
interventions, yet real-world medical datasets are often difficult to access
due to regulatory barriers. This makes synthetic data a potentially valuable
asset that enables these medical analyses, along with the development of new
inference methods themselves. Generative models can produce synthetic data that
closely approximate real data distributions, yet existing methods do not
consider the unique challenges that downstream causal inference tasks, and
specifically those focused on treatments, pose. We establish a set of
desiderata that synthetic data containing treatments should satisfy to maximise
downstream utility: preservation of (i) the covariate distribution, (ii) the
treatment assignment mechanism, and (iii) the outcome generation mechanism.
Based on these desiderata, we propose a set of evaluation metrics to assess
such synthetic data. Finally, we present STEAM: a novel method for generating
Synthetic data for Treatment Effect Analysis in Medicine that mimics the
data-generating process of data containing treatments and optimises for our
desiderata. We empirically demonstrate that STEAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance across our metrics as compared to existing generative models,
particularly as the complexity of the true data-generating process increases.

Result: L2O-CFGD在性能上优于静态超参数的CFGD，部分任务接近黑盒元学习优化器的表现。

Conclusion: L2O-CFGD为研究者提供了高性能超参数选择和利用分数微分历史依赖性的工具。

Abstract: Fractional Gradient Descent (FGD) offers a novel and promising way to
accelerate optimization by incorporating fractional calculus into machine
learning. Although FGD has shown encouraging initial results across various
optimization tasks, it faces significant challenges with convergence behavior
and hyperparameter selection. Moreover, the impact of its hyperparameters is
not fully understood, and scheduling them is particularly difficult in
non-convex settings such as neural network training. To address these issues,
we propose a novel approach called Learning to Optimize Caputo Fractional
Gradient Descent (L2O-CFGD), which meta-learns how to dynamically tune the
hyperparameters of Caputo FGD (CFGD). Our method's meta-learned schedule
outperforms CFGD with static hyperparameters found through an extensive search
and, in some tasks, achieves performance comparable to a fully black-box
meta-learned optimizer. L2O-CFGD can thus serve as a powerful tool for
researchers to identify high-performing hyperparameters and gain insights on
how to leverage the history-dependence of the fractional differential in
optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有低比特量化感知训练方法仍与原生训练存在较大准确率差距，需改进梯度估计以减小量化损失。

Method: CAGE通过多目标优化视角，结合曲率信息校正STE梯度，平衡损失最小化与量化约束。

Result: 在800M参数的Llama风格模型上，CAGE在W4A4量化下比异常值处理方法多恢复10%的损失。

Conclusion: 曲率感知梯度校正能弥补当前异常值处理方法的性能差距，提升量化模型表现。

Abstract: Despite significant work on low-bit quantization-aware training (QAT), there
is still a large accuracy gap between such techniques and native training. To
address this, we introduce CAGE (Curvature-Aware Gradient Estimation), a new
QAT method that augments the straight-through estimator (STE) gradient with a
curvature-aware correction designed to counteract the loss increase induced by
quantization. CAGE is derived from a multi-objective view of QAT that balances
loss minimization with adherence to quantization constraints, yielding a
principled correction term that depends on local curvature information. On the
theoretical side, we introduce the notion of Pareto-optimal solutions for
quantized optimization, and establish that CAGE yields strong convergence
guarantees in the smooth non-convex setting. In terms of implementation, our
approach is optimizer-agnostic, but we provide a highly-efficient
implementation that leverages Adam statistics. When pre-training Llama-style
models of up to 800M-parameters, CAGE recovers over 10% of the
quantization-induced loss increase in the W4A4 regime over outlier-mitigation
methods. These results indicate that curvature-aware gradient corrections can
bridge the remaining performance gap beyond current outlier-handling methods.

Conclusion: SB-SETM能有效处理数据流并自动推断活跃主题数量，适用于动态场景。

Abstract: Online topic models are unsupervised algorithms to identify latent topics in
data streams that continuously evolve over time. Although these methods
naturally align with real-world scenarios, they have received considerably less
attention from the community compared to their offline counterparts, due to
specific additional challenges. To tackle these issues, we present SB-SETM, an
innovative model extending the Embedded Topic Model (ETM) to process data
streams by merging models formed on successive partial document batches. To
this end, SB-SETM (i) leverages a truncated stick-breaking construction for the
topic-per-document distribution, enabling the model to automatically infer from
the data the appropriate number of active topics at each timestep; and (ii)
introduces a merging strategy for topic embeddings based on a continuous
formulation of optimal transport adapted to the high dimensionality of the
latent topic space. Numerical experiments show SB-SETM outperforming baselines
on simulated scenarios. We extensively test it on a real-world corpus of news
articles covering the Russian-Ukrainian war throughout 2022-2023.

Motivation: 研究生物学习的连续时间特性，解决传统离散更新和阶段分离模型的局限性。

Method: 通过连续时间神经模型，模拟和分析多种学习规则（如SGD、FA、DFA、KP）的动态行为。

Result: 模型在生物时间尺度下稳定学习，且学习效果依赖于时间重叠和突触可塑性时间尺度。

Conclusion: 功能性可塑性窗口需在几秒范围内，为生物电路中的误差驱动学习提供了可测试的预测。

Abstract: Biological learning unfolds continuously in time, yet most algorithmic models
rely on discrete updates and separate inference and learning phases. We study a
continuous-time neural model that unifies several biologically plausible
learning algorithms and removes the need for phase separation. Rules including
stochastic gradient descent (SGD), feedback alignment (FA), direct feedback
alignment (DFA), and Kolen-Pollack (KP) emerge naturally as limiting cases of
the dynamics. Simulations show that these continuous-time networks stably learn
at biological timescales, even under temporal mismatches and integration noise.
Through analysis and simulation, we show that learning depends on temporal
overlap: a synapse updates correctly only when its input and the corresponding
error signal coincide in time. When inputs are held constant, learning strength
declines linearly as the delay between input and error approaches the stimulus
duration, explaining observed robustness and failure across network depths.
Critically, robust learning requires the synaptic plasticity timescale to
exceed the stimulus duration by one to two orders of magnitude. For typical
cortical stimuli (tens of milliseconds), this places the functional plasticity
window in the few-second range, a testable prediction that identifies
seconds-scale eligibility traces as necessary for error-driven learning in
biological circuits.

Motivation: 探讨LRP在Transformer中的公理正确性及其与LOO的一致性。

Method: 分析AttnLRP的双线性传播规则，并测试CP-LRP绕过softmax层的效果。

Result: 双线性传播规则违反公理，CP-LRP在Transformer中后期层与LOO更一致。

Conclusion: 双线性因子敏感性和softmax传播误差可能共同影响LRP在Transformer中近似LOO的能力。

Abstract: Leave-One-Out (LOO) provides an intuitive measure of feature importance but
is computationally prohibitive. While Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation (LRP)
offers a potentially efficient alternative, its axiomatic soundness in modern
Transformers remains largely under-examined. In this work, we first show that
the bilinear propagation rules used in recent advances of AttnLRP violate the
implementation invariance axiom. We prove this analytically and confirm it
empirically in linear attention layers. Second, we also revisit CP-LRP as a
diagnostic baseline and find that bypassing relevance propagation through the
softmax layer -- backpropagating relevance only through the value matrices --
significantly improves alignment with LOO, particularly in middle-to-late
Transformer layers. Overall, our results suggest that (i) bilinear
factorization sensitivity and (ii) softmax propagation error potentially
jointly undermine LRP's ability to approximate LOO in Transformers.

Conclusion: ZO范式将大脑噪声转化为计算资源，不仅促进对自然智能的理解，还为神经形态硬件设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Iterative optimization is central to modern artificial intelligence (AI) and
provides a crucial framework for understanding adaptive systems. This review
provides a unified perspective on this subject, bridging classic theory with
neural network training and biological learning. Although gradient-based
methods, powered by the efficient but biologically implausible backpropagation
(BP), dominate machine learning, their computational demands can hinder
scalability in high-dimensional settings. In contrast, derivative-free or
zeroth-order (ZO) optimization feature computationally lighter approaches that
rely only on function evaluations and randomness. While generally less sample
efficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can
effectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP
in neural network models. This ZO paradigm is also particularly relevant for
biology. Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and
feedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological
learning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain
learns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based
on the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,
second-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how
these methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training
and the resulting learning dynamics. Finally, we build upon these insights to
view biological learning through an optimization lens, arguing that a ZO
paradigm leverages the brain's intrinsic noise as a computational resource.
This framework not only illuminates our understanding of natural intelligence
but also holds vast implications for neuromorphic hardware, helping us design
fast and energy-efficient AI systems that exploit intrinsic hardware noise.

Conclusion: OSFT为复杂奖励训练提供了高效替代，通过激活预训练潜在知识提升推理能力。

Abstract: We present a simple, self-help online supervised finetuning (OSFT) paradigm
for LLM reasoning. In this paradigm, the model generates its own responses and
is immediately finetuned on this self-generated data. OSFT is a highly
efficient training strategy for LLM reasoning, as it is reward-free and uses
just one rollout by default. Experiment results show that OSFT achieves
downstream performance on challenging mathematical reasoning tasks comparable
to strong reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) methods such as
GRPO. Our ablation study further demonstrates the efficiency and robustness of
OSFT. The major mechanism of OSFT lies in facilitating the model's own existing
preference (latent knowledge) learned from pretraining, which leads to
reasoning ability improvement. We believe that OSFT offers an efficient and
promising alternative to more complex, reward-based training paradigms. Our
code is available at https://github.com/ElementQi/OnlineSFT.

Result: 实验表明SSP能显著提升搜索代理性能，无需监督。

Conclusion: SSP是一种高效且可扩展的RLVR方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become the
mainstream technique for training LLM agents. However, RLVR highly depends on
well-crafted task queries and corresponding ground-truth answers to provide
accurate rewards, which requires massive human efforts and hinders the RL
scaling processes, especially under agentic scenarios. Although a few recent
works explore task synthesis methods, the difficulty of generated agentic tasks
can hardly be controlled to provide effective RL training advantages. To
achieve agentic RLVR with higher scalability, we explore self-play training for
deep search agents, in which the learning LLM utilizes multi-turn search engine
calling and acts simultaneously as both a task proposer and a problem solver.
The task proposer aims to generate deep search queries with well-defined
ground-truth answers and increasing task difficulty. The problem solver tries
to handle the generated search queries and output the correct answer
predictions. To ensure that each generated search query has accurate ground
truth, we collect all the searching results from the proposer's trajectory as
external knowledge, then conduct retrieval-augmentation generation (RAG) to
test whether the proposed query can be correctly answered with all necessary
search documents provided. In this search self-play (SSP) game, the proposer
and the solver co-evolve their agent capabilities through both competition and
cooperation. With substantial experimental results, we find that SSP can
significantly improve search agents' performance uniformly on various
benchmarks without any supervision under both from-scratch and continuous RL
training setups. The code is at https://github.com/Alibaba-Quark/SSP.

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{BO4Mob}, a new benchmark framework for high-dimensional
Bayesian Optimization (BO), driven by the challenge of origin-destination (OD)
travel demand estimation in large urban road networks. Estimating OD travel
demand from limited traffic sensor data is a difficult inverse optimization
problem, particularly in real-world, large-scale transportation networks. This
problem involves optimizing over high-dimensional continuous spaces where each
objective evaluation is computationally expensive, stochastic, and
non-differentiable. BO4Mob comprises five scenarios based on real-world San
Jose, CA road networks, with input dimensions scaling up to 10,100. These
scenarios utilize high-resolution, open-source traffic simulations that
incorporate realistic nonlinear and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate the
benchmark's utility by evaluating five optimization methods: three
state-of-the-art BO algorithms and two non-BO baselines. This benchmark is
designed to support both the development of scalable optimization algorithms
and their application for the design of data-driven urban mobility models,

Abstract: Value-based algorithms are a cornerstone of off-policy reinforcement learning
due to their simplicity and training stability. However, their use has
traditionally been restricted to discrete action spaces, as they rely on
estimating Q-values for individual state-action pairs. In continuous action
spaces, evaluating the Q-value over the entire action space becomes
computationally infeasible. To address this, actor-critic methods are typically
employed, where a critic is trained on off-policy data to estimate Q-values,
and an actor is trained to maximize the critic's output. Despite their
popularity, these methods often suffer from instability during training. In
this work, we propose a purely value-based framework for continuous control
that revisits structural maximization of Q-functions, introducing a set of key
architectural and algorithmic choices to enable efficient and stable learning.
We evaluate the proposed actor-free Q-learning approach on a range of standard
simulation tasks, demonstrating performance and sample efficiency on par with
state-of-the-art baselines, without the cost of learning a separate actor.
Particularly, in environments with constrained action spaces, where the value
functions are typically non-smooth, our method with structural maximization
outperforms traditional actor-critic methods with gradient-based maximization.

Abstract: Counterfactual inference provides a mathematical framework for reasoning
about hypothetical outcomes under alternative interventions, bridging causal
reasoning and predictive modeling. We present a counterfactual inference
framework for individualized risk estimation and intervention analysis,
illustrated through a clinical application to post-acute sequelae of COVID-19
(PASC) among patients with pre-existing heart failure (HF). Using longitudinal
diagnosis, laboratory, and medication data from a large health-system cohort,
we integrate regularized predictive modeling with counterfactual search to
identify actionable pathways to PASC-related HF hospital admissions. The
framework combines exact enumeration with optimization-based methods, including
the Nearest Instance Counterfactual Explanations (NICE) and Multi-Objective
Counterfactuals (MOC) algorithms, to efficiently explore high-dimensional
intervention spaces. Applied to more than 2700 individuals with confirmed
SARS-CoV-2 infection and prior HF, the model achieved strong discriminative
performance (AUROC: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.84-0.91) and generated interpretable,
patient-specific counterfactuals that quantify how modifying comorbidity
patterns or treatment factors could alter predicted outcomes. This work
demonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization
problem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and
computationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex
biomedical systems.

TL;DR: RL比SFT在语言模型后训练中表现更好，遗忘更少，且效率更高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在后训练中减少语言模型的能力退化（灾难性遗忘）。

Method: 比较监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的遗忘模式，并通过简化模型分析原因。

Result: RL在保持目标任务性能的同时，遗忘更少，且使用近似策略数据也能有效缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: RL的鲁棒性源于其使用策略内数据，为高效后训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: Adapting language models (LMs) to new tasks via post-training carries the
risk of degrading existing capabilities -- a phenomenon classically known as
catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for
mitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns
of two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
reinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across
LM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,
and arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving
comparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this
difference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a
mixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the
other to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which
stems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact
when learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating
that the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in
practical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL
regularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our
results highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately
on-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully
on-policy data.

TL;DR: 研究通过虚拟现实实验评估机器人干预校园枪击事件的潜力，发现高干扰策略显著减少受害者数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器人在高风险场景中的干预潜力，尤其是如何通过干扰枪手行为提升校园安全。

Method: 150名大学生在虚拟现实中扮演枪手，机器人通过预测枪手行动并采取不同干扰策略（主动/被动，低/中/高干扰）进行干预。

Result: 主动且高干扰的机器人策略使受害者数量减少46.6%。

Conclusion: 机器人干预在提升校园安全方面具有潜力，但其使用也引发伦理问题。

Abstract: We advance the understanding of robotic intervention in high-risk scenarios
by examining their potential to distract and impede a school shooter. To
evaluate this concept, we conducted a virtual reality study with 150 university
participants role-playing as a school shooter. Within the simulation, an
autonomous robot predicted the shooter's movements and positioned itself
strategically to interfere and distract. The strategy the robot used to
approach the shooter was manipulated -- either moving directly in front of the
shooter (aggressive) or maintaining distance (passive) -- and the distraction
method, ranging from no additional cues (low), to siren and lights (medium), to
siren, lights, and smoke to impair visibility (high). An aggressive,
high-distraction robot reduced the number of victims by 46.6% relative to a
no-robot control. This outcome underscores both the potential of robotic
intervention to enhance safety and the pressing ethical questions surrounding
their use in school environments.

Abstract: We present a reinforcement learning framework for autonomous goalkeeping with
humanoid robots in real-world scenarios. While prior work has demonstrated
similar capabilities on quadrupedal platforms, humanoid goalkeeping introduces
two critical challenges: (1) generating natural, human-like whole-body motions,
and (2) covering a wider guarding range with an equivalent response time.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on separate teleoperation or fixed motion
tracking for whole-body control, our method learns a single end-to-end RL
policy, enabling fully autonomous, highly dynamic, and human-like robot-object
interactions. To achieve this, we integrate multiple human motion priors
conditioned on perceptual inputs into the RL training via an adversarial
scheme. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through real-world
experiments, where the humanoid robot successfully performs agile, autonomous,
and naturalistic interceptions of fast-moving balls. In addition to
goalkeeping, we demonstrate the generalization of our approach through tasks
such as ball escaping and grabbing. Our work presents a practical and scalable
solution for enabling highly dynamic interactions between robots and moving
objects, advancing the field toward more adaptive and lifelike robotic
behaviors.

Result: 算法在模拟中展示了灵活性、适应性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了高维流形上的多机器人协调问题，避免了复杂计算。

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of multi-robot navigation where robots
maneuver on a desired \(m\)-dimensional (i.e., \(m\)-D) manifold in the
$n$-dimensional Euclidean space, and maintain a {\it flexible spatial
ordering}. We consider $ m\geq 2$, and the multi-robot coordination is achieved
via non-Euclidean metrics. However, since the $m$-D manifold can be
characterized by the zero-level sets of $n$ implicit functions, the last $m$
entries of the GVF propagation term become {\it strongly coupled} with the
partial derivatives of these functions if the auxiliary vectors are not
appropriately chosen. These couplings not only influence the on-manifold
maneuvering of robots, but also pose significant challenges to the further
design of the ordering-flexible coordination via non-Euclidean metrics.
  To tackle this issue, we first identify a feasible solution of auxiliary
vectors such that the last $m$ entries of the propagation term are effectively
decoupled to be the same constant. Then, we redesign the coordinated GVF (CGVF)
algorithm to {\it boost} the advantages of singularities elimination and global
convergence by treating $m$ manifold parameters as additional $m$ virtual
coordinates. Furthermore, we enable the on-manifold ordering-flexible motion
coordination by allowing each robot to share $m$ virtual coordinates with its
time-varying neighbors and a virtual target robot, which {\it circumvents} the
possible complex calculation if Euclidean metrics were used instead. Finally,
we showcase the proposed algorithm's flexibility, adaptability, and robustness
through extensive simulations with different initial positions,
higher-dimensional manifolds, and robot breakdown, respectively.

Conclusion: R2BC是一种高效的单人类训练多机器人系统的方法，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Imitation Learning (IL) is a natural way for humans to teach robots,
particularly when high-quality demonstrations are easy to obtain. While IL has
been widely applied to single-robot settings, relatively few studies have
addressed the extension of these methods to multi-agent systems, especially in
settings where a single human must provide demonstrations to a team of
collaborating robots. In this paper, we introduce and study Round-Robin
Behavior Cloning (R2BC), a method that enables a single human operator to
effectively train multi-robot systems through sequential, single-agent
demonstrations. Our approach allows the human to teleoperate one agent at a
time and incrementally teach multi-agent behavior to the entire system, without
requiring demonstrations in the joint multi-agent action space. We show that
R2BC methods match, and in some cases surpass, the performance of an oracle
behavior cloning approach trained on privileged synchronized demonstrations
across four multi-agent simulated tasks. Finally, we deploy R2BC on two
physical robot tasks trained using real human demonstrations.

Result: 实验显示对番茄采摘的即时损伤率为0%，五天后瘀伤率低于9%。

Conclusion: 该夹持器适合水果采摘，兼具高效性和保护性。

Abstract: Fruit harvesting remains predominantly a labor-intensive process, motivating
the development of research for robotic grippers. Conventional rigid or
vacuum-driven grippers require complex mechanical design or high energy
consumption. Current enveloping-based fruit harvesting grippers lack
adaptability to fruits of different sizes. This paper introduces a
drawstring-inspired, cable-driven soft gripper for versatile and gentle fruit
harvesting. The design employs 3D-printed Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU)
pockets with integrated steel wires that constrict around the fruit when
actuated, distributing pressure uniformly to minimize bruising and allow
versatility to fruits of varying sizes. The lightweight structure, which
requires few components, reduces mechanical complexity and cost compared to
other grippers. Actuation is achieved through servo-driven cable control, while
motor feedback provides autonomous grip adjustment with tunable grip strength.
Experimental validation shows that, for tomatoes within the gripper's effective
size range, harvesting was achieved with a 0% immediate damage rate and a
bruising rate of less than 9% after five days, reinforcing the gripper's
suitability for fruit harvesting.

Result: 筛选后的数据集能提升学习效果，且学习过程更确定；少量但信息丰富的数据加速学习。

Conclusion: 接触感知度量可用于指导接触数据筛选，优化机器人学习。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the utility of datasets and whether more data
or the 'right' data is advantageous for robot learning. In particular, we are
interested on quantifying the utility of contact-based data as contact holds
significant information for robot learning. Our approach derives a
contact-aware objective function for learning object dynamics and shape from
pose and contact data. We show that the contact-aware Fisher-information metric
can be used to rank and curate contact-data based on how informative data is
for learning. In addition, we find that selecting a reduced dataset based on
this ranking improves the learning task while also making learning a
deterministic process. Interestingly, our results show that more data is not
necessarily advantageous, and rather, less but informative data can accelerate
learning, especially depending on the contact interactions. Last, we show how
our metric can be used to provide initial guidance on data curation for
contact-based robot learning.

Conclusion: MoMaGen为移动双手机器人操作提供了一种高效的数据生成方法，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven
effective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and
time-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile
manipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two
high-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have
addressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations
in simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key
challenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)
positioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor
policies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data
generation as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints
(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during
navigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a
principled foundation for future methods. We evaluate MoMaGen on four
multi-step bimanual mobile manipulation tasks and show that it generates
significantly more diverse datasets than existing methods. Leveraging this
diversity, MoMaGen can train successful imitation learning policies from a
single source demonstration, and these policies can be fine-tuned with as few
as 40 real-world demonstrations to achieve deployment on physical robotic
hardware. More details are available at our project page: momagen.github.io.

Conclusion: MoTVLA在推理速度和任务性能上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Integrating visual-language instructions into visuomotor policies is gaining
momentum in robot learning for enhancing open-world generalization. Despite
promising advances, existing approaches face two challenges: limited language
steerability when no generated reasoning is used as a condition, or significant
inference latency when reasoning is incorporated.In this work, we introduce
MoTVLA, a mixture-of-transformers (MoT)-based vision-language-action (VLA)
model that integrates fast-slow unified reasoning with behavior policy
learning. MoTVLA preserves the general intelligence of pre-trained VLMs
(serving as the generalist) for tasks such as perception, scene understanding,
and semantic planning, while incorporating a domain expert, a second
transformer that shares knowledge with the pretrained VLM, to generate
domain-specific fast reasoning (e.g., robot motion decomposition), thereby
improving policy execution efficiency. By conditioning the action expert on
decomposed motion instructions, MoTVLA can learn diverse behaviors and
substantially improve language steerability. Extensive evaluations across
natural language processing benchmarks, robotic simulation environments, and
real-world experiments confirm the superiority of MoTVLA in both fast-slow
reasoning and manipulation task performance.

Motivation: 高质量3D重建需要多视角捕捉关键点图像，而覆盖控制框架能有效满足这一需求。

Method: 通过基于二次规划的覆盖控制器协调无人机运动，实时处理图像生成3D网格，并利用网格变化作为反馈更新覆盖控制的重要性指标。

Result: 实验验证了Coverage-Recon在完整性和准确性上优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 在线地图反馈显著提升了3D重建的质量。

Abstract: This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple
drones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of
keypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage
control offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,
recent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to
render an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide
drone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated
image sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve
reconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of
drones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage
controller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety
constraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon
algorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are
interpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback
to update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The
effectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and
experiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that
incorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D
reconstructions than conventional methods. Project page:

Motivation: 现有感知强化学习方法要么限制了动作空间并降低了适应性，要么缺乏前瞻性导致对噪声敏感。PGTT旨在克服这些限制。

Result: PGTT在模拟和真实机器人实验中表现出更高的成功率和更快的收敛速度。

Conclusion: PGTT证明了基于相位的奖励塑造是一种简单且通用的方法，适用于不同机器人平台的鲁棒感知运动。

Abstract: State-of-the-art perceptive Reinforcement Learning controllers for legged
robots either (i) impose oscillator or IK-based gait priors that constrain the
action space, add bias to the policy optimization and reduce adaptability
across robot morphologies, or (ii) operate "blind", which struggle to
anticipate hind-leg terrain, and are brittle to noise. In this paper, we
propose Phase-Guided Terrain Traversal (PGTT), a perception-aware deep-RL
approach that overcomes these limitations by enforcing gait structure purely
through reward shaping, thereby reducing inductive bias in policy learning
compared to oscillator/IK-conditioned action priors. PGTT encodes per-leg phase
as a cubic Hermite spline that adapts swing height to local heightmap
statistics and adds a swing- phase contact penalty, while the policy acts
directly in joint space supporting morphology-agnostic deployment. Trained in
MuJoCo (MJX) on procedurally generated stair-like terrains with curriculum and
domain randomization, PGTT achieves the highest success under push disturbances
(median +7.5% vs. the next best method) and on discrete obstacles (+9%), with
comparable velocity tracking, and converging to an effective policy roughly 2x
faster than strong end-to-end baselines. We validate PGTT on a Unitree Go2
using a real-time LiDAR elevation-to-heightmap pipeline, and we report
preliminary results on ANYmal-C obtained with the same hyperparameters. These
findings indicate that terrain-adaptive, phase-guided reward shaping is a
simple and general mechanism for robust perceptive locomotion across platforms.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统验证需要在测试保真度、成本和可扩展性之间权衡，现有小型化HIL平台缺乏系统性定量分析框架。

Method: 提出MMRHP平台，采用三阶段测试流程和统一时空测量核心设计，支持SOTIF标准。

Result: 平台空间精度达10.27 mm RMSE，闭环延迟约45 ms；Autoware案例发现40 ms延迟下的性能临界点。

Conclusion: 结构化流程与统一时空基准平台结合，可实现自动驾驶系统的可重复定量评估。

Abstract: Validation of autonomous driving systems requires a trade-off between test
fidelity, cost, and scalability. While miniaturized hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
platforms have emerged as a promising solution, a systematic framework
supporting rigorous quantitative analysis is generally lacking, limiting their
value as scientific evaluation tools. To address this challenge, we propose
MMRHP, a miniature mixed-reality HIL platform that elevates miniaturized
testing from functional demonstration to rigorous, reproducible quantitative
analysis. The core contributions are threefold. First, we propose a systematic
three-phase testing process oriented toward the Safety of the Intended
Functionality(SOTIF)standard, providing actionable guidance for identifying the
performance limits and triggering conditions of otherwise correctly functioning
systems. Second, we design and implement a HIL platform centered around a
unified spatiotemporal measurement core to support this process, ensuring
consistent and traceable quantification of physical motion and system timing.
Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this solution through
comprehensive experiments. The platform itself was first validated, achieving a
spatial accuracy of 10.27 mm RMSE and a stable closed-loop latency baseline of
approximately 45 ms. Subsequently, an in-depth Autoware case study leveraged
this validated platform to quantify its performance baseline and identify a
critical performance cliff at an injected latency of 40 ms. This work shows
that a structured process, combined with a platform offering a unified
spatio-temporal benchmark, enables reproducible, interpretable, and
quantitative closed-loop evaluation of autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for real-time human action recognition
in industrial contexts, using standard 2D cameras. We introduce a complete
pipeline for robust and real-time estimation of human joint kinematics, input
to a temporally smoothed Transformer-based network, for action recognition. We
rely on a new dataset including 11 subjects performing various actions, to
evaluate our approach. Unlike most of the literature that relies on joint
center positions (JCP) and is offline, ours uses biomechanical prior, eg. joint
angles, for fast and robust real-time recognition. Besides, joint angles make
the proposed method agnostic to sensor and subject poses as well as to
anthropometric differences, and ensure robustness across environments and
subjects. Our proposed learning model outperforms the best baseline model,
running also in real-time, along various metrics. It achieves 88% accuracy and
shows great generalization ability, for subjects not facing the cameras.
Finally, we demonstrate the robustness and usefulness of our technique, through
an online interaction experiment, with a simulated robot controlled in
real-time via the recognized actions.

Abstract: Motivated by the application of using model predictive control (MPC) for
motion planning of autonomous mobile robots, a form of output tracking MPC for
non- holonomic systems and with non-convex constraints is studied. Although the
advantages of using MPC for motion planning have been demonstrated in several
papers, in most of the available fundamental literature on output tracking MPC
it is assumed, often implicitly, that the model is holonomic and generally the
state or output constraints must be convex. Thus, in application-oriented
publications, empirical results dominate and the topic of proving completeness,
in particular under which assumptions the target is always reached, has
received comparatively little attention. To address this gap, we present a
novel MPC formulation that guarantees convergence to the desired target under
realistic assumptions, which can be verified in relevant real-world scenarios.

Abstract: We present an online model-based reinforcement learning algorithm suitable
for controlling complex robotic systems directly in the real world. Unlike
prevailing sim-to-real pipelines that rely on extensive offline simulation and
model-free policy optimization, our method builds a dynamics model from
real-time interaction data and performs policy updates guided by the learned
dynamics model. This efficient model-based reinforcement learning scheme
significantly reduces the number of samples to train control policies, enabling
direct training on real-world rollout data. This significantly reduces the
influence of bias in the simulated data, and facilitates the search for
high-performance control policies. We adopt online learning analysis to derive
sublinear regret bounds under standard stochastic online optimization
assumptions, providing formal guarantees on performance improvement as more
interaction data are collected. Experimental evaluations were performed on a
hydraulic excavator arm and a soft robot arm, where the algorithm demonstrates
strong sample efficiency compared to model-free reinforcement learning methods,
reaching comparable performance within hours. Robust adaptation to shifting
dynamics was also observed when the payload condition was randomized. Our
approach paves the way toward efficient and reliable on-robot learning for a
broad class of challenging control tasks.

TL;DR: EfficientNav 是一种基于小型 LLM 的零样本目标导航方法，通过语义感知内存检索和离散内存缓存优化，显著提升了成功率和降低了延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖云端大型 LLM（如 GPT-4），而直接使用小型 LLM（如 LLaMA3.2-11b）会导致成功率下降和高延迟，限制了本地设备的部署。

Method: 提出语义感知内存检索以精简导航地图信息，并采用离散内存缓存和基于注意力的内存聚类来优化 KV 缓存。

Result: 在 HM3D 基准测试中，EfficientNav 比 GPT-4 基线成功率提升 11.1%，实时延迟降低 6.7 倍，端到端延迟降低 4.7 倍。

Conclusion: EfficientNav 实现了高效、低延迟的本地设备部署，为小型 LLM 在目标导航任务中的应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Object-goal navigation (ObjNav) tasks an agent with navigating to the
location of a specific object in an unseen environment. Embodied agents
equipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation
maps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily
rely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small
LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to
limited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which
prevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt
introduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency
on local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device
efficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better
understand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to
prune redundant information in navigation maps. To reduce planning latency, we
propose discrete memory caching and attention-based memory clustering to
efficiently save and re-use the KV cache. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate that EfficientNav achieves 11.1% improvement in success rate on
HM3D benchmark over GPT-4-based baselines, and demonstrates 6.7x real-time
latency reduction and 4.7x end-to-end latency reduction over GPT-4 planner. Our
code will be released soon.

unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), called Flexbee, which features a soft
vector-propulsion nozzle (SVPN). Compared to previous UAVs, Flexbee integrates
flight, grasping, and perching functionalities into the four SVPNs. This

nonlinear coupling issue of the moment has been resolved through linearization
of the equivalent moment model. A hierarchical control strategy was used to
design controllers for the two operational modes of Flexbee. Finally, flight,
grasping, and perching experiments were conducted to validate Flexbee's
kinematic capabilities and the effectiveness of the control strategy.

Abstract: Missions such as the Ingenuity helicopter have shown the advantages of using
novel locomotion modes to increase the scientific return of planetary
exploration missions. Legged robots can further expand the reach and capability
of future planetary missions by traversing more difficult terrain than wheeled
rovers, such as jumping over cracks on the ground or traversing rugged terrain
with boulders. To develop and test algorithms for using quadruped robots, the
AAPLE project was carried out at DFKI. As part of the project, we conducted a
series of field experiments on the Volcano on the Aeolian island of Vulcano, an
active stratovolcano near Sicily, Italy. The experiments focused on validating
newly developed state-of-the-art adaptive optimal control algorithms for
quadrupedal locomotion in a high-fidelity analog environment for Lunar and
Martian surfaces. This paper presents the technical approach, test plan,
software architecture, field deployment strategy, and evaluation results from
the Vulcano campaign.

*Mattias Trende,Petter Ögren*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种优化控制屏障函数（CBF）和安全的控制动作组合的方法，以减少保守性约束的影响，同时保持安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的CBF方法在处理复杂不安全区域时往往需要保守近似，限制了控制动作的自由度。

Method: 通过联合优化CBF和安全的控制动作，提出了一种称为最小限制性超平面CBF的方法，并提供了平滑参数化方案。

Result: 在双积分器动态系统中验证了方法的有效性，能够处理任意形状的静态和动态障碍物。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持安全性的同时，显著减少了保守性约束对控制动作的限制。

Abstract: Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) can provide provable safety guarantees for
dynamic systems. However, finding a valid CBF for a system of interest is often
non-trivial, especially if the shape of the unsafe region is complex and the
CBFs are of higher order. A common solution to this problem is to make a
conservative approximation of the unsafe region in the form of a
line/hyperplane, and use the corresponding conservative Hyperplane-CBF when
deciding on safe control actions. In this letter, we note that conservative
constraints are only a problem if they prevent us from doing what we want.
Thus, instead of first choosing a CBF and then choosing a safe control with
respect to the CBF, we optimize over a combination of CBFs and safe controls to
get as close as possible to our desired control, while still having the safety
guarantee provided by the CBF. We call the corresponding CBF the least
restrictive Hyperplane-CBF. Finally, we also provide a way of creating a smooth
parameterization of the CBF-family for the optimization, and illustrate the
approach on a double integrator dynamical system with acceleration constraints,
moving through a group of arbitrarily shaped static and moving obstacles.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统腿式运动在松散和倾斜地形上可能效率低且危险，需要研究更高效的运动策略。

Method: 结合Isaac Sim的物理模拟和ANSYS-Rocky的粒子交互验证，比较行走与滑动的CoT。

Result: 初步确定了行走与滑动CoT曲线的交点，为自适应运动策略提供基础。

Conclusion: 研究为行星腿式探测器的自适应运动策略迈出了第一步。

Abstract: Legged rovers provide enhanced mobility compared to wheeled platforms,
enabling navigation on steep and irregular planetary terrains. However,
traditional legged locomotion might be energetically inefficient and
potentially dangerous to the rover on loose and inclined surfaces, such as
crater walls and cave slopes. This paper introduces a preliminary study that
compares the Cost of Transport (CoT) of walking and torso-based sliding
locomotion for quadruped robots across different slopes, friction conditions
and speed levels. By identifying intersections between walking and sliding CoT
curves, we aim to define threshold conditions that may trigger transitions
between the two strategies. The methodology combines physics-based simulations
in Isaac Sim with particle interaction validation in ANSYS-Rocky. Our results
represent an initial step towards adaptive locomotion strategies for planetary
legged rovers.

Conclusion: EGG框架有效连接了空间特征与动态事件，为机器人智能辅助提供了新工具。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect for building intelligent autonomous robots that can
assist humans in their daily lives is the construction of rich environmental
representations. While advances in semantic scene representations have enriched
robotic scene understanding, current approaches lack a connection between
spatial features and dynamic events; e.g., connecting the blue mug to the event
washing a mug. In this work, we introduce the event-grounding graph (EGG), a
framework grounding event interactions to spatial features of a scene. This
representation allows robots to perceive, reason, and respond to complex
spatio-temporal queries. Experiments using real robotic data demonstrate EGG's
capability to retrieve relevant information and respond accurately to human
inquiries concerning the environment and events within. Furthermore, the EGG
framework's source code and evaluation dataset are released as open-source at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自主货物运输中，多车团队比单一大车更具操作灵活性，但需要高精度的车辆间距离和路径跟踪。

Method: 采用分布式MPC，基于激光雷达的精确路径跟踪技术，通过共享地图实现车辆间的相对定位。

Conclusion: 分布式MPC提供了计算分布的操作灵活性，适用于实际部署，能够满足高精度的货物运输需求。

Abstract: For autonomous cargo transportation, teams of mobile robots can provide more
operational flexibility than a single large robot. In these scenarios,
precision in both inter-vehicle distance and path tracking is key. With this
motivation, we develop a distributed model-predictive controller (MPC) for
multi-vehicle cargo operations that builds on the precise path-tracking of
lidar teach and repeat. To carry cargo, a following vehicle must maintain a
Euclidean distance offset from a lead vehicle regardless of the path curvature.
Our approach uses a shared map to localize the robots relative to each other
without GNSS or direct observations. We compare our approach to a centralized
MPC and a baseline approach that directly measures the inter-vehicle distance.
The distributed MPC shows equivalent nominal performance to the more complex
centralized MPC. Using a direct measurement of the relative distance between
the leader and follower shows improved tracking performance in close-range
scenarios but struggles with long-range offsets. The operational flexibility
provided by distributing the computation makes it well suited for real
deployments. We evaluate four types of convoyed path trackers with over 10 km
of driving in a coupled convoy. With convoys of two and three rovers, the
proposed distributed MPC method works in real-time to allow map-based convoying
to maintain maximum spacing within 20 cm of the target in various conditions.

Result: 输出紧凑的对象层，可查询类别、姿态和置信度，并与占用地图集成，供规划器使用。

Conclusion: 系统在机器人测试中表现出稳定性，能够适应视角变化。

Abstract: We present an online semantic object mapping system for a quadruped robot
operating in real indoor environments, turning sensor detections into named
objects in a global map. During a run, the mapper integrates range geometry
with camera detections, merges co-located detections within a frame, and
associates repeated detections into persistent object instances across frames.
Objects remain in the map when they are out of view, and repeated sightings
update the same instance rather than creating duplicates. The output is a
compact object layer that can be queried (class, pose, and confidence), is
integrated with the occupancy map and readable by a planner. In on-robot tests,
the layer remained stable across viewpoint changes.

Conclusion: MADR为高维对抗性零和博弈提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于复杂动态系统。

Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability offers a framework for generating safe
value functions and policies in the face of adversarial disturbance, but is
limited by the curse of dimensionality. Physics-informed deep learning is able
to overcome this infeasibility, but itself suffers from slow and inaccurate
convergence, primarily due to weak PDE gradients and the complexity of
self-supervised learning. A few works, recently, have demonstrated that
enriching the self-supervision process with regular supervision (based on the
nature of the optimal control problem), greatly accelerates convergence and
solution quality, however, these have been limited to single player problems
and simple games. In this work, we introduce MADR: MPC-guided Adversarial
DeepReach, a general framework to robustly approximate the two-player, zero-sum
differential game value function. In doing so, MADR yields the corresponding
optimal strategies for both players in zero-sum games as well as safe policies
for worst-case robustness. We test MADR on a multitude of high-dimensional
simulated and real robotic agents with varying dynamics and games, finding that
our approach significantly out-performs state-of-the-art baselines in
simulation and produces impressive results in hardware.
