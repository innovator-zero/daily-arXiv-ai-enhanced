The first four authors contribute\n  equally", "summary": "Imitation learning from large-scale, diverse human demonstrations has proven\neffective for training robots, but collecting such data is costly and\ntime-consuming. This challenge is amplified for multi-step bimanual mobile\nmanipulation, where humans must teleoperate both a mobile base and two\nhigh-degree-of-freedom arms. Prior automated data generation frameworks have\naddressed static bimanual manipulation by augmenting a few human demonstrations\nin simulation, but they fall short for mobile settings due to two key\nchallenges: (1) determining base placement to ensure reachability, and (2)\npositioning the camera to provide sufficient visibility for visuomotor\npolicies. To address these issues, we introduce MoMaGen, which formulates data\ngeneration as a constrained optimization problem that enforces hard constraints\n(e.g., reachability) while balancing soft constraints (e.g., visibility during\nnavigation). This formulation generalizes prior approaches and provides a\nprincipled foundation for future methods.

In this work, we\nevaluate the results of three different segmentation models (UNesT, nnU-Net,\nand CoTr) and a traditional atlas-based method (ANTs), applied to segment the\nleft and right nucleus accumbens (NAc) in MRI images. We utilize a dataset\nincluding four demographic subgroups: black female, black male, white female,\nand white male. We employ manually labeled gold-standard segmentations to train\nand test segmentation models. This study consists of two parts: the first\nassesses the segmentation performance of models, while the second measures the\nvolumes they produce to evaluate the effects of race, sex, and their\ninteraction. Fairness is quantitatively measured using a metric designed to\nquantify fairness in segmentation performance. Additionally, linear mixed\nmodels analyze the impact of demographic variables on segmentation accuracy and\nderived volumes. Training on the same race as the test subjects leads to\nsignificantly better segmentation accuracy for some models.

Project page: https://htnk-lab.github.io/coverage-recon/", "summary": "This article addresses collaborative 3D map reconstruction using multiple\ndrones. Achieving high-quality reconstruction requires capturing images of\nkeypoints within the target scene from diverse viewing angles, and coverage\ncontrol offers an effective framework to meet this requirement. Meanwhile,\nrecent advances in real-time 3D reconstruction algorithms make it possible to\nrender an evolving map during flight, enabling immediate feedback to guide\ndrone motion. Building on this, we present Coverage-Recon, a novel coordinated\nimage sampling algorithm that integrates online map feedback to improve\nreconstruction quality on-the-fly. In Coverage-Recon, the coordinated motion of\ndrones is governed by a Quadratic Programming (QP)-based angle-aware coverage\ncontroller, which ensures multi-viewpoint image capture while enforcing safety\nconstraints. The captured images are processed in real time by the NeuralRecon\nalgorithm to generate an evolving 3D mesh. Mesh changes across the scene are\ninterpreted as indicators of reconstruction uncertainty and serve as feedback\nto update the importance index of the coverage control as the map evolves. The\neffectiveness of Coverage-Recon is validated through simulation and\nexperiments, demonstrating both qualitatively and quantitatively that\nincorporating online map feedback yields more complete and accurate 3D\nreconstructions than conventional methods.

There are two main\nparadigms in FL: Horizontal FL (HFL), where all participant nodes share the\nsame feature space but hold different samples, and Vertical FL (VFL), where\nparticipants hold complementary features for the same samples. While HFL is\nwidely adopted, VFL is employed in domains where nodes hold complementary\nfeatures about the same samples. Still, VFL presents a significant limitation:\nthe vast number of communications required during training. This compromises\nprivacy and security, and can lead to high energy consumption, and in some\ncases, make model training unfeasible due to the high number of communications.\n  In this paper, we introduce Sherpa.ai Blind Vertical Federated Learning\n(SBVFL), a novel paradigm that leverages a distributed training mechanism\nenhanced for privacy and security.

However, current RL\nmethods face a fundamental scalability bottleneck due to their heavy reliance\non human-curated preference data or labeled datasets for reward modeling. To\novercome this limitation, we explore RL on unlabeled data where models learn\nautonomously from continuous experience streams. The core challenge in this\nsetting lies in reliable reward estimation without ground-truth supervision.\nExisting approaches like Test-Time RL address this through self-consistent\nconsensus, but risk reinforcing incorrect pseudo-labels derived from majority\nvoting. We introduce COMPASS (Composite Path and Answer Self-Scoring), a novel\ntest-time reward mechanism that operates without external supervision.

Embodied agents\nequipped with large language models (LLMs) and online constructed navigation\nmaps can perform ObjNav in a zero-shot manner. However, existing agents heavily\nrely on giant LLMs on the cloud, e.g., GPT-4, while directly switching to small\nLLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-11b, suffer from significant success rate drops due to\nlimited model capacity for understanding complex navigation maps, which\nprevents deploying ObjNav on local devices. At the same time, the long prompt\nintroduced by the navigation map description will cause high planning latency\non local devices. In this paper, we propose EfficientNav to enable on-device\nefficient LLM-based zero-shot ObjNav. To help the smaller LLMs better\nunderstand the environment, we propose semantics-aware memory retrieval to\nprune redundant information in navigation maps.

This work answers the question of when and\nwhy TM outperforms FM. First, when the target is a unimodal Gaussian\ndistribution, we prove that TM attains strictly lower KL divergence than FM for\nfinite number of steps. The improvement arises from stochastic difference\nlatent updates in TM, which preserve target covariance that deterministic FM\nunderestimates. We then characterize convergence rates, showing that TM\nachieves faster convergence than FM under a fixed compute budget, establishing\nits advantage in the unimodal Gaussian setting. Second, we extend the analysis\nto Gaussian mixtures and identify local-unimodality regimes in which the\nsampling dynamics approximate the unimodal case, where TM can outperform FM.\nThe approximation error decreases as the minimal distance between component\nmeans increases, highlighting that TM is favored when the modes are well\nseparated. However, when the target variance approaches zero, each TM update\nconverges to the FM update, and the performance advantage of TM diminishes.

Existing\nneural operators and large-scale forecasters rely on dense, co-located\ninput-output fields and short temporal contexts, assumptions that fail in\nreal-world systems where sensing and prediction occur on distinct physical\nmanifolds and over long timescales. We introduce the Spatio-Temporal Operator\nNetwork (STONe), a non-autoregressive neural operator that learns a stable\nfunctional mapping between heterogeneous domains. By directly inferring\nhigh-altitude radiation dose fields from sparse ground-based neutron\nmeasurements, STONe demonstrates that operator learning can generalize beyond\nshared-domain settings. It defines a nonlinear operator between sensor and\ntarget manifolds that remains stable over long forecasting horizons without\niterative recurrence.

For example, we find\nthat instruction framing can reduce the over-blocking rate on borderline\ncontent from 62.4% to 10.4% in Gemini-1.5, but only at the cost of\nunder-refusing on unsafe content with refusal rate dropping from 90.8% to\n53.9%.

A common practical approach is to\naugment the RL policy with a safety filter that overrides unsafe actions to\nprevent failures during both training and deployment. However, safety filtering\nis often perceived as sacrificing performance and hindering the learning\nprocess. We show that this perceived safety-performance tradeoff is not\ninherent and prove, for the first time, that enforcing safety with a\nsufficiently permissive safety filter does not degrade asymptotic performance.\nWe formalize RL safety with a safety-critical Markov decision process (SC-MDP),\nwhich requires categorical, rather than high-probability, avoidance of\ncatastrophic failure states. Additionally, we define an associated filtered MDP\nin which all actions result in safe effects, thanks to a safety filter that is\nconsidered to be a part of the environment. Our main theorem establishes that\n(i) learning in the filtered MDP is safe categorically, (ii) standard RL\nconvergence carries over to the filtered MDP, and (iii) any policy that is\noptimal in the filtered MDP-when executed through the same filter-achieves the\nsame asymptotic return as the best safe policy in the SC-MDP, yielding a\ncomplete separation between safety enforcement and performance optimization. We\nvalidate the theory on Safety Gymnasium with representative tasks and\nconstraints, observing zero violations during training and final performance\nmatching or exceeding unfiltered baselines. Together, these results shed light\non a long-standing question in safety-filtered learning and provide a simple,\nprincipled recipe for safe RL: train and deploy RL policies with the most\npermissive safety filter that is available.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8db3\u591f\u5bbd\u677e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u4e0d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6b63\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08SC-MDP\uff09\u548c\u8fc7\u6ee4MDP\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728Safety Gymnasium\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u96f6\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u65e0\u8fc7\u6ee4\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5bbd\u677e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

Pruning is a widely\nused technique that prompts sparsity in model structures, e.g. weights,\nneurons, and layers, reducing size and inference costs. Structured pruning is\nespecially important as it allows for the removal of entire structures, which\nfurther accelerates inference time and reduces memory overhead. However, it can\nbe computationally expensive, requiring iterative retraining and optimization.\nTo overcome this problem, recent methods considered one-shot setting, which\napplies pruning directly at post-training. Unfortunately, they often lead to a\nconsiderable drop in performance. In this paper, we focus on this issue by\nproposing a novel one-shot pruning framework that relies on explainable deep\nlearning. First, we introduce a causal-aware pruning approach that leverages\ncause-effect relations between model predictions and structures in a\nprogressive pruning process. It allows us to efficiently reduce the size of the\nnetwork, ensuring that the removed structures do not deter the performance of\nthe model.

Recent progress in 2D generative models have enabled photorealistic\nediting of faces using simple techniques leveraging the compositionality in\nGANs. However, identity preserving editing for 3D faces with a given set of\nattributes is a challenging task as the generative model must reason about view\nconsistency from multiple poses and render a realistic 3D face.

Sparse autoencoders\n(SAEs) make hidden activations more interpretable by exposing latent features\nthat often align with human concepts. Yet, these features are fragile and\npassive, offering no mechanism for systematic reasoning or model control. To\naddress this, we introduce ActivationReasoning (AR), a framework that embeds\nexplicit logical reasoning into the latent space of LLMs. It proceeds in three\nstages: (1) Finding latent representations, first latent concept\nrepresentations are identified (e.g., via SAEs) and organized into a\ndictionary; (2) Activating propositions, at inference time AR detects\nactivating concepts and maps them to logical propositions; and (3)Logical\nreasoning, applying logical rules over these propositions to infer higher-order\nstructures, compose new concepts, and steer model behavior.

However, existing medical MLLMs rely\nsolely on internal knowledge during reasoning, leading to hallucinated\nreasoning and factual inaccuracies when encountering cases beyond their\ntraining scope. Although recent Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\nmethods elicit the medical model's proactive retrieval ability during\nreasoning, they are confined to unimodal LLMs, neglecting the crucial visual\ninformation during reasoning and retrieval. Consequently, we propose the first\nMultimodal Medical Reasoning-with-Retrieval framework, Med-RwR, which actively\nretrieves external knowledge by querying observed symptoms or domain-specific\nmedical concepts during reasoning.

Few-Shot Learning (FSL) provides a promising approach to data\nscarcity, yet current FSL research mainly relies on generic benchmark datasets\nlacking remote-sensing disaster imagery, limiting its practical effectiveness.\nMoreover, disaster images exhibit high intra-class variation and inter-class\nsimilarity, hindering the performance of conventional metric-based FSL methods.\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces the Attention-based\nBhattacharyya-Hellinger Feature Aggregation Network (ATTBHFA-Net), which\nlinearly combines the Bhattacharyya coefficient and Hellinger distances to\ncompare and aggregate feature probability distributions for robust prototype\nformation. The Bhattacharyya coefficient serves as a contrastive margin that\nenhances inter-class separability, while the Hellinger distance regularizes\nsame-class alignment. This framework parallels contrastive learning but\noperates over probability distributions rather than embedded feature points.\nFurthermore, a Bhattacharyya-Hellinger distance-based contrastive loss is\nproposed as a distributional counterpart to cosine similarity loss, used\njointly with categorical cross-entropy to significantly improve FSL\nperformance. Experiments on four FSL benchmarks and two disaster image datasets\ndemonstrate the superior effectiveness and generalization of ATTBHFA-Net\ncompared to existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684Bhattacharyya-Hellinger\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u5408\u7f51\u7edc\uff08ATTBHFA-Net\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u707e\u96be\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u707e\u96be\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u7c7b\u5185\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u548c\u7c7b\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u707e\u96be\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u5408Bhattacharyya\u7cfb\u6570\u548cHellinger\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u805a\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u707e\u96be\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cATTBHFA-Net\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ATTBHFA-Net\u4e3a\u707e\u96be\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002"}}

In this paper, we reveal and study a highly practical yet\nunder-explored problem in MMEA, termed Dual-level Noisy Correspondence (DNC).\nDNC refers to misalignments in both intra-entity (entity-attribute) and\ninter-graph (entity-entity and attribute-attribute) correspondences.

Existing ICA methods predominantly\nrely on hand-crafted or shallow convolutional neural network-based features of\na single visual modality, which are insufficient to fully capture the perceived\nrepresentations closely related to image complexity. Recently, cross-modal\nscene semantic information has been shown to play a crucial role in various\ncomputer vision tasks, particularly those involving perceptual understanding.\nHowever, the exploration of cross-modal scene semantic information in the\ncontext of ICA remains unaddressed. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel ICA method called Cross-Modal Scene Semantic Alignment (CM-SSA), which\nleverages scene semantic alignment from a cross-modal perspective to enhance\nICA performance, enabling complexity predictions to be more consistent with\nsubjective human perception. Specifically, the proposed CM-SSA consists of a\ncomplexity regression branch and a scene semantic alignment branch.

To select the binary mask, these methods minimize a robust loss by\nassigning an importance score to each weight, and then keep the weights with\nthe highest scores.

The objective of this study is to\nintroduce and validate a novel local surface representation method for the\nautomated and accurate diagnosis of AD. Methods: The study utilizes T1-weighted\nMRI scans from 160 participants (80 AD patients and 80 healthy controls) from\nthe Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Cortical surface models\nwere reconstructed from the MRI data using Freesurfer. Key geometric attributes\nwere computed from the 3D meshes. Area distortion and conformal factor were\nderived using Ricci flow for conformal parameterization, while Gaussian\ncurvature was calculated directly from the mesh geometry.

In this paper, we provide analyses of the policy\ngradient method for undiscounted expected total-reward infinite-horizon MDPs\nbased on two key insights: (i) the classification of the MDP states into\nrecurrent and transient states is invariant over the set of policies that\nassign strictly positive probability to every action (as is typical in deep RL\nmodels employing a softmax output layer) and (ii) the classical state\nvisitation measure (which may be ill-defined when $\\gamma = 1$) can be replaced\nwith a new object that we call the transient visitation measure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u603b\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6298\u6263\u56e0\u5b50\u03b3 < 1\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u671f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bRL\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u03b3 = 1\u7684\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06MDP\u72b6\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u77ac\u6001\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u77ac\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ea6\u91cf\u66ff\u4ee3\u7ecf\u5178\u72b6\u6001\u8bbf\u95ee\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u603b\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u9650\u65f6\u57dfMDP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u6298\u6263\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Previous efforts navigate this\nchallenge primarily through image-level modeling or annotation-based\noptimization. Despite advancing considerably, this commonplace practice hardly\ntaps valuable dataset-level contextual information or relies on laborious\nannotations. In this paper, we propose RISE, a RetrIeval SElf-augmented\nparadigm that exploits the entire training dataset to generate pseudo-labels\nfor single images, which could be used to train COD models. RISE begins by\nconstructing prototype libraries for environments and camouflaged objects using\ntraining images (without ground truth), followed by K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)\nretrieval to generate pseudo-masks for each image based on these libraries. It\nis important to recognize that using only training images without annotations\nexerts a pronounced challenge in crafting high-quality prototype libraries. In\nthis light, we introduce a Clustering-then-Retrieval (CR) strategy, where\ncoarse masks are first generated through clustering, facilitating subsequent\nhistogram-based image filtering and cross-category retrieval to produce\nhigh-confidence prototypes.

Recently, to enhance representation learning on HTGs, numerous\nattention-based neural networks have been proposed.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel learning paradigm for\nHTGs called Simple and Efficient Heterogeneous Temporal Graph N}eural Network\n(SE-HTGNN).

However, their ability to handle complex, real-world web\ndocuments remains limited, particularly in scenarios where text and images are\ninterleaved, loosely aligned, or embedded in visual form. To address these\nchallenges, we propose Vision-Centric Contrastive Learning (VC2L), a unified\nframework that models text, images, and their combinations using a single\nvision transformer. VC2L operates entirely in pixel space by rendering all\ninputs, whether textual, visual, or combined, as images, thus eliminating the\nneed for OCR, text tokenization, or modality fusion strategy. To capture\ncomplex cross-modal relationships in multimodal web documents, VC2L employs a\nsnippet-level contrastive learning objective that aligns consecutive multimodal\nsegments, leveraging the inherent coherence of documents without requiring\nexplicitly paired image-text data. To assess the effectiveness of this\napproach, we introduce three retrieval benchmarks, AnyCIR, SeqCIR, and CSR,\ndesigned to evaluate cross-modal retrieval, fine-grained sequential\nunderstanding, and generalization to unseen data, respectively. Empirical\nresults show that VC2L achieves competitive or superior performance compared to\nCLIP-style models on both the proposed benchmarks and established datasets such\nas M-BEIR and MTEB. These findings underscore the potential of multimodal web\ndata as a valuable training resource for contrastive learning and illustrate\nthe scalability of a unified, vision-centric approach for multimodal\nrepresentation learning.

Using\nplanar 3D primitives - a well-suited representation for man-made environments -\nwe introduce PLANA3R, a pose-free framework for metric Planar 3D Reconstruction\nfrom unposed two-view images. Our approach employs Vision Transformers to\nextract a set of sparse planar primitives, estimate relative camera poses, and\nsupervise geometry learning via planar splatting, where gradients are\npropagated through high-resolution rendered depth and normal maps of\nprimitives. Unlike prior feedforward methods that require 3D plane annotations\nduring training, PLANA3R learns planar 3D structures without explicit plane\nsupervision, enabling scalable training on large-scale stereo datasets using\nonly depth and normal annotations. We validate PLANA3R on multiple indoor-scene\ndatasets with metric supervision and demonstrate strong generalization to\nout-of-domain indoor environments across diverse tasks under metric evaluation\nprotocols, including 3D surface reconstruction, depth estimation, and relative\npose estimation.

However, the vanilla 3DGS assumes static\nillumination and that observed appearance depends solely on viewing angle,\nwhich causes incompatibility with the photometric variations in colonoscopic\nscenes induced by dynamic light source/camera. This mismatch forces most 3DGS\nmethods to introduce structure-violating vaporous Gaussian blobs between the\ncamera and tissues to compensate for illumination attenuation, ultimately\ndegrading the quality of 3D reconstructions. Previous works only consider the\nillumination attenuation caused by light distance, ignoring the physical\ncharacters of light source and camera. In this paper, we propose ColIAGS, an\nimproved 3DGS framework tailored for colonoscopy. To mimic realistic appearance\nunder varying illumination, we introduce an Improved Appearance Modeling with\ntwo types of illumination attenuation factors, which enables Gaussians to adapt\nto photometric variations while preserving geometry accuracy. To ensure the\ngeometry approximation condition of appearance modeling, we propose an Improved\nGeometry Modeling using high-dimensional view embedding to enhance Gaussian\ngeometry attribute prediction. Furthermore, another cosine embedding input is\nleveraged to generate illumination attenuation solutions in an implicit manner.\nComprehensive experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our\nproposed ColIAGS achieves the dual capabilities of novel view synthesis and\naccurate geometric reconstruction.

Recent data-driven methods based\non deep learning have achieved significant success in the medium range, but\nstruggle at longer subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) horizons due to error\naccumulation in their autoregressive approach. In this work, we propose\nOmniCast, a scalable and skillful probabilistic model that unifies weather\nforecasting across timescales. OmniCast consists of two components: a VAE model\nthat encodes raw weather data into a continuous, lower-dimensional latent\nspace, and a diffusion-based transformer model that generates a sequence of\nfuture latent tokens given the initial conditioning tokens. During training, we\nmask random future tokens and train the transformer to estimate their\ndistribution given conditioning and visible tokens using a per-token diffusion\nhead. During inference, the transformer generates the full sequence of future\ntokens by iteratively unmasking random subsets of tokens. This joint sampling\nacross space and time mitigates compounding errors from autoregressive\napproaches.

Building upon this paradigm, we focus on the integration of\nspectral and spatial cues and introduce a novel \"Rebellious Student\" framework\nfor complementary feature learning. Unlike conventional teacher-student\nparadigms driven by imitation, our method intentionally trains the spatial\nbranch to diverge from the spectral teacher, thereby learning complementary\nspatial patterns that the teacher fails to capture. A two-stage learning\nstrategy is adopted: (1) a spectral enhancement network is first trained via\nreverse distillation to obtain robust background spectral representations; and\n(2) a spatial network -- the rebellious student -- is subsequently optimized\nusing decorrelation losses that enforce feature orthogonality while maintaining\nreconstruction fidelity to avoid irrelevant noise. Once trained, the framework\nenhances both spectral and spatial background features, enabling parameter-free\nand training-free anomaly detection when paired with conventional detectors.\nExtensive experiments on the HAD100 benchmark show substantial improvements\nover several established baselines with minimal computational overhead,\nconfirming the effectiveness and generality of the proposed complementary\nlearning paradigm.

A few recent works (Zhu et al., 2023, Mukherjee et al., 2024,\nThekumparampil et al., 2024) have explored using multiple comparisons and\nranking feedback, but their performance guarantees fail to improve-and can even\ndeteriorate-as the feedback length increases, despite the richer information\navailable. To address this gap, we adopt the Plackett-Luce (PL) model for\nranking feedback over action subsets and propose M-AUPO, an algorithm that\nselects multiple actions by maximizing the average uncertainty within the\noffered subset. We prove that M-AUPO achieves a suboptimality gap of\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{d}{T} \\sqrt{ \\sum_{t=1}^T \\frac{1}{|S_t|}}\n\\right)$, where $T$ is the total number of rounds, $d$ is the feature\ndimension, and $|S_t|$ is the size of the subset at round $t$.

In addition, the CLIP text encoder lacks\nsupport for multilingual inputs. All these limitations significantly restrict\nits applicability across a broader range of tasks. Recent studies have\nattempted to replace the CLIP text encoder with an LLM-based embedder to\nenhance its ability in processing long texts, multilingual understanding, and\nfine-grained semantic comprehension. However, because the representation spaces\nof LLMs and the vision-language space of CLIP are pretrained independently\nwithout alignment priors, direct alignment using contrastive learning can\ndisrupt the intrinsic vision-language alignment in the CLIP image encoder,\nleading to an underutilization of the knowledge acquired during pre-training.\nTo address this challenge, we propose ProCLIP, a curriculum learning-based\nprogressive vision-language alignment framework to effectively align the CLIP\nimage encoder with an LLM-based embedder. Specifically, ProCLIP first distills\nknowledge from CLIP's text encoder into the LLM-based embedder to leverage\nCLIP's rich pretrained knowledge while establishing initial alignment between\nthe LLM embedder and CLIP image encoder. Subsequently, ProCLIP further aligns\nthe CLIP image encoder with the LLM-based embedder through image-text\ncontrastive tuning, employing self-distillation regularization to avoid\noverfitting.

While generally less sample\nefficient, recent breakthroughs demonstrate that modern ZO methods can\neffectively approximate gradients and achieve performance competitive with BP\nin neural network models.

Its core principles of random exploration (probing) and\nfeedback-guided adaptation (reinforcing) parallel key mechanisms of biological\nlearning, offering a mathematically principled perspective on how the brain\nlearns. In this review, we begin by categorizing optimization approaches based\non the order of derivative information they utilize, ranging from first-,\nsecond-, and higher-order gradient-based to ZO methods. We then explore how\nthese methods are adapted to the unique challenges of neural network training\nand the resulting learning dynamics.

This work\ndemonstrates how counterfactual reasoning can be formalized as an optimization\nproblem over predictive functions, offering a rigorous, interpretable, and\ncomputationally efficient approach to personalized inference in complex\nbiomedical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eCOVID-19\u540e\u9057\u75c7\uff08PASC\uff09\u548c\u5fc3\u529b\u8870\u7aed\uff08HF\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u3002", "motivation": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528NICE\u548cMOC\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e72\u9884\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u57282700\u591a\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff08AUROC: 0.88\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u63a8\u65ad\u3002"}}

In this paper, toward identifying guidelines for\nmitigating this phenomenon, we systematically compare the forgetting patterns\nof two widely adopted post-training methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and\nreinforcement learning (RL). Our experiments reveal a consistent trend across\nLM families (Llama, Qwen) and tasks (instruction following, general knowledge,\nand arithmetic reasoning): RL leads to less forgetting than SFT while achieving\ncomparable or higher target task performance. To investigate the cause for this\ndifference, we consider a simplified setting in which the LM is modeled as a\nmixture of two distributions, one corresponding to prior knowledge and the\nother to the target task. We identify that the mode-seeking nature of RL, which\nstems from its use of on-policy data, enables keeping prior knowledge intact\nwhen learning the target task. We then verify this insight by demonstrating\nthat the use on-policy data underlies the robustness of RL to forgetting in\npractical settings, as opposed to other algorithmic choices such as the KL\nregularization or advantage estimation. Lastly, as a practical implication, our\nresults highlight the potential of mitigating forgetting using approximately\non-policy data, which can be substantially more efficient to obtain than fully\non-policy data.", "AI": {"tldr": "RL\u6bd4SFT\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9000\u5316\uff08\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff08SFT\uff09\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RL\uff09\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "RL\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u66f4\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "RL\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u4f7f\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u5185\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}
