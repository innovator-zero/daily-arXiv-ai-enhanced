This data\nstructure contains indispensable spatial and temporal cues that current methods\nfail to fully exploit. Models often compromise by either collapsing spatial\ninformation into vectors or applying spatio-temporal models that are\ncomputationally inefficient and incompatible with non-uniform time steps. We\naddress this challenge with Time-Aware $\\Delta$t-Mamba3D, a novel state-space\narchitecture adapted for longitudinal medical imaging. Our model simultaneously\nencodes irregular inter-visit intervals and rich spatio-temporal context while\nremaining computationally efficient. Its core innovation is a continuous-time\nselective scanning mechanism that explicitly integrates the true time\ndifference between exams into its state transitions.

It is a framework optimized for machine learning\n(ML) computations on Apple silicon devices, facilitating easier research,\nexperimentation, and prototyping.\n  This paper presents a performance evaluation of MLX, focusing on inference\nlatency of transformer models. We compare the performance of different\ntransformer architecture implementations in MLX with their Pytorch\ncounterparts. For this research we create a framework called MLX-transformers\nwhich includes different transformer implementations in MLX and downloads the\nmodel checkpoints in pytorch and converts it to the MLX format. By leveraging\nthe advanced architecture and capabilities of Apple Silicon, MLX-Transformers\nenables seamless execution of transformer models directly sourced from Hugging\nFace, eliminating the need for checkpoint conversion often required when\nporting models between frameworks.\n  Our study benchmarks different transformer models on two Apple Silicon\nmacbook devices against an NVIDIA CUDA GPU. Specifically, we compare the\ninference latency performance of models with the same parameter sizes and\ncheckpoints. We evaluate the performance of BERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa\nmodels, with the intention of extending future work to include models of\ndifferent modalities, thus providing a more comprehensive assessment of MLX's\ncapabilities.

Yet, applying RL in\noff-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for\ntraining--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy\ndeclines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse.\nThrough theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i)\nan imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the\npolicy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions;\nand (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping\nmechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing\nupdates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of\nexploration.

Although obtaining tight bounds remains challenging, such\nmeasures are often assumed to reproduce qualitative generalization trends. In\nthis position paper, we argue that many post-mortem generalization measures --\nthose computed on trained networks -- are \\textbf{fragile}: small training\nmodifications that barely affect the underlying DNN can substantially change a\nmeasure's value, trend, or scaling behavior. For example, minor hyperparameter\nchanges, such as learning rate adjustments or switching between SGD variants\ncan reverse the slope of a learning curve in widely used generalization\nmeasures like the path norm. We also identify subtler forms of fragility. For\ninstance, the PAC-Bayes origin measure is regarded as one of the most reliable,\nand is indeed less sensitive to hyperparameter tweaks than many other measures.\nHowever, it completely fails to capture differences in data complexity across\nlearning curves. This data fragility contrasts with the function-based\nmarginal-likelihood PAC-Bayes bound, which does capture differences in\ndata-complexity, including scaling behavior, in learning curves, but which is\nnot a post-mortem measure.

In contrast, the latter directly fine-tunes a carefully chosen\nsubset of the original model parameters, allowing for more precise and\neffective adaptation, but at the cost of significantly increased memory\nconsumption.

To mitigate this phenomenon, existing solutions either introduce\nadditional data for further training or incorporate external or internal\ninformation during inference. However, these approaches inevitably introduce\nextra computational costs. In this paper, we observe that hallucinations in\nMLLMs are strongly associated with insufficient attention allocated to visual\ntokens. In particular, the presence of redundant visual tokens disperses the\nmodel's attention, preventing it from focusing on the most informative ones. As\na result, critical visual cues are often under-attended, which in turn\nexacerbates the occurrence of hallucinations. Building on this observation, we\npropose \\textbf{PruneHal}, a training-free, simple yet effective method that\nleverages adaptive KV cache pruning to enhance the model's focus on critical\nvisual information, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To the best of our\nknowledge, we are the first to apply token pruning for hallucination mitigation\nin MLLMs. Notably, our method don't require additional training and incurs\nnearly no extra inference cost. Moreover, PruneHal is model-agnostic and can be\nseamlessly integrated with different decoding strategies, including those\nspecifically designed for hallucination mitigation.

Through controlled post-training\nexperiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks with Llama3.1-8B, Mistral-7B,\nand Gemma3-4B, we find that (i) no curriculum strategy dominates universally -\nthe relative effectiveness of forward versus reverse CL depends jointly on\nmodel capability and task complexity; (ii) even within a single metric, samples\nat different difficulty levels produce distinct gains depending on task\ndemands; and (iii) task-aligned curricula focus on shaping the model's final\nrepresentations and generalization, whereas inner-state curricula modulate\ninternal states such as confidence and uncertainty.

However, it remains limited by\nits reliance on high-quality, task-specific data, restricting adaptability to\nthe diverse range of real-world object configurations and scenarios. In\ncontrast, non-expert data -- such as play data, suboptimal demonstrations,\npartial task completions, or rollouts from suboptimal policies -- can offer\nbroader coverage and lower collection costs. However, conventional imitation\nlearning approaches fail to utilize this data effectively. To address these\nchallenges, we posit that with right design decisions, offline reinforcement\nlearning can be used as a tool to harness non-expert data to enhance the\nperformance of imitation learning policies.

Our approach shows that broadening\nthe support of the policy distribution can allow imitation algorithms augmented\nby offline RL to solve tasks robustly, showing considerably enhanced recovery\nand generalization behavior.

Traditional Granger causality tests\nbased on linear models often fail to detect even mild non-linear causal\nrelationships.

Second, leveraging this structure, we propose a modified NGVI\nalgorithm incorporating non-Euclidean projections and prove its global\nnon-asymptotic convergence to a stationary point. Finally, under additional\nstructural assumptions about the likelihood, we uncover hidden convexity\nproperties of the variational loss and establish fast global convergence of\nNGVI to a global optimum.

However, the\nobjective of predicting future pixels is often at odds with the actual planning\nobjective; strong pixel reconstruction does not always correlate with good\nplanning decisions. This paper posits that instead of reconstructing future\nframes as pixels, world models only need to predict task-relevant semantic\ninformation about the future. For such prediction the paper poses world\nmodeling as a visual question answering problem about semantic information in\nfuture frames. This perspective allows world modeling to be approached with the\nsame tools underlying vision language models. Thus vision language models can\nbe trained as \"semantic\" world models through a supervised finetuning process\non image-action-text data, enabling planning for decision-making while\ninheriting many of the generalization and robustness properties from the\npretrained vision-language models. The paper demonstrates how such a semantic\nworld model can be used for policy improvement on open-ended robotics tasks,\nleading to significant generalization improvements over typical paradigms of\nreconstruction-based action-conditional world modeling.

In this\nwork, we aim to protect the IP of NeRFs by injecting adversarial perturbations\nthat disrupt their unauthorized applications. However, perturbing the 3D\ngeometry of NeRFs can easily deform the underlying scene structure and thus\nsubstantially degrade the rendering quality, which has led existing attempts to\navoid geometric perturbations or restrict them to explicit spaces like meshes.\nTo overcome this limitation, we introduce a learnable sensitivity to quantify\nthe spatially varying impact of geometric perturbations on rendering quality.\nBuilding upon this, we propose AegisRF, a novel framework that consists of a\nPerturbation Field, which injects adversarial perturbations into the\npre-rendering outputs (color and volume density) of NeRF models to fool an\nunauthorized downstream target model, and a Sensitivity Field, which learns the\nsensitivity to adaptively constrain geometric perturbations, preserving\nrendering quality while disrupting unauthorized use.

They also serve as the\nfoundation for the recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Yet most\nevaluations of VLMs focus on single-view settings, leaving their ability to\nintegrate multi-view information underexplored. At the same time, multi-camera\nsetups are increasingly standard in robotic platforms, as they provide\ncomplementary perspectives to mitigate occlusion and depth ambiguity. Whether\nVLMs can effectively leverage such multi-view inputs for robotic reasoning\ntherefore remains an open question. To bridge this gap, we introduce\nMV-RoboBench, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the multi-view\nspatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs in robotic manipulation. MV-RoboBench\nconsists of 1.7k manually curated QA items across eight subtasks, divided into\ntwo primary categories: spatial understanding and robotic execution. We\nevaluate a diverse set of existing VLMs, including both open-source and\nclosed-source models, along with enhanced versions incorporating CoT-inspired\ntechniques. The results show that state-of-the-art models remain far below\nhuman performance, underscoring the substantial challenges VLMs face in\nmulti-view robotic perception. Additionally, our analysis uncovers two key\nfindings: (i) spatial intelligence and robotic task execution are positively\ncorrelated in multi-view robotic scenarios; and (ii) strong performance on\nexisting general-purpose single-view spatial understanding benchmarks does not\nreliably translate to success in the robotic spatial tasks assessed by our\nbenchmark.

To make this approach\npossible, it is necessary to accurately collect the positions of workers in a\nwarehouse and reflect them in a virtual space. However, a single camera has\nlimitations in its field of view, therefore sensing with multiple cameras is\nnecessary. In this study, we explored a method to track workers using 19\nwide-angle cameras installed on the ceiling, looking down at the floor of the\nlogistics warehouse. To understand the relationship between the camera\ncoordinates and the actual positions in the warehouse, we performed alignment\nbased on the floor surface. However, due to the characteristics of wide-angle\ncameras, significant distortion occurs at the edges of the image, particularly\nin the vertical direction. To address this, the detected worker positions from\neach camera were aligned based on foot positions, reducing the effects of image\ndistortion, and enabling accurate position alignment across cameras.

In this paper, we introduce PICK, a\nmulti-step framework designed for Psychoanalytical Image Comprehension through\nhierarchical analysis and Knowledge injection with MLLMs, specifically focusing\non the House-Tree-Person (HTP) Test, a widely used psychological assessment in\nclinical practice. First, we decompose drawings containing multiple instances\ninto semantically meaningful sub-drawings, constructing a hierarchical\nrepresentation that captures spatial structure and content across three levels:\nsingle-object level, multi-object level, and whole level. Next, we analyze\nthese sub-drawings at each level with a targeted focus, extracting\npsychological or emotional insights from their visual cues. We also introduce\nan HTP knowledge base and design a feature extraction module, trained with\nreinforcement learning, to generate a psychological profile for single-object\nlevel analysis. This profile captures both holistic stylistic features and\ndynamic object-specific features (such as those of the house, tree, or person),\ncorrelating them with psychological states. Finally, we integrate these\nmulti-faceted information to produce a well-informed assessment that aligns\nwith expert-level reasoning.

This difficulty stems from two primary factors. First, real-world\nconditions, such as the high yield-rate requirements in the IC industry, result\nin data distributions that are far more skewed than those found in general\npublic imbalanced datasets. Consequently, classifiers designed for open\nimbalanced datasets often fail to perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\nSecond, real-world samples exhibit a mix of class-specific attributes and\nclass-agnostic, domain-related features. This complexity adds significant\ndifficulty to the classification process, particularly for highly imbalanced\ndatasets. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the IC-Defect-14\ndataset, a large, highly imbalanced IC defect image dataset sourced from AOI\nsystems deployed in real-world IC production lines. This dataset is\ncharacterized by its unique \"intra-class clusters\" property, which presents two\nmajor challenges: large intra-class diversity and high inter-class similarity.\nThese characteristics, rarely found simultaneously in existing public datasets,\nsignificantly degrade the performance of current state-of-the-art classifiers\nfor highly imbalanced data.

Extensive experiments\nacross vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently\nimproves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training\ndata, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.\nOur findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently\ntransferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer\nexpertise for building a stronger SSM community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCAB\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6865\u5c06Transformer\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08SSMs\uff09\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0eTransformer\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "CAB\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6865\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5c42\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8f93\u51fa\u7ea7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAB\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u9886\u57df\u5747\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SSM\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e5\u8bc6\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5faa\u73af\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5feb\u901f\u5229\u7528Transformer\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684SSM\u793e\u533a\u3002"}}

However, VLMs still exhibit several limitations in\nvisual reasoning, such as difficulties in identifying relations (e.g., spatial,\ntemporal, and among objects), understanding temporal sequences (e.g., frames),\nand counting objects. In this work, we go beyond score-level benchmark\nevaluations of VLMs by investigating the underlying causes of their failures\nand proposing a targeted approach to improve their reasoning capabilities. We\nstudy the reasoning skills of seven state-of-the-art VLMs in the counting task\nunder controlled experimental conditions. Our experiments show that VLMs are\nhighly sensitive to the number and type of objects, their spatial arrangement,\nand the co-occurrence of distractors.

To\ntackle this tension, we claim that geometric information must be learned\nexplicitly, and the resulting features should be leveraged to guide the\nelevating of semantic quality in novel views. In this paper, we introduce\n\\textbf{Visual Gaussian Driving (VGD)}, a novel feed-forward end-to-end\nlearning framework designed to address this challenge. To achieve generalizable\ngeometric estimation, we design a lightweight variant of the VGGT architecture\nto efficiently distill its geometric priors from the pre-trained VGGT to the\ngeometry branch.

Earth Observation (EO) represents a\nquintessential domain for multi-modal data analysis, wherein diverse remote\nsensors collect data to sense our planet. This unprecedented volume of data\nintroduces novel challenges. Specifically, the access to the same sensor\nmodalities at both training and inference stages becomes increasingly complex\nbased on real-world constraints affecting remote sensing platforms. In this\ncontext, multi-modal co-learning presents a promising strategy to leverage the\nvast amount of sensor-derived data available at the training stage to improve\nsingle-modality models for inference-time deployment. Most current research\nefforts focus on designing customized solutions for either particular\ndownstream tasks or specific modalities available at the inference stage. To\naddress this, we propose a novel multi-modal co-learning framework capable of\ngeneralizing across various tasks without targeting a specific modality for\ninference. Our approach combines contrastive and modality discriminative\nlearning together to guide single-modality models to structure the internal\nmodel manifold into modality-shared and modality-specific information. We\nevaluate our framework on four EO benchmarks spanning classification and\nregression tasks across different sensor modalities, where only one of the\nmodalities available during training is accessible at inference time. Our\nresults demonstrate consistent predictive improvements over state-of-the-art\napproaches from the recent machine learning and computer vision literature, as\nwell as EO-specific methods.

When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one\noften assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but\nperhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.\nThe task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this\n`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on\nwhat `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely\nsome discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently\nmonotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a\ncarefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of\nmonotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time\nand the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate\nfeatures which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed\nsystem is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two\nreal-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to\ncombine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high\nmonotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health\nmonitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute\nSpearman's $\\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with\nan absolute Spearman's $\\rho$ of $0.95$.

However, existing CLIP-style graph-text aligners face two\nkey limitations: they assume strict one-to-one correspondences between nodes\nand texts, overlooking the inherent many-to-many relations in real-world\ngraphs; and they rely on static alignment objectives that cannot adapt to\nvarying data quality, making them brittle under noisy supervision. Together,\nthese limitations expose a core dilemma: embracing expressive many-to-many\nalignment amplifies noise, while reverting to strict one-to-one strategies\nsacrifices semantic diversity and fails to handle inherently mismatched pairs.\nTo address these challenges, we propose ADAligner, a dynamic, quality-aware\ngraph-text alignment framework that dynamically adjusts between expressive\nmany-to-many and conservative one-to-one objectives according to supervision\nquality.

Since SVD operates exclusively on linear modules, and these modules\nin LLMs are separated by nonlinear components, SVD can only be applied\nindependently to each linear module. Under a global compression ratio\nconstraint, determining the appropriate rank for different linear modules\nbecomes a critical problem. Existing approaches, such as heuristic algorithms\nand mask-based training, have made progress in addressing this challenge.\nHowever, these methods still suffer from several limitations: heuristic\nalgorithms explore the solution space within restricted regions, while\nmask-based training struggles to efficiently capture the relationship between\nsingular value spectra and trainable parameters.

During edge inference, memory usage and latency are the primary\nbottlenecks. Although weight quantization can effectively reduce memory\nconsumption, existing hardware-friendly approaches often rely on uniform\nquantization, which poorly fits weight distributions and incurs high\ndequantization overhead at low bit widths. To address these limitations, we\npropose ELUTQ, an efficient quantization framework introducing a novel\nquantization format, Hierarchical Linear Quantization (HLQ). HLQ better\ncaptures the statistical characteristics of weights without increasing the\ncomputational cost of Bit-serial LUT-based GEMM operations, thereby eliminating\ndequantization overhead. It is orthogonal to existing quantization algorithms\nand can be seamlessly integrated into various quantization pipelines. For\nefficient on-device deployment, ELUTQ provides optimized CPU kernels for\nend-to-end inference.

However, existing methods\noften face two major challenges: the highly non-uniform distribution of\nactivations and the static, mismatched codebooks used in weight quantization.\nTo address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Distribution-aware\nQuantization (ADQ), a mixed-precision quantization framework that employs a\ndifferentiated strategy. The core of ADQ is a novel adaptive weight\nquantization scheme comprising three key innovations: (1) a quantile-based\ninitialization method that constructs a codebook closely aligned with the\ninitial weight distribution; (2) an online codebook adaptation mechanism based\non Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to dynamically track distributional shifts;\nand (3) a sensitivity-informed strategy for mixed-precision allocation.

Traditional solutions adopt a two-stage pipeline: machine learning\n(ML) for predicting individual treatment effects to marketing actions, followed\nby operations research (OR) optimization for decision-making. This paradigm\npresents two fundamental technical challenges. First, the prediction-decision\nmisalignment: Conventional ML methods focus solely on prediction accuracy\nwithout considering downstream optimization objectives, leading to improved\npredictive metrics that fail to translate to better decisions. Second, the\nbias-variance dilemma: Observational data suffers from multiple biases (e.g.,\nselection bias, position bias), while experimental data (e.g., randomized\ncontrolled trials), though unbiased, is typically scarce and costly --\nresulting in high-variance estimates. We propose Bi-level Decision-Focused\nCausal Learning (Bi-DFCL) that systematically addresses these challenges.\nFirst, we develop an unbiased estimator of OR decision quality using\nexperimental data, which guides ML model training through surrogate loss\nfunctions that bridge discrete optimization gradients. Second, we establish a\nbi-level optimization framework that jointly leverages observational and\nexperimental data, solved via implicit differentiation.

Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building\nevacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation\nsimulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse\nfunctional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was\nestablished. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed\nphysical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a\ndiffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns\nfrom simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using\nConditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%\nimprovement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,\nthereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate\nthat the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design\niteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also\noffers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in\nintelligent building design.

By enabling feature-level cross-step reuse and\ninter-layer scheduling, it reduces computation without modifying model\nparameters. This paper systematically reviews the theoretical foundations and\nevolution of Diffusion Caching and proposes a unified framework for its\nclassification and analysis.\n  Through comparative analysis of representative methods, we show that\nDiffusion Caching evolves from \\textit{static reuse} to \\textit{dynamic\nprediction}. This trend enhances caching flexibility across diverse tasks and\nenables integration with other acceleration techniques such as sampling\noptimization and model distillation, paving the way for a unified, efficient\ninference framework for future multimodal and interactive applications. We\nargue that this paradigm will become a key enabler of real-time and efficient\ngenerative AI, injecting new vitality into both theory and practice of\n\\textit{Efficient Generative Intelligence}.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion Caching\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u8fed\u4ee3\u548c\u590d\u6742\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDiffusion Caching\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7ea7\u8de8\u6b65\u91cd\u7528\u548c\u5c42\u95f4\u8c03\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "Diffusion Caching\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u91cd\u7528\u5230\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5e76\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u52a0\u901f\u6280\u672f\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "Diffusion Caching\u5c06\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210AI\u7684\u5173\u952e\u63a8\u52a8\u529b\u3002"}}

In response to this growing\ntension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel\nlightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively\nsmall-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.\nConcretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral\ndecomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of\npre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but\nalso the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in\ncurrent methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns\nheterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and\nadaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for\nparameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.\nEquipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data\nscale and model size, while achieving strong generalization.

Can Alice prove that Bob is using\nher model, either by querying Bob's derivative model (query setting) or from\nthe text alone (observational setting)? We formulate this question as an\nindependence testing problem--in which the null hypothesis is that Bob's model\nor text is independent of Alice's randomized training run--and investigate it\nthrough the lens of palimpsestic memorization in language models: models are\nmore likely to memorize data seen later in training, so we can test whether Bob\nis using Alice's model using test statistics that capture correlation between\nBob's model or text and the ordering of training examples in Alice's training\nrun. If Alice has randomly shuffled her training data, then any significant\ncorrelation amounts to exactly quantifiable statistical evidence against the\nnull hypothesis, regardless of the composition of Alice's training data. In the\nquery setting, we directly estimate (via prompting) the likelihood Bob's model\ngives to Alice's training examples and order; we correlate the likelihoods of\nover 40 fine-tunes of various Pythia and OLMo base models ranging from 1B to\n12B parameters with the base model's training data order, achieving a p-value\non the order of at most 1e-8 in all but six cases. In the observational\nsetting, we try two approaches based on estimating 1) the likelihood of Bob's\ntext overlapping with spans of Alice's training examples and 2) the likelihood\nof Bob's text with respect to different versions of Alice's model we obtain by\nrepeating the last phase (e.g., 1%) of her training run on reshuffled data.

This paper examines the\ntechnical and fiscal feasibility of sovereign-scale language model training in\nBrazil and Mexico under conditions of constrained hardware access, energy\navailability, and fiscal ceilings. Using a dual-axis design that varies\naccelerator generation (NVIDIA H100 vs. A100) and training duration (90 vs. 150\ndays), we estimate compute demand, energy consumption, capital expenditures,\nand regulatory compatibility for the training of a 10-trillion-token model.

H100-based scenarios achieve training feasibility at a\ntotal cost of 8-14 million USD, while A100 deployments require 19-32 million\nUSD due to higher energy and hardware demand.
