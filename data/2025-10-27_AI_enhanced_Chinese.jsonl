Despite extensive recent advances in\nidentifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between\ntheory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap\nby bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically,\nthis paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of\nposition and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose\nEstimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES\nembodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative\nfactors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic\nlatent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background,\nand camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the\ncontrollable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated\n(intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that\nvariables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In\nrobotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various\njoints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in\nsemi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully\ndisentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the\nground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional\nchanges, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison\nwith a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This\npaper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical\ntestbed for CRL.", "AI": {"tldr": "ROPES\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u63a7\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u534a\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CRL\uff09\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fd9\u4e00\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u6765\u7f29\u5c0f\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "ROPES\u6846\u67b6\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u9884\u6027CRL\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u64cd\u7eb5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5173\u8282\u5e76\u8bb0\u5f55\u56fe\u50cf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u534a\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cROPES\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u662fCRL\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0cROPES\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u65e0\u76d1\u7763CRL\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

These adapters are typically trained to\ncapture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using\nsingle-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image\ninevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle\nthe target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and\nlighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs\nthe model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we\nuncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to\neliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training,\nconfounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or\nLoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them.

Conventional approaches often force weak\nmodalities to align with dominant ones in \"Learning to be (the same)\" (Positive\nLearning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak\nmodalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm:\n\"Learning Not to be\" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities'\ntarget-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak\nmodality to suppress non-target classes.

Current approaches rely on fine-tuning\nprotein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with\ncross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and\nlimited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first\napplication of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property\nprediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens\nto directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon\ntransformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation\nto new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning\ndataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical\nlimitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown\ntokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse\nprotein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and\nsolubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning.\nIn cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better\naccuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better\naccuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains\nconsistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it\nparticularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein\ndesign where experimental data is limited.

This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic\nhuman activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach\ncan generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language\ndescriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion.\nWe process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training\ndataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide\nrange of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment\nvariations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data.\nWe design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on\nthis dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely\nunseen real-world observations.

However, these methods still have notable shortcomings in actual\nUAV systems: low-light enhancement often introduces visual artifacts, domain\nadaptation methods are computationally expensive and existing lightweight\ndesigns struggle to fully leverage dynamic object information. Based on an\nin-depth analysis of these key issues, we propose MATrack-a multiscale adaptive\nsystem designed specifically for nighttime UAV tracking.

However, existing methods typically rely on a\nsingle textual space to align with visual semantics across diverse objects and\ndomains. The indiscriminate alignment hinders the model from accurately\ncapturing varied anomaly semantics. We propose TokenCLIP, a token-wise\nadaptation framework that enables dynamic alignment between visual and\nlearnable textual spaces for fine-grained anomaly learning. Rather than mapping\nall visual tokens to a single, token-agnostic textual space, TokenCLIP aligns\neach token with a customized textual subspace that represents its visual\ncharacteristics. Explicitly assigning a unique learnable textual space to each\ntoken is computationally intractable and prone to insufficient optimization. We\ninstead expand the token-agnostic textual space into a set of orthogonal\nsubspaces, and then dynamically assign each token to a subspace combination\nguided by semantic affinity, which jointly supports customized and efficient\ntoken-wise adaptation. To this end, we formulate dynamic alignment as an\noptimal transport problem, where all visual tokens in an image are transported\nto textual subspaces based on semantic similarity. The transport constraints of\nOT ensure sufficient optimization across subspaces and encourage them to focus\non different semantics. Solving the problem yields a transport plan that\nadaptively assigns each token to semantically relevant subspaces. A top-k\nmasking is then applied to sparsify the plan and specialize subspaces for\ndistinct visual regions.

Beyond its memory\nefficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning\n(CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency\ntrilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO\noptimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce\nforgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to\nits imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends\nto be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge,\nparticularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this\ntrade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to\nvarious existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances\nstability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with\nlearnable classifiers.

Our primary motivation for TSSR is to achieve highly\naccurate token prediction while enabling parallel generation, a significant\nadvantage over sequential autoregressive methods. By allowing TSSR to \"see\" all\nmesh tokens concurrently, we unlock a new level of efficiency and control. We\nleverage this parallel generation capability through three key innovations: 1)\nDecoupled Training and Hybrid Inference, which distinctly separates the\nDDM-based generation into a topology sculpting stage and a subsequent shape\nrefinement stage. This strategic decoupling enables TSSR to effectively capture\nboth intricate local topology and overarching global shape. 2) An Improved\nHourglass Architecture, featuring bidirectional attention enriched by\nface-vertex-sequence level Rotational Positional Embeddings (RoPE), thereby\ncapturing richer contextual information across the mesh structure. 3) A novel\nConnection Loss, which acts as a topological constraint to further enhance the\nrealism and fidelity of the generated meshes.

A-GPS learns a\ngenerative model of the Pareto set that supports a-posteriori conditioning on\nuser preferences. The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to\npredict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward\nhigh-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this\nnon-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume\nimprovement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces\npreference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in\nobjective space.

To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a\nsparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden\nactivations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept\nrepresented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting\nthese representations with a unified concept set. To establish the\nneuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations\nto exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training.\nFirst, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we\nperform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second,\nwe construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific\ndecoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar\nrepresentations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA)\ndemonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the\nvision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and\nlanguage representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with\nconcepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning\nvision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to\nperformance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image\nclassification and hallucination elimination.

However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios,\nlimited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine\ntextures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint\nend-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a\ntarget quality level derived from the available bandwidth.

It has the following features: 1) Practical retrieval paradigm: MUVR\nsupports video-centric multi-modal queries, expressing fine-grained retrieval\nneeds through long text descriptions, video tag prompts, and mask prompts. It\nadopts a one-to-many retrieval paradigm and focuses on untrimmed videos,\ntailored for long-video platform applications. 2) Multi-level visual\ncorrespondence: To cover common video categories (e.g., news, travel, dance)\nand precisely define retrieval matching criteria, we construct multi-level\nvisual correspondence based on core video content (e.g., news events, travel\nlocations, dance moves) which users are interested in and want to retrieve. It\ncovers six levels: copy, event, scene, instance, action, and others. 3)\nComprehensive evaluation criteria: We develop 3 versions of MUVR (i.e., Base,\nFilter, QA). MUVR-Base/Filter evaluates retrieval models, while MUVR-QA\nassesses MLLMs in a question-answering format. We also propose a Reranking\nScore to evaluate the reranking ability of MLLMs. MUVR consists of 53K\nuntrimmed videos from the video platform Bilibili, with 1,050 multi-modal\nqueries and 84K matches. Extensive evaluations of 3 state-of-the-art video\nretrieval models, 6 image-based VLMs, and 10 MLLMs are conducted. MUVR reveals\nthe limitations of retrieval methods in processing untrimmed videos and\nmulti-modal queries, as well as MLLMs in multi-video understanding and\nreranking.

Recently, offline VAD has garnered substantial research\nattention, which has been invigorated by the progress in large language models\n(LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), offering the potential for a more\nnuanced understanding of anomalies. However, online VAD has seldom received\nattention due to real-time constraints and computational intensity. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel Memory-based online scoring queue scheme for\nTraining-free VAD (MoniTor), to address the inherent complexities in online\nVAD. Specifically, MoniTor applies a streaming input to VLMs, leveraging the\ncapabilities of pre-trained large-scale models. To capture temporal\ndependencies more effectively, we incorporate a novel prediction mechanism\ninspired by Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. This ensures the model can\neffectively model past states and leverage previous predictions to identify\nanomalous behaviors. Thereby, it better understands the current frame.\nMoreover, we design a scoring queue and an anomaly prior to dynamically store\nrecent scores and cover all anomalies in the monitoring scenario, providing\nguidance for LLMs to distinguish between normal and abnormal behaviors over\ntime. We evaluate MoniTor on two large datasets (i.e., UCF-Crime and\nXD-Violence) containing various surveillance and real-world scenarios.

Each pattern exhibits consistent activation behavior across images\nsharing specific radiological features, enabling transparent attribution where\npredictions decompose into 20-50 interpretable patterns with verifiable\nactivation galleries. CXR-LanIC achieves competitive diagnostic accuracy on\nfive key findings while providing the foundation for natural language\nexplanations through planned large multimodal model annotation. Our key\ninnovation lies in extracting interpretable features from a classifier trained\non specific diagnostic objectives rather than general-purpose embeddings,\nensuring discovered patterns are directly relevant to clinical decision-making,\ndemonstrating that medical AI systems can be both accurate and interpretable,\nsupporting safer clinical deployment through transparent, clinically grounded\nexplanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "CXR-LanIC\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5f0f\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u9700\u8981\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u6765\u4fe1\u4efb\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u201c\u9ed1\u76d2\u201d\u7279\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528BiomedCLIP\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u89e3\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u53d1\u73b0\u7ea65000\u4e2a\u5355\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "CXR-LanIC\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u8bca\u65ad\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "CXR-LanIC\u8bc1\u660e\u533b\u5b66AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e2\u51c6\u786e\u53c8\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u900f\u660e\u3001\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss,\nand develop an efficient online algorithm.

Therefore, it may seem natural to\nhypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed\nefficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we\nchallenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of\ngenerating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple\ncontexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both\npositive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard\ncomplexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in\nstark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating\nexplanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input\nspace; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the\ntypes of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only\nemerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity\ndistinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus\nclassification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural\nnetworks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to\nexplain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain\nexplanation methods and input domains.

Existing convergence theories for adaptive\noptimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware\nquantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains\neffective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the\nconvergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under\nfloating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g.,\nmoment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth\nnon-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions,\nexplicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components\naffect convergence.

To address this, we propose a compositional bias,\na modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our\nkey insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the\ndata distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has\none nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can\nco-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific\nrules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever\nfactor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary\nobjectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic\nimage, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et\nal.

Under this general framework, simply adjusting\nthe mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even\nboth, without modifying the objectives or architectures.

Recent\nyears have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to\nsolving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter\ndependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this\npaper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid\nphysics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM\nreplaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine\nnetwork.

Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA,\nrouting them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional\noptimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm,\nrequiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to\nevolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone\nrouting that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single\nneural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared\nstructural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a\nmodern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter\nmechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without\nretraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and\nparameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while\nconsistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\\% and traditional\noptimization approaches by 24--82\\% in terms of solution quality (total\ncollected information value).

However, fully realizing the\npotential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including\ncoordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles,\nmodeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling\nreal-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid\nvariables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical\nSAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices\n(UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD\ncost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by\njointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning,\ncomputing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an\nNP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep\ndeterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game\n(MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to\noptimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the\npartially observable SAGIN-MEC system.

However,\nthese methods require large quantities of solution pairs\\u2014the solution\nfunctions and right-hand sides (RHS) of the equations. These pairs are\ntypically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of\ntime steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating\nheavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we\npropose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in\nSolution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer\ntime steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large\ntime steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset\ngeneration and preserves the approximate precision required for model training.\nSpecifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable\nsolver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps\nwith training datasets by downsampling.

Our main contribution is\nthe characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which\nprovides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM\nand DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional\nedge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity\ncoefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity\ncaptured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity\npatterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge\ndensities.
