### [1] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FUGU任务套件用于诊断VLMs在数据可视化理解中的错误来源，发现错误主要源于视觉-语言模块的信息传递问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLMs在数据可视化理解任务中表现不佳，但错误原因不明，需系统分析。

Method: 开发FUGU任务套件，使用激活修补和线性探针分析信息流，测试三种VLMs。

Result: 模型在单个数据点任务中表现改善，但在统计关系任务中表现下降，微调效果有限。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs架构存在限制，需改进视觉-语言模块的信息传递机制。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [2] [Agro-Consensus: Semantic Self-Consistency in Vision-Language Models for Crop Disease Management in Developing Countries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21757)
*Mihir Gupta,Pratik Desai,Ross Greer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种成本效益高的自一致性框架，通过语义聚类和人工确认提升农业图像描述的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决发展中国家农业病害管理中专家资源不足、网络不稳定及AI系统部署成本高的问题。

Method: 使用轻量级预训练嵌入模型进行语义聚类，结合余弦相似度共识机制和人工确认选择最佳描述。

Result: 在PlantVillage数据集上，单聚类共识方法准确率达83.1%，多聚类时提升至94.0%。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了农业图像描述的准确性，适用于资源受限环境。

Abstract: Agricultural disease management in developing countries such as India, Kenya,
and Nigeria faces significant challenges due to limited access to expert plant
pathologists, unreliable internet connectivity, and cost constraints that
hinder the deployment of large-scale AI systems. This work introduces a
cost-effective self-consistency framework to improve vision-language model
(VLM) reliability for agricultural image captioning. The proposed method
employs semantic clustering, using a lightweight (80MB) pre-trained embedding
model to group multiple candidate responses. It then selects the most coherent
caption -- containing a diagnosis, symptoms, analysis, treatment, and
prevention recommendations -- through a cosine similarity-based consensus. A
practical human-in-the-loop (HITL) component is incorporated, wherein user
confirmation of the crop type filters erroneous generations, ensuring
higher-quality input for the consensus mechanism. Applied to the publicly
available PlantVillage dataset using a fine-tuned 3B-parameter PaliGemma model,
our framework demonstrates improvements over standard decoding methods.
Evaluated on 800 crop disease images with up to 21 generations per image, our
single-cluster consensus method achieves a peak accuracy of 83.1% with 10
candidate generations, compared to the 77.5% baseline accuracy of greedy
decoding. The framework's effectiveness is further demonstrated when
considering multiple clusters; accuracy rises to 94.0% when a correct response
is found within any of the top four candidate clusters, outperforming the 88.5%
achieved by a top-4 selection from the baseline.

### [3] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了两种ControlNet模型，用于增强文本到图像生成的空间和几何控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型在生成高保真图像时，对输出空间和几何结构的控制有限。

Method: 引入两种ControlNet：(1) 比例ControlNet，使用边界框控制对象位置和比例；(2) 透视ControlNet，使用消失线控制场景3D几何。

Result: 实验表明两种模块能有效控制，但在复杂约束下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 两种模型已发布在HuggingFace上，为艺术创作提供了更灵活的控制工具。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [4] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一种新框架，通过合成数据学习3D人-物交互（HOI）的全面功能（接触、方向和空间占用），无需人工标注。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注数据集且仅关注接触分析，忽略了方向和空间占用等重要方面。

Method: 使用3D生成模型生成的合成数据，通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习密集3D流表示。

Result: H2OFlow在真实物体上表现优异，超越依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: H2OFlow为3D HOI功能理解提供了一种高效且全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [6] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一个用于面部图像生成的模型，旨在解决现有文本到图像模型在局部语义指令下的面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在面部图像生成中存在面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题，Face-MakeUpV2旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 构建了大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M，采用预训练文本到图像模型作为主干，并引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道，同时设计了语义对齐和感知损失优化目标。

Result: 实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和物理一致性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2在可靠和可控的面部编辑中具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [7] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究紧凑二进制人脸模板的纵向稳定性，量化年龄漂移（以每十年比特数为单位），发现短编码在固定决策阈值下更稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索人脸识别系统中二进制模板随年龄变化的稳定性，为实际部署提供理论支持。

Method: 使用PCA-ITQ压缩现代人脸CNN的浮点嵌入为64位和128位编码，通过线性模型分析年龄差距与汉明距离的关系。

Result: 64位和128位模板的年龄漂移中位数分别为1.357和2.571比特/十年，短编码更稳定。

Conclusion: 短编码在年龄稳定性上表现更好，建议通过定期重新注册和针对性奇偶校验缓解漂移问题。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

### [8] [Bridging Accuracy and Interpretability: Deep Learning with XAI for Breast Cancer Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21780)
*Bishal Chhetri,B. V. Rathish Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可解释的深度学习框架，用于早期乳腺癌检测，性能优异且提供解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习模型在临床应用中因黑盒特性难以被信任的问题，同时提升分类性能。

Method: 使用ReLU激活、Adam优化器和二元交叉熵损失的深度神经网络，结合SHAP和LIME解释技术。

Result: 模型准确率0.992，召回率0.977，F1分数0.988，显著优于其他算法。

Conclusion: 该框架在性能和可解释性上均表现优异，有助于临床决策，其中细胞核凹点特征最具影响力。

Abstract: In this study, we present an interpretable deep learning framework for the
early detection of breast cancer using quantitative features extracted from
digitized fine needle aspirate (FNA) images of breast masses. Our deep neural
network, using ReLU activations, the Adam optimizer, and a binary cross-entropy
loss, delivers state-of-the-art classification performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.992, precision of 1.000, recall of 0.977, and an F1 score of
0.988. These results substantially exceed the benchmarks reported in the
literature. We evaluated the model under identical protocols against a suite of
well-established algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, stochastic gradient descent, K-nearest neighbors, and XGBoost) and
found the deep model consistently superior on the same metrics. Recognizing
that high predictive accuracy alone is insufficient for clinical adoption due
to the black-box nature of deep learning models, we incorporated model-agnostic
Explainable AI techniques such as SHAP and LIME to produce feature-level
attributions and human-readable visualizations. These explanations quantify the
contribution of each feature to individual predictions, support error analysis,
and increase clinician trust, thus bridging the gap between performance and
interpretability for real-world clinical use. The concave points feature of the
cell nuclei is found to be the most influential feature positively impacting
the classification task. This insight can be very helpful in improving the
diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by highlighting the key
characteristics of breast tumor.

### [9] [EdgeSync: Accelerating Edge-Model Updates for Data Drift through Adaptive Continuous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21781)
*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync是一种高效的边缘模型更新方法，通过优化样本筛选和动态训练管理，提升实时视频分析的准确性和及时性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数据特征随时间变化导致模型准确性下降，现有方法在计算强度和模型对齐方面存在不足。

Method: EdgeSync通过结合时间性和推理结果优化样本筛选，并动态管理训练时机和顺序。

Result: 在多样复杂数据集上，EdgeSync比现有方法准确率提升约3.4%，比传统方法提升约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync有效解决了模型更新延迟和对齐问题，显著提升了实时视频分析的性能。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

### [10] [Promptable Fire Segmentation: Unleashing SAM2's Potential for Real-Time Mobile Deployment with Strategic Bounding Box Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21782)
*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了SAM2变体在火焰分割中的表现，发现边界框提示策略效果最佳，轻量级变体适合边缘部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割因火焰边界不规则、边缘半透明和强度多变而具挑战性，SAM2的跨域泛化能力在此领域的应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 系统评估了四种SAM2.1变体和两种移动优化变体，采用多种提示策略（如自动、单点、边界框等）在三个火焰数据集上进行测试。

Result: 边界框提示策略表现最优，Box+MP在Khan数据集上达到最高IoU（0.64）和Dice系数（0.75），轻量级变体降低了计算成本。

Conclusion: 研究为火焰监控系统中可提示分割模型的部署提供了关键见解，并为领域特定SAM应用设立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

### [11] [Noise Aggregation Analysis Driven by Small-Noise Injection: Efficient Membership Inference for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21783)
*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推断攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并评估噪声分布的聚合程度来区分训练集和非训练集样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型（如Stable Diffusion）的广泛应用带来了隐私风险，尤其是成员推断攻击可能泄露训练数据。

Method: 通过注入轻微噪声并分析模型预测噪声的聚合程度，判断样本是否属于训练集。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，且在大规模文本到图像扩散模型中ASR和AUC指标更优。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，适用于大规模扩散模型的隐私风险评估。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

### [12] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的相机姿态估计协方差下界闭式解方法，扩展了多智能体场景下的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作对密集或学习模型下的姿态估计不确定性量化不足，需要一种理论严谨且实用的方法。

Method: 通过将可微分渲染器视为测量函数，线性化图像形成过程，推导出渲染感知的Cramér-Rao下界。

Result: 方法在经典束调整不确定性基础上扩展，支持多智能体场景的Fisher信息融合。

Conclusion: 该方法为协同感知和新视角合成等任务提供了统计基础，无需显式关键点对应。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

*Qile Su,Shoutai Zhu,Shuai Zhang,Baoyu Liang,Chao Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出AVEP任务和EventFormer模型，用于视频事件预测，并发布了一个大型结构化数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注脚本事件预测，而视频事件预测缺乏相关研究，AVEP填补了这一空白。

Method: 提出EventFormer模型，基于节点-图层次注意力机制，捕捉事件与参数的关系。

Result: 实验表明EventFormer优于现有视频预测模型，验证了任务复杂性和数据集价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务和数据集为视频事件预测提供了新方向，EventFormer表现出色。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

### [14] [Mismatch reconstruction theory for unknown measurement matrix in imaging through multimode fiber bending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21787)
*Le Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的不匹配重建理论，解决了测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，通过设计匹配和校准算法构建新测量矩阵，实验证明其有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统重建算法需要严格匹配测量值和测量矩阵，但在实际应用中，测量矩阵常因系统配置未知或光纤弯曲后难以实时对齐而无法获取，导致重建失败。

Method: 提出不匹配方程，设计匹配和校准算法构建新测量矩阵，并在附录中详细证明方程和算法的正确性。

Result: 实验表明，低噪声下构建的矩阵可用于传统算法成功重建图像，且算法对噪声、计算精度和正交性具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 讨论了理论的局限性和潜在应用，代码已开源。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

*Niraj Chaudhari,Manmeet Singh,Naveen Sudharsan,Amit Kumar Srivastava,Harsh Kamath,Dushyant Mahajan,Ayan Paul*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文研究了扩散和流模型在卫星遥感数据融合中的应用，发现基于UNet的扩散模型能有效保留空间细节并生成高质量融合图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多源数据融合在卫星遥感中至关重要，但现有方法在保留细节和生成高保真图像方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用多种2D图像生成模型（如UNET、扩散和流模型）进行数据融合，并评估其效果。

Result: 基于UNet的扩散模型表现最佳，同时量化技术优化了内存和计算成本。

Conclusion: 研究为遥感数据融合提供了模型选择和噪声调度策略的实用建议。

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore

TL;DR: MAFR是一种新型无监督框架，通过融合RGB图像和点云数据，利用注意力机制实现跨模态融合，显著提升工业异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中，2D和3D数据的融合仍具挑战性，需要一种鲁棒的跨模态融合方法。

Method: 提出MAFR框架，使用共享融合编码器构建统一潜在空间，并通过注意力引导的解码器恢复输入特征，通过重建误差定位异常。

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD和Eyecandies基准测试中，MAFR分别达到0.972和0.901的I-AUROC，表现优异。

Conclusion: MAFR为视觉与几何信息融合提供了有效方法，提升了工业异常检测的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TITA（Token-level Inference-Time Alignment）是一种轻量级框架，通过冻结基础VLM并训练奖励模型来近似其分布，提供密集的自回归反馈，减少幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的微调或粗粒度反馈，TITA旨在提供更高效的token级对齐信号。

Method: TITA训练奖励模型，提取隐式偏好信号作为对数概率比，提供token级纠正信号。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如MMVet提升8.6%，POPE提升6.7%，同时推理开销可忽略。

Conclusion: TITA显著提升了VLM的通用理解能力并减少了幻觉问题，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为HIBA的分层交错块注意力机制，用于解决时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）在多尺度依赖捕获上的不足，并基于此构建了Xihe模型家族，在零样本迁移任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TSFMs直接迁移跨领域架构，难以有效捕捉时间序列数据的多尺度依赖，尤其在零样本迁移任务中表现受限。

Method: 提出HIBA机制，通过分层交错块稀疏注意力（包括块内和块间注意力）捕捉多尺度依赖，并构建了Xihe模型家族。

Result: Xihe模型在GIFT-Eval基准测试中表现优异，最小模型（9.5M参数）超越多数现有TSFMs，最大模型（1.5B参数）创下零样本性能新纪录。

Conclusion: HIBA架构在多尺度依赖捕获和零样本迁移任务中表现出卓越的泛化能力和架构优势。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Method: 使用Label Studio和AI零样本预标注技术，设计基于UCF-Crime数据集的测试。

Result: 预标注使70%的标注者时间减少35%，且标注质量与传统方法相当。

Conclusion: AI预标注能显著优化视频标注流程，提升一致性和效率。

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

Motivation: 膝骨关节炎（KOA）的诊断因细微形态特征难以捕捉而具有挑战性，需结合解剖结构提升准确性。

Method: 利用Segment Anything Model（SAM）生成形态图表示，结合视觉编码器，通过互信息最大化对齐几何图嵌入和放射特征。

Result: 在Osteoarthritis Initiative数据集上，准确率提升10%（达80%），优于现有方法8%（准确率）和11%（F1分数）。

Conclusion: 解剖结构的结合对KOA严重程度分级至关重要，多模态框架显著提升诊断性能。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

Motivation: 解决在有限去噪步骤下如何提升扩散模型采样质量的问题。

Method: 使用两个并行采样器在连续时间进行去噪步骤，并将信息整合到潜在图像中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能提升采样质量，但简单的信息整合会降低质量，且增加更多采样器不一定有帮助。

Conclusion: 提出的并行采样方法简单有效，适用于不同扩散模型，但需注意信息整合方式。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDA-CLIP是一种基于CLIP的文本-视频对齐框架，通过帧差动态区域掩码增强动态视频特征，抑制静态冗余特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法依赖大规模标注数据且模态差距大，CLIP的适应方法缺乏动态特征增强和静态冗余抑制。

Method: 提出FDA-CLIP，利用帧差生成动态区域掩码作为Alpha通道输入Alpha-CLIP，引导模型关注关键动态区域。

Result: 实验表明帧差引导的视频语义编码能有效平衡检索效率和准确性。

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP通过动态特征增强和静态冗余抑制，提升了文本-视频对齐性能。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有推理模型在单模态语言任务中表现良好，但在多模态场景（如视觉语言任务）中适应性不足，主要因为缺乏对视觉上下文和常识知识的充分利用。

Method: 提出Masked Prediction via Context and Commonsense（MPCC）任务，通过重建遮挡图像内容来整合视觉和常识推理；开发MPCC Eval评估基准；引入Reinforcement Fine-tuning with Prior Sampling（RFPS）训练方法。

Result: RFPS方法不仅提升了模型性能，还增强了其在OOD和跨任务场景中的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: MPCC任务和RFPS方法为多模态环境中的泛化推理提供了有效解决方案，填补了现有技术的空白。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Result: 在I2AwA和I2WebV基准测试中达到最优性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP有效解决了CLIP在DAZSL中的核心挑战，为数据受限场景下的深度学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

Result: 在多种导航任务中实现高性能的同时生成动作描述，并在语义视听导航任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了可解释性与性能之间的权衡问题，为多模态导航提供了新思路。

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变（DR）是糖尿病的严重并发症，早期无症状但可能导致不可逆的视力损失，因此早期筛查至关重要。

Method: 结合手工特征提取和深度学习，利用临床可解释数据和自动学习的特征，提升分类性能。

Result: 该混合模型在分类性能上优于单独的深度学习方法，并减少了假阴性。

Conclusion: 这种多模态AI驱动的方法为糖尿病高负担地区提供了可扩展且准确的DR筛查方案。

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,
speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches,
inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有地球观测（EO）基础模型需要额外适配且结构僵化的问题，借鉴大语言模型的统一序列建模思路。

Method: 采用GPT风格的解码器架构，通过符号提示实现多任务处理，利用训练数据的多样性和结构。

Result: 在作物类型分类任务（PASTIS-R）中表现优于现有大型EO基础模型。

Conclusion: SITS-DECO展示了数据多样性驱动的建模范式，为未来生成式EO基础模型提供了轻量级实践路径。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

Result: Gestura实现了鲁棒且适应性强的自由手势理解，并发布了首个开源数据集，包含30万标注QA对。

Conclusion: Gestura通过多模块协同显著提升了自由手势理解的准确性和效率，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

curators, the study assessed accuracy across personal attributes (age, hair),
appearance (attire, glasses), and paraphernalia (name tags, clipboards). While
correctly rendered in most cases, DALL-E3 deviated from prompt specifications
in 15.6% of all attributes (n=710). Errors were lowest for paraphernalia,
moderate for personal appearance, and highest for depictions of the person
themselves, particularly age. These findings demonstrate measurable

Method: 使用Haar和Daubechies小波滤波器预处理图像，再通过ResNet50分类层进行检测。

Result: Haar和Daubechies模型的准确率分别为93.8%和95.1%，高于空间域模型的81.5%。

Conclusion: 小波域分析能有效检测GAN图像，为未来深度伪造检测系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Identifying images generated by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has
become a significant challenge in digital image forensics. This research
presents a wavelet-based detection method that uses discrete wavelet transform
(DWT) preprocessing and a ResNet50 classification layer to differentiate the
StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Haar and Daubechies wavelet filters
are applied to convert the input images into multi-resolution representations,
which will then be fed to a ResNet50 network for classification, capitalizing
on subtle artifacts left by the generative process. Moreover, the wavelet-based
models are compared to an identical ResNet50 model trained on spatial data. The
Haar and Daubechies preprocessed models achieved a greater accuracy of 93.8
percent and 95.1 percent, much higher than the model developed in the spatial
domain (accuracy rate of 81.5 percent). The Daubechies-based model outperforms
Haar, showing that adding layers of descriptive frequency patterns can lead to
even greater distinguishing power. These results indicate that the
GAN-generated images have unique wavelet-domain artifacts or "fingerprints."
The method proposed illustrates the effectiveness of wavelet-domain analysis to
detect GAN images and emphasizes the potential of further developing the
capabilities of future deepfake detection systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习在医学影像中缺乏可解释性，阻碍临床信任的问题。

Method: 使用ResNet50和DenseNet121训练模型，并集成Grad-CAM生成热图。

Result: DenseNet121表现优于ResNet50，Grad-CAM显示其更关注核心病理区域。

Conclusion: 结合深度学习和可解释AI为临床诊断提供了可靠且透明的工具。

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

Motivation: 解决在资源有限的病理实验室中，由于高质量训练数据不足导致的染色体分类精度低的问题。

Result: 分类精度超过90%，尤其对常见缺陷和易位染色体效果显著。

Conclusion: 提出的方法适用于低质量G带数据库，为贫困国家和低预算实验室提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In the last decade, due to high resolution cameras and accurate meta-phase
analyzes, the accuracy of chromosome classification has improved substantially.
However, current Karyotyping systems demand large number of high quality train
data to have an adequately plausible Precision per each chromosome. Such
provision of high quality train data with accurate devices are not yet
accomplished in some out-reached pathological laboratories. To prevent false
positive detections in low-cost systems and low-quality images settings, this
paper improves the classification Precision of chromosomes using proposed
reliability thresholding metrics and deliberately engineered features. The
proposed method has been evaluated using a variation of deep Alex-Net neural
network, SVM, K Nearest-Neighbors, and their cascade pipelines to an automated
filtering of semi-straight chromosome. The classification results have highly
improved over 90% for the chromosomes with more common defections and
translocations. Furthermore, a comparative analysis over the proposed
thresholding metrics has been conducted and the best metric is bolded with its
salient characteristics. The high Precision results provided for a very
low-quality G-banding database verifies suitability of the proposed metrics and
pruning method for Karyotyping facilities in poor countries and lowbudget
pathological laboratories.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在理解和推理抽象视觉信息方面存在挑战，尤其是多模态关系知识（MMRK）和结构化抽象推理（STAR）任务。

Method: 开发了自动STAR数据引擎生成高质量多模态指令数据，并提出两阶段能力增强训练框架。

Result: 实验表明，3B/7B小模型通过该框架在STAR任务上显著优于GPT-4o，并提供了深入分析。

Conclusion: 论文填补了高质量数据和能力增强方法的双重空白，为STAR任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Motivation: 现实世界中的多模态医学数据常因采集限制或系统故障导致模态缺失，现有方法忽略模态间的分布差异，导致重建不一致。

Result: 在完整和不完整模态场景下均实现最优性能，重建数据与真实分布一致性显著提升。

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态生存分析中表现出鲁棒性和优越性，尤其在模态缺失情况下仍保持高精度。

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

Motivation: 全球垃圾管理需要高效的自动化分类方法，但目前缺乏系统性的基准测试，尤其是结合机器学习和深度学习的方法。

Method: 比较了三种方法：1) 基于手工特征的机器学习；2) 深度学习架构（如ResNet和EfficientNetV2S）；3) 混合方法（深度学习特征提取+经典分类器）。

Result: 混合方法在三个数据集上表现最优（最高100%准确率），且特征选择减少了95%的维度，提升了效率。

Conclusion: 研究提出了高效的混合框架，适用于资源受限环境，为垃圾分类提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 评估GPT-4o在零样本情况下对医学图像的分类能力，探索其在临床实践中的潜在应用。

Method: 使用400张平衡测试图像，比较四种不同提示设计的效果。

Result: 简洁的特征导向提示表现最佳（74%准确率），推理导向提示效果较差。

Conclusion: GPT-4o在医学图像解读方面有潜力，但需进一步改进视觉推理和领域适应能力才能用于临床。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非侵入式EEG解码因非平稳性、低信噪比和受试者变异性而具有挑战性，尤其是在最难受试者上表现不佳。

Method: RatioWaveNet结合了理性小波变换前端和多分辨率子带分解，通过CNN-Transformer混合架构提取时空特征。

Result: 在BCI-IV-2a和2b数据集上，RatioWaveNet显著提升了最差受试者的准确率，同时保持了计算效率。

Conclusion: 可训练小波前端是增强Transformer脑机接口的有效插件，提升了最坏情况下的可靠性。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) translate covert
movement intentions into actionable commands, yet reliable decoding from
non-invasive EEG remains challenging due to nonstationarity, low SNR, and
subject variability. We present RatioWaveNet, which augments a strong temporal
CNN-Transformer backbone (TCFormer) with a trainable, Rationally-Dilated
Wavelet Transform (RDWT) front end. The RDWT performs an undecimated,
multi-resolution subband decomposition that preserves temporal length and
shift-invariance, enhancing sensorimotor rhythms while mitigating jitter and
mild artifacts; subbands are fused via lightweight grouped 1-D convolutions and
passed to a multi-kernel CNN for local temporal-spatial feature extraction, a
grouped-query attention encoder for long-range context, and a compact TCN head
for causal temporal integration.
  Our goal is to test whether this principled wavelet front end improves
robustness precisely where BCIs typically fail - on the hardest subjects - and
whether such gains persist on average across seeds under both intra- and
inter-subject protocols. On BCI-IV-2a and BCI-IV-2b, across five seeds,
RatioWaveNet improves worst-subject accuracy over the Transformer backbone by
+0.17 / +0.42 percentage points (Sub-Dependent / LOSO) on 2a and by +1.07 /
+2.54 percentage points on 2b, with consistent average-case gains and modest
computational overhead. These results indicate that a simple, trainable wavelet
front end is an effective plug-in to strengthen Transformer-based BCIs,
improving worst-case reliability without sacrificing efficiency.

Motivation: 研究动机是揭示当前多模态模型在视觉和文本模态之间的系统性差异，以及这种差异对AI安全框架的潜在风险。

Method: 方法包括对前沿模型进行实验，生成电影艺术品的视觉再现并评估其文本描述能力，同时在合成数据集上进行控制实验。

Result: 结果表明模态失语症是当前统一多模态模型的基本属性，而非训练缺陷，且可能导致AI安全漏洞。

Conclusion: 结论指出模态失语症对多模态模型的可靠性构成挑战，并强调了跨模态安全对齐的重要性。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

Result: 显著降低内存使用，有效模拟人类阅读行为，提升多页文档问答能力。

Conclusion: SCoPE VLM 是首个显式建模代理阅读模式的多页文档问答框架，推动了多模态代理的能力。

Abstract: Understanding long-context visual information remains a fundamental challenge
for vision-language models, particularly in agentic tasks such as GUI control
and web navigation. While web pages and GUI environments are inherently
structured documents, current VLMs typically neglect decision-oriented document
understanding in their training objectives. Existing approaches primarily
extend visual embeddings to process long, high-resolution inputs, but these
methods are memory-intensive and impractical for locally deployable solutions.
To address these issues, we propose SCoPE VLM, a document navigation expert
that leverages a novel Chain of Scroll mechanism to selectively and recursively
navigate documents, focusing exclusively on relevant segments. We introduce a
dedicated data generation pipeline to construct informative Chain of Scroll
trajectories and Episodic Group Relative Policy Optimization, a tailored
reinforcement learning method to reduce the gap between training and inference.
Our method substantially reduces memory usage and effectively models human-like
reading behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, SCoPE VLM is the first
framework to explicitly model agentic reading patterns in multi-page document
question answering, advancing the capabilities of multimodal agents.

Motivation: PFCM只能通过蒸馏训练，限制了其潜力。研究旨在开发PFCT方法，使PFCM能够独立训练。

Method: 利用扰动核去除预训练的PFGM++，引入正弦离散化计划和Beta噪声分布以提高适应性。

Result: 在低剂量CT图像去噪中，PFCT在LPIPS和SSIM指标上表现优异，与一致性模型效果相当。

Conclusion: PFCT是一种有效的PFCM训练方法，具有潜力，但需进一步优化和扩展应用。

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Conclusion: 框架提供了可扩展的智能工程图纸分析方案，支持与CAD和制造数据库的无缝集成。

Abstract: Engineering drawings are fundamental to manufacturing communication, serving
as the primary medium for conveying design intent, tolerances, and production
details. However, interpreting complex multi-view drawings with dense
annotations remains challenging using manual methods, generic optical character
recognition (OCR) systems, or traditional deep learning approaches, due to
varied layouts, orientations, and mixed symbolic-textual content. To address
these challenges, this paper proposes a three-stage hybrid framework for the
automated interpretation of 2D multi-view engineering drawings using modern
detection and vision language models (VLMs). In the first stage, YOLOv11-det
performs layout segmentation to localize key regions such as views, title
blocks, and notes. The second stage uses YOLOv11-obb for orientation-aware,
fine-grained detection of annotations, including measures, GD&T symbols, and
surface roughness indicators. The third stage employs two Donut-based, OCR-free
VLMs for semantic content parsing: the Alphabetical VLM extracts textual and
categorical information from title blocks and notes, while the Numerical VLM
interprets quantitative data such as measures, GD&T frames, and surface
roughness. Two specialized datasets were developed to ensure robustness and
generalization: 1,000 drawings for layout detection and 1,406 for
annotation-level training. The Alphabetical VLM achieved an overall F1 score of
0.672, while the Numerical VLM reached 0.963, demonstrating strong performance
in textual and quantitative interpretation, respectively. The unified JSON
output enables seamless integration with CAD and manufacturing databases,
providing a scalable solution for intelligent engineering drawing analysis.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式标签，限制了泛化能力，且忽视了语音中的情感线索，导致动画自然性和适应性不足。

Method: 提出LSF-Animation框架，隐式提取情感和身份特征，并引入层次交互融合块（HIFB）整合多模态信息。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在情感表达、身份泛化和动画真实性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过隐式特征提取和高效融合机制，显著提升了语音驱动3D面部动画的性能。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在极端场景（corner cases）中表现不佳，主要由于训练数据中常见场景的过度代表和泛化能力有限。

Method: WM-MoE利用大型语言模型（LLMs）和轻量级时间标记器，结合混合专家（MoE）机制，分解复杂场景并分配专家处理。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，WM-MoE优于现有基线，并在极端场景和数据缺失条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于世界模型的架构为自动驾驶车辆提供了鲁棒且可泛化的运动预测解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and
healthier future.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed an increasing interest in image-text contrastive
modeling, exemplified by models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP). In this paper, we propose the TernaryCLIP, a lightweight computational
framework that converts connection weights of both vision and text encoders of
CLIP into the ternary format, instead of full-precision or floating ones.
TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency
computations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TernaryCLIP can
achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98
$\times$ compression ratio, 2.3 $\times$ inference acceleration, 16 $\times$
storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and
image-text retrieval tasks across 41 commonly used datasets. Our work
highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

TL;DR: SPRINT是一种高效扩散变换器（DiT）训练方法，通过分阶段训练和稀疏-密集残差融合，实现高达75%的token丢弃率，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DiT训练成本高的问题，现有token丢弃方法要么参数冗余，要么在高丢弃率下性能下降。

Method: SPRINT采用两阶段训练：长时掩码预训练和短时全token微调，结合浅层和深层互补作用。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，SPRINT节省9.8倍训练成本，推理时FLOPs减半且质量提升。

Conclusion: SPRINT是一种简单、高效且通用的DiT训练解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) deliver state-of-the-art generative performance
but their quadratic training cost with sequence length makes large-scale
pretraining prohibitively expensive. Token dropping can reduce training cost,
yet na\"ive strategies degrade representations, and existing methods are either
parameter-heavy or fail at high drop ratios. We present SPRINT, Sparse--Dense
Residual Fusion for Efficient Diffusion Transformers, a simple method that
enables aggressive token dropping (up to 75%) while preserving quality. SPRINT
leverages the complementary roles of shallow and deep layers: early layers
process all tokens to capture local detail, deeper layers operate on a sparse
subset to cut computation, and their outputs are fused through residual
connections. Training follows a two-stage schedule: long masked pre-training
for efficiency followed by short full-token fine-tuning to close the
train--inference gap. On ImageNet-1K 256x256, SPRINT achieves 9.8x training
savings with comparable FID/FDD, and at inference, its Path-Drop Guidance (PDG)
nearly halves FLOPs while improving quality. These results establish SPRINT as
a simple, effective, and general solution for efficient DiT training.

Conclusion: Lite-Diff为扩散模型的迁移学习提供了高效解决方案，适用于低数据领域。

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于扩散和流匹配模型的迭代采样过程计算成本高，现有方法难以直接控制最终生成的图像。

Method: FlowOpt将整个流过程视为黑盒，通过零阶优化在整个采样路径上进行优化，支持早期停止。

Result: FlowOpt在图像编辑任务中达到最先进效果，计算效率与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: FlowOpt提供了一种高效且灵活的方法，适用于图像编辑等控制生成任务。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Abstract: Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning
(ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and
improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is
to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an
image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be
misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel
spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates
a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image
pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting
caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the
most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the
standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly
towards developing robust ML models.

Motivation: 尽管VLMs在多模态内容评估中应用广泛，但其对幻灯片特定内容的理解尚未充分研究。

Result: VLMs在像素级提取和叙事结构理解上表现不佳，但在单幻灯片内容理解上表现较好。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在幻灯片评估中存在局限性，需开发更精准的评估方法以支持迭代优化。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used to evaluate multimodal
content, including presentation slides, yet their slide-specific understanding
remains underexplored {despite their growing role as critics in agentic,
model-forward pipelines}. We introduce VLM-SlideEval, an evaluation framework
that probes VLMs along three axes: (1) element-level extraction from slide
images aligned to ground truth; (2) robustness to controlled perturbations in
geometry, style, and text; and (3) higher-level comprehension, such as
recovering a deck's narrative order from shuffled slides. Using publicly
available decks from Zenodo
(https://huggingface.co/datasets/Forceless/Zenodo10K/viewer/default/pptx), we
standardize ground-truth element metadata from PowerPoint XML and live
renderings into a unified, verifiable schema. Empirically, VLMs underperform on
pixel-accurate extraction and show non-trivial agreement, fidelity, and
consistency under controlled perturbations, while performing better on
single-slide content understanding; however, they do not reliably capture
narrative structure across slides. These results highlight the limits of
current VLMs for slide evaluation and motivate calibrated, critic-in-the-loop
evaluators that drive iterative refinement and selection in agentic pipelines.

Result: 在五类UCF-Crime子集上，平均测试准确率达92.41%，各类F1分数均超过0.85。

Conclusion: 前景聚焦预处理显著提升了真实监控场景中的异常识别能力。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Motivation: 解决VLMs因过度依赖语言先验知识而导致的幻觉问题，同时避免视觉注意力分配不当和跨模态融合失衡。

Method: 提出GIFT方法，通过跟踪视觉注意力变化生成显著性图，增强对用户查询和视觉信息的关注。

Result: 实验表明GIFT在生成和分类任务中减少幻觉，性能提升20.7%，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: GIFT是一种简单有效的方法，能显著改善VLMs的幻觉问题，同时保持跨模态性能。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升跨站点图像一致性、解剖保真度和下游模型性能，为大规模多中心神经影像研究提供通用解决方案。

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率输入导致长令牌序列，削弱了位置编码并引入坐标输出的方向性偏差，影响了MLLMs的精确坐标预测能力。

Method: 通过扰动视觉位置编码（VPEs）分析模型行为，提出VPSG方法，利用辅助解码和轻量级有限状态机纠正偏差。

Result: 实验表明VPSG能有效改善坐标预测，尤其在ScreenSpot-Pro数据集上表现突出。

Conclusion: 位置编码的鲁棒性是MLLMs空间推理的关键因素，VPSG为解决这一问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在生成多样图像时难以区分有意义的差异或受限于语言可解释的多样性，Rainbow旨在解决这一问题。

Method: Rainbow利用GFlowNets构建潜在图，捕捉不确定性并生成多样轨迹，从而产生多样条件表示和图像。

Result: 在自然图像和医学图像数据集上，Rainbow在多样性和保真度方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: Rainbow有效解决了条件不确定性，提升了图像生成的多样性和质量。

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all
questions types, achieve improvements on several existing benchmarks such as
BLINK. The GRAID framework, datasets, and additional information can be found

### [61] [CogStereo: Neural Stereo Matching with Implicit Spatial Cognition Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22119)
*Lihuang Fang,Xiao Hu,Yuchen Zou,Hong Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogStereo是一种新型立体匹配框架，通过嵌入空间认知和双条件细化机制，解决了遮挡和弱纹理等挑战区域的问题，并在跨域泛化中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度立体匹配方法在基准数据集上表现良好，但在零样本泛化方面不如其他视觉任务的基础模型。CogStereo旨在解决这一问题，特别是在遮挡和弱纹理区域。

Method: CogStereo通过单目深度特征作为先验，嵌入隐式空间认知，并结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征的双条件细化机制，实现全局一致的视差估计。

Result: 在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury等多个数据集上的实验表明，CogStereo不仅达到最先进水平，还在跨域泛化中表现优异。

Conclusion: CogStereo推动了立体视觉向认知驱动方法的转变，为复杂场景下的视差估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究CLIP模型在输入损坏时的嵌入方差崩溃现象，并探索如何提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Mint方法，利用均值累加器和梯度累加器动态最大化伪标签的类间方差。

Result: Mint在多种损坏基准和CLIP架构中均能有效提升性能。

Conclusion: 通过最大化类间方差可以显著改善CLIP模型在输入损坏时的表现。

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

TL;DR: 论文提出了egoEMOTION数据集，首次将自我中心视觉与生理信号结合，用于情感和人格的密集自我报告，填补了现有基准忽略情感状态的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心视觉基准忽略情感状态，限制了系统捕捉行为内部驱动因素的能力。

Method: 通过Meta的Project Aria眼镜收集50小时数据，包括眼动视频、生理信号等，结合自我报告情感和人格数据。

Result: 传统学习方法在自我中心视觉系统上的情感预测优于生理信号处理。

Conclusion: egoEMOTION数据集确立了情感和人格在自我中心感知中的核心地位，为行为建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STG-Avatar是一个基于3D高斯散射（3DGS）的高保真可动画人体化身重建框架，通过结合刚性-非刚性耦合变形和光学流技术，显著提升了动态区域和非刚性物体的细节表现。

Method: 提出STG-Avatar框架，结合Spacetime Gaussians（STG）和线性混合蒙皮（LBS），并通过光学流识别高动态区域以指导3D高斯的自适应密集化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在重建质量和操作效率上均优于现有基线，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: STG-Avatar通过创新的混合设计，显著提升了人体化身的动画质量和真实感，为虚拟体验和人机交互提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D数据集稀缺问题，提升视觉语言模型在3D场景理解中的应用效果。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现高精度预测，并能区分未知类别。

Conclusion: LOC框架有效结合语言和视觉信息，提升开放集识别能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SFDA任务中，源数据的缺失和场景复杂性导致负迁移和域偏移问题，影响模型性能。

Method: 利用注意力机制捕捉目标对象的关键区域，通过空间和通道注意力分解实现跨层注意力残差融合和自蒸馏，对比全局和局部表征以提升感知能力，动态质心评估策略用于自监督自蒸馏。

Result: 在五个不同规模的基准测试中，ARFNet表现优于其他方法，取得了SFDA任务的优越性能。

Conclusion: ARFNet通过多模块协同有效缓解了负迁移和域偏移问题，显著提升了SFDA任务的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) involves training a model on source
domain and then applying it to a related target domain without access to the
source data and labels during adaptation. The complexity of scene information
and lack of the source domain make SFDA a difficult task. Recent studies have
shown promising results, but many approaches to domain adaptation concentrate
on domain shift and neglect the effects of negative transfer, which may impede
enhancements of model performance during adaptation. n this paper, addressing
this issue, we propose a novel framework of Attention Residual Fusion Network
(ARFNet) based on contrast learning for SFDA to alleviate negative transfer and
domain shift during the progress of adaptation, in which attention residual
fusion, global-local attention contrast, and dynamic centroid evaluation are
exploited. Concretely, the attention mechanism is first exploited to capture
the discriminative region of the target object. Then, in each block, attention
features are decomposed into spatial-wise and channel-wise attentions to
achieve the cross-layer attention residual fusion progressively and
self-distillation. During adaptation progress, we contrast global and local
representations to improve the perceptual capabilities of different categories,
which enables the model to discriminate variations between inner-class and
intra-class. Finally, a dynamic centroid evaluation strategy is exploited to
evaluate the trustworthy centroids and labels for self-supervised
self-distillation, which aims to accurately approximate the center of the
source domain and pseudo-labels to mitigate domain shift. To validate the
efficacy, we execute comprehensive experiments on five benchmarks of varying
scales. Experimental outcomes indicate that our method surpasses other
techniques, attaining superior performance across SFDA benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF模型主要依赖物体中心采样，无法在3D空间中实现均匀采样，且在复杂介质环境（如水下、雾霾）中表现不佳。

Method: 引入反向分层上采样策略实现近均匀采样，提出统一辐射公式（结合Beer-Lambert衰减定律）处理介质退化问题。

Result: 在真实数据集上，I2-NeRF显著提高了重建保真度和物理合理性。

Conclusion: I2-NeRF在复杂介质环境中实现了等距和各向同性度量感知，并能估计介质属性（如水深）。

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Result: 在三个VQA基准测试中表现优于现有方法，AUROC提升4%，PRR提升6%。

Conclusion: HARMONY通过多模态信息融合显著提升了不确定性估计性能。

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10上生成高保真样本，并揭示了部分-整体泛化的机制。

Conclusion: 该模型为自然图像结构提供了简约理论，并为大型神经网络生成模型的泛化机制提供了假设。

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Conclusion: MOGRAS为更逼真的人机交互铺平了道路。

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

Conclusion: 提出的框架和模型显著提高了轨迹预测的准确性，为建筑工地的碰撞避免系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As the demand grows within the construction industry for processes that are
not only faster but also safer and more efficient, offsite construction has
emerged as a solution, though it brings new safety risks due to the close
interaction between workers, machinery, and moving obstacles. Predicting the
future trajectories of workers and taking into account social and environmental
factors is a crucial step for developing collision-avoidance systems to
mitigate such risks. Traditional methods often struggle to adapt to the dynamic
and unpredictable nature of construction environments. Many rely on simplified
assumptions or require hand-crafted features, limiting their ability to respond
to complex, real-time interactions between workers and moving obstacles. While
recent data-driven methods have improved the modeling of temporal patterns,
they still face challenges in capturing long-term behavior and accounting for
the spatial and social context crucial to collision risk assessment. To address
these limitations, this paper proposes a framework integrating YOLOv10n and
DeepSORT for precise detection and tracking, along with two novel trajectory
prediction models: TrajGATFormer and TrajGATFormer-Obstacle. YOLOv10n serves as
the backbone for object detection, accurately identifying workers and obstacles
in diverse scenes, while DeepSORT efficiently tracks them over time with unique
IDs for continuity. Both models employ a transformer encoder-decoder with Graph
Attention Networks (GAT) to capture temporal and spatial interactions.
TrajGATFormer predicts worker trajectories with an ADE of 1.25 m and FDE of 2.3
m over a 4.8 s horizon, while TrajGATFormer-Obstacle extends prediction to both
workers and obstacles, achieving higher accuracy (ADE 1.15 m, FDE 2.2 m).
Comparative analysis shows both models outperform traditional methods, reducing
ADE and FDE by up to 35% and 38%, respectively.

Abstract: Generating dynamic and interactive 3D objects, such as trees, has wide
applications in virtual reality, games, and world simulation. Nevertheless,
existing methods still face various challenges in generating realistic 4D
motion for complex real trees. In this paper, we propose DynamicTree, the first
framework that can generate long-term, interactive animation of 3D Gaussian
Splatting trees. Unlike prior optimization-based methods, our approach
generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Result: 在三个标准DA基准测试中，GALA仅需1%的目标域标注即可达到接近全监督的性能。

Conclusion: GALA是一种即插即用的有效策略，无需额外参数即可提升现有DA框架的性能。

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在感知混淆环境中表现不佳，且计算成本高，需要更高效的解决方案。

Result: 在公开数据集和自建管道数据集上表现优异，计算效率高（16ms/图像）。

Conclusion: BoWG在精度、鲁棒性和计算效率上均优于现有方法，具有优秀扩展性。

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

Conclusion: UniPAN通过统一分布策略，解决了模型泛化问题，实现了“一次训练，永久部署”的目标。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Conclusion: 该方法在极低像素预算下有效提升了语义分割性能，结合多样性和不确定性的策略是关键。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Conclusion: EndoWave通过结合几何约束和小波监督，有效解决了内窥镜场景中的动态伪影问题，实现了高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Conclusion: DiffusionLane展示了强大的泛化能力和检测性能，优于现有方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

Abstract: Semantic segmentation has emerged as a fundamental problem in computer
vision, gaining particular importance in real-time applications such as
autonomous driving. The main challenge is achieving high accuracy while
operating under computational and hardware constraints. In this research, we
present an FPGA-based implementation of real-time semantic segmentation
leveraging the lightweight LMIINet architecture and the Coarse-Grained
Reconfigurable Array for Machine Learning (CGRA4ML) hardware framework. The
model was trained using Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) with 8-bit precision
on the Cityscapes dataset, reducing memory footprint by a factor of four while
enabling efficient fixed-point computations. Necessary modifications were
applied to adapt the model to CGRA4ML constraints, including simplifying skip
connections, employing hardware-friendly operations such as depthwise-separable
and 1A-1 convolutions, and redesigning parts of the Flatten Transformer. Our
implementation achieves approximately 90% pixel accuracy and 45% mean
Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), operating in real-time at 20 frames per second
(FPS) with 50.1 ms latency on the ZCU104 FPGA board. The results demonstrate
the potential of CGRA4ML, with its flexibility in mapping modern layers and
off-chip memory utilization for skip connections, provides a path for
implementing advanced semantic segmentation networks on FPGA for real-time
applications to outperform traditional GPU solutions in terms of power
efficiency while maintaining competitive accuracy. The code for this project is

Result: 实验表明，TIRE在身份保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TIRE为个性化3D/4D生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

Conclusion: 新方法通过直接预测未来风险分数和引入更严格的评估协议，显著提升了事故预测的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Result: 在CARGO数据集上，mAP和Rank-1分别提升18.8%和16.8%。

Conclusion: GSAlign有效解决了视角差异和遮挡问题，性能优于现有方法。

Abstract: Aerial-Ground person re-identification (AG-ReID) is an emerging yet
challenging task that aims to match pedestrian images captured from drastically
different viewpoints, typically from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
ground-based surveillance cameras. The task poses significant challenges due to
extreme viewpoint discrepancies, occlusions, and domain gaps between aerial and
ground imagery. While prior works have made progress by learning cross-view
representations, they remain limited in handling severe pose variations and
spatial misalignment. To address these issues, we propose a Geometric and
Semantic Alignment Network (GSAlign) tailored for AG-ReID. GSAlign introduces
two key components to jointly tackle geometric distortion and semantic
misalignment in aerial-ground matching: a Learnable Thin Plate Spline (LTPS)
Module and a Dynamic Alignment Module (DAM). The LTPS module adaptively warps
pedestrian features based on a set of learned keypoints, effectively
compensating for geometric variations caused by extreme viewpoint changes. In
parallel, the DAM estimates visibility-aware representation masks that
highlight visible body regions at the semantic level, thereby alleviating the
negative impact of occlusions and partial observations in cross-view
correspondence. A comprehensive evaluation on CARGO with four matching
protocols demonstrates the effectiveness of GSAlign, achieving significant
improvements of +18.8\% in mAP and +16.8\% in Rank-1 accuracy over previous
state-of-the-art methods on the aerial-ground setting. The code is available

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and

\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRPO-Guard通过归一化和梯度重加权解决了GRPO框架中重要性比率分布偏移的问题，稳定了优化过程并减少了隐式过优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GRPO框架中重要性比率分布偏移导致正优势样本无法进入裁剪区域，引发隐式过优化，影响模型实用性。

Method: 引入比率归一化和梯度重加权策略，平衡重要性比率分布并均衡梯度更新。

Result: GRPO-Guard显著减少过优化，同时保持或提升生成质量。

Conclusion: GRPO-Guard是一种简单有效的改进方法，无需依赖复杂的KL正则化即可稳定优化。

Abstract: Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in
optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with
task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on
importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative
gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the
importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs
substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution
prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing
the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a
result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization
stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as
image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making
the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we
introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO
frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a
balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping
properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a
gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions,
preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these
designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and
substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL
regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g.,
SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard
significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving
generation quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种将图论融入自监督表示学习的新方法，通过构建KNN图捕获样本间关系，结合GNN进行表示优化，在多个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自监督学习方法主要关注样本内部变化，忽略了样本间的重要关系。

Method: 在预训练阶段为师生网络构建KNN图表示样本关系，后通过GNN进行多跳消息传递优化表示。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、ImageNet-100和ImageNet-1K上分别取得7.3%、3.2%和1.0%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 基于图的机制能有效提升自监督学习性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates graph theory into
self-supervised representation learning. Traditional methods focus on
intra-instance variations generated by applying augmentations. However, they
often overlook important inter-instance relationships. While our method retains
the intra-instance property, it further captures inter-instance relationships
by constructing k-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs for both teacher and student
streams during pretraining. In these graphs, nodes represent samples along with
their latent representations. Edges encode the similarity between instances.
Following pretraining, a representation refinement phase is performed. In this
phase, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) propagate messages not only among immediate
neighbors but also across multiple hops, thereby enabling broader contextual
integration. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate accuracy improvements of 7.3%, 3.2%, and 1.0%, respectively, over
state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the effectiveness of the
proposed graph based mechanism. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 现有扩散方法将fMRI映射为单一高层嵌入，忽略了层次化神经信息与图像重建的阶段需求不匹配的问题。

Method: MindHier包含层次化fMRI编码器、层次对齐方案和尺度感知神经引导策略，支持从全局语义到局部细节的层次化重建。

Result: 在NSD数据集上，MindHier在语义保真度、推理速度（4.67倍）和确定性结果上优于扩散基线。

Conclusion: MindHier通过层次化重建过程，更符合人类视觉感知，为fMRI到图像重建提供了高效且认知对齐的解决方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&
product design and creative industries to control 3D object features accurately
in image space. Traditional 3D editing approaches are time-consuming and demand
specialized skills, while current image-based generative methods lack accuracy
in geometric conditioning. To address these challenges, we propose
GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various
iterative design workflows.

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of endoscopic surgery scenes plays a vital role in
enhancing scene perception, enabling AR visualization, and supporting
context-aware decision-making in image-guided surgery. A critical yet
challenging step in this process is the accurate estimation of the endoscope's
intrinsic parameters. In real surgical settings, intrinsic calibration is
hindered by sterility constraints and the use of specialized endoscopes with
continuous zoom and telescope rotation. Most existing methods for endoscopic 3D
reconstruction do not estimate intrinsic parameters, limiting their
effectiveness for accurate and reliable reconstruction. In this paper, we
integrate intrinsic parameter estimation into a self-supervised monocular depth
estimation framework by adapting the Depth Anything V2 (DA2) model for joint
depth, pose, and intrinsics prediction. We introduce an attention-based pose
network and a Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) strategy for
efficient fine-tuning of DA2. Our method is validated on the SCARED and C3VD
public datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to recent
state-of-the-art approaches in self-supervised monocular depth estimation and
3D reconstruction. Code and model weights can be found in project repository:

Result: 实验表明，T2SMark在U-Net和DiT骨干的扩散模型中实现了鲁棒性和多样性的最优平衡。

Conclusion: T2SMark为扩散模型提供了一种高效的水印方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced rapidly in recent years, producing
high-fidelity images while raising concerns about intellectual property
protection and the misuse of generative AI. Image watermarking for diffusion
models, particularly Noise-as-Watermark (NaW) methods, encode watermark as
specific standard Gaussian noise vector for image generation, embedding the
infomation seamlessly while maintaining image quality. For detection, the
generation process is inverted to recover the initial noise vector containing
the watermark before extraction. However, existing NaW methods struggle to
balance watermark robustness with generation diversity. Some methods achieve
strong robustness by heavily constraining initial noise sampling, which
degrades user experience, while others preserve diversity but prove too fragile
for real-world deployment. To address this issue, we propose T2SMark, a
two-stage watermarking scheme based on Tail-Truncated Sampling (TTS). Unlike
prior methods that simply map bits to positive or negative values, TTS enhances
robustness by embedding bits exclusively in the reliable tail regions while
randomly sampling the central zone to preserve the latent distribution. Our
two-stage framework then ensures sampling diversity by integrating a randomly
generated session key into both encryption pipelines. We evaluate T2SMark on
diffusion models with both U-Net and DiT backbones. Extensive experiments show
that it achieves an optimal balance between robustness and diversity. Our code

Motivation: 传统卷积网络缺乏直接建模体素对应关系的能力，而现有方法在处理大变形时效率不足。

Method: 采用循环相关框架，动态调整匹配区域，结合轻量级循环更新模块和解耦特征。

Result: 在脑MRI和腹部CT数据集上表现优异，计算效率显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在精度和计算效率上达到或超越现有最优方法。

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述任务中存在全局叙事连贯性与细节捕捉的矛盾，难以处理多步骤复杂场景描述。

Method: 将图像描述任务重新定义为目标导向的分层细化规划问题，提出TDSR框架，结合视觉引导的并行扩展和轻量级价值网络，优化MCTS算法。

Conclusion: TDSR作为一种即插即用模块，有效解决了大型视觉语言模型在复杂场景描述中的局限性，为未来研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

Abstract: There has been a surge of interest in assistive wearable agents: agents
embodied in wearable form factors (e.g., smart glasses) who take assistive
actions toward a user's goal/query (e.g. "Where did I leave my keys?"). In this
work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in

solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to train a lightweight student model by
transferring knowledge from a large, high-capacity teacher. Recent studies have
shown that leveraging diverse teacher perspectives can significantly improve
distillation performance; however, achieving such diversity typically requires
multiple teacher networks, leading to high computational costs. In this work,
we propose a novel cost-efficient knowledge augmentation method for KD that
generates diverse multi-views by attaching multiple branches to a single
teacher. To ensure meaningful semantic variation across multi-views, we
introduce two angular diversity objectives: 1) constrained inter-angle
diversify loss, which maximizes angles between augmented views while preserving
proximity to the original teacher output, and 2) intra-angle diversify loss,
which encourages an even distribution of views around the original output. The
ensembled knowledge from these angularly diverse views, along with the original
teacher, is distilled into the student. We further theoretically demonstrate
that our objectives increase the diversity among ensemble members and thereby
reduce the upper bound of the ensemble's expected loss, leading to more
effective distillation. Experimental results show that our method surpasses an
existing knowledge augmentation method across diverse configurations. Moreover,
the proposed method is compatible with other KD frameworks in a plug-and-play
fashion, providing consistent improvements in generalization performance.

T1-weighted images (T1w), which are less sensitive to PD pathology than
Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM), a phase-based MRI technique that
quantifies iron deposition in deep gray matter nuclei. In this study, we
propose GateFuseNet, an adaptive 3D multimodal fusion network that integrates
QSM and T1w images for PD diagnosis. The core innovation lies in a gated fusion
module that learns modality-specific attention weights and channel-wise gating
vectors for selective feature modulation. This hierarchical gating mechanism
enhances ROI-aware features while suppressing irrelevant signals. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms three existing state-of-the-art
approaches, achieving 85.00% accuracy and 92.06% AUC. Ablation studies further
validate the contributions of ROI guidance, multimodal integration, and fusion
positioning. Grad-CAM visualizations confirm the model's focus on clinically
relevant pathological regions. The source codes and pretrained models can be

TL;DR: ORIG是一个开放多模态检索增强框架，用于解决大模型生成图像时与可验证知识矛盾的问题，显著提高了事实一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大模型生成的图像常与可验证知识矛盾，尤其是在细粒度属性或时间敏感事件上。现有检索增强方法依赖静态知识源，无法解决这一问题。

Method: ORIG通过迭代检索和过滤多模态证据，逐步将精炼知识融入提示词以指导生成。

Result: 实验表明，ORIG在事实一致性和图像质量上显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 开放多模态检索在事实图像生成中具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
generating photorealistic and prompt-aligned images, but they often produce
outputs that contradict verifiable knowledge, especially when prompts involve
fine-grained attributes or time-sensitive events. Conventional
retrieval-augmented approaches attempt to address this issue by introducing
external information, yet they are fundamentally incapable of grounding
generation in accurate and evolving knowledge due to their reliance on static
sources and shallow evidence integration. To bridge this gap, we introduce
ORIG, an agentic open multimodal retrieval-augmented framework for Factual
Image Generation (FIG), a new task that requires both visual realism and
factual grounding. ORIG iteratively retrieves and filters multimodal evidence
from the web and incrementally integrates the refined knowledge into enriched
prompts to guide generation. To support systematic evaluation, we build
FIG-Eval, a benchmark spanning ten categories across perceptual, compositional,
and temporal dimensions. Experiments demonstrate that ORIG substantially
improves factual consistency and overall image quality over strong baselines,
highlighting the potential of open multimodal retrieval for factual image
generation.

TL;DR: AesCrop是一种结合VMamba图像编码器和MCAB的新型图像裁剪模型，通过显式编码构图线索，生成多样且高质量的裁剪结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合方法缺乏摄影构图指导，而构图是影响视觉吸引力的关键因素。

Method: AesCrop整合VMamba编码器、MCAB和Transformer解码器，进行端到端基于排名的图像裁剪。

Result: AesCrop在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AesCrop通过显式构图指导，实现了更优的多样性和全局性。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的空间重聚焦超分辨率（SRSR）框架，通过改进文本条件和选择性引导，解决了现有扩散模型在超分辨率任务中的语义模糊和幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在超分辨率任务中因文本条件不准确和交叉注意力分散导致语义模糊和幻觉细节，需改进。

Method: SRSR框架包含空间重聚焦交叉注意力（SRCA）和空间目标无分类器引导（STCFG），分别优化文本条件和选择性引导。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SRSR在保真度（PSNR、SSIM）和感知质量（LPIPS、DISTS）指标上均优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中实现了高语义保真度和感知质量，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: STATUS Bench是首个用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在多样情境下识别物体细微状态变化能力的基准，包含三个任务：物体状态识别（OSI）、图像检索（IR）和状态变化识别（SCI）。实验表明当前VLMs在此任务上表现不佳，但通过STATUS Train数据集微调后性能显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在识别物体细微状态变化方面的能力尚不明确，需要一种严谨的评估方法。

Method: 提出STATUS Bench基准，包含三个任务（OSI、IR、SCI），并基于手工标注的图像对和描述构建数据集。同时引入STATUS Train（1300万条半自动生成描述）作为训练资源。

Result: 实验显示当前VLMs在STATUS Bench上表现不佳（零样本性能接近随机水平），但通过STATUS Train微调后，Qwen2.5-VL性能接近Gemini 2.0 Flash。

Conclusion: STATUS Bench和Train为VLM研究提供了必要的评估和训练资源，揭示了当前模型在物体状态识别任务上的不足，并展示了微调后的潜力。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准上，PSNR提升了7.7%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了XLFM重建的核心问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在边缘设备上部署时因计算资源密集而受限的问题。

Method: 结合层次知识蒸馏（HD-CVGL）和不确定性感知预测对齐（UAPA）进行训练，推理时使用多视角优化模块（MRM）。

Conclusion: PFED在精度和效率上均达到最优，适用于实时无人机应用。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖完全标记或单域数据集，无法处理多部分标记数据集和不同分布问题。

Method: 采用三分支架构（一个教师和两个学生网络），结合低频丢弃和低频不确定性策略增强域鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个眼底数据集上表现优异，具有卓越的域泛化能力，且兼容多种骨干网络。

Conclusion: PSScreen V2在性能和通用性上均优于现有方法，适用于多种医学图像任务。

Abstract: In this work, we propose PSScreen V2, a partially supervised self-training
framework for multiple retinal disease screening. Unlike previous methods that
rely on fully labelled or single-domain datasets, PSScreen V2 is designed to
learn from multiple partially labelled datasets with different distributions,
addressing both label absence and domain shift challenges. To this end,
PSScreen V2 adopts a three-branch architecture with one teacher and two student
networks. The teacher branch generates pseudo labels from weakly augmented
images to address missing labels, while the two student branches introduce
novel feature augmentation strategies: Low-Frequency Dropout (LF-Dropout),
which enhances domain robustness by randomly discarding domain-related
low-frequency components, and Low-Frequency Uncertainty (LF-Uncert), which
estimates uncertain domain variability via adversarially learned Gaussian
perturbations of low-frequency statistics. Extensive experiments on multiple
in-domain and out-of-domain fundus datasets demonstrate that PSScreen V2
achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior domain generalization
ability. Furthermore, compatibility tests with diverse backbones, including the
vision foundation model DINOv2, as well as evaluations on chest X-ray datasets,
highlight the universality and adaptability of the proposed framework. The
codes are available at https://github.com/boyiZheng99/PSScreen_V2.

Motivation: 解决CT图像重建中数据一致性问题，提升重建质量和细节恢复。

Method: 提出PEDB方法，嵌入投影数据到反向SDE的得分函数中，并设计离散化方案以减少误差。

Result: 在稀疏视图、有限角度和截断投影三种不完整数据下，PEDB表现优于现有扩散桥模型。

Conclusion: PEDB通过数据一致性显著提升了CT重建性能，适用于多种不完整数据场景。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

Motivation: 利用小波基空间的自监督学习范式，挖掘高光谱图像中的潜在对称性，实现无需地面真实数据的训练。

Result: 在合成和真实高光谱数据集上表现优于现有神经网络解混方法。

Conclusion: SWAN通过自监督和紧凑网络参数提升了性能，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: In this article, we present SWAN: a three-stage, self-supervised wavelet
neural network for joint estimation of endmembers and abundances from
hyperspectral imagery. The contiguous and overlapping hyperspectral band images
are first expanded to Biorthogonal wavelet basis space that provides sparse,
distributed, and multi-scale representations. The idea is to exploit latent
symmetries from thus obtained invariant and covariant features using a
self-supervised learning paradigm. The first stage, SWANencoder maps the input
wavelet coefficients to a compact lower-dimensional latent space. The second
stage, SWANdecoder uses the derived latent representation to reconstruct the
input wavelet coefficients. Interestingly, the third stage SWANforward learns
the underlying physics of the hyperspectral image. A three-stage combined loss
function is formulated in the image acquisition domain that eliminates the need
for ground truth and enables self-supervised training. Adam is employed for
optimizing the proposed loss function, while Sigmoid with a dropout of 0.3 is
incorporated to avoid possible overfitting. Kernel regularizers bound the
magnitudes and preserve spatial variations in the estimated endmember
coefficients. The output of SWANencoder represents estimated abundance maps
during inference, while weights of SWANdecoder are retrieved to extract
endmembers. Experiments are conducted on two benchmark synthetic data sets with
different signal-to-noise ratios as well as on three real benchmark
hyperspectral data sets while comparing the results with several
state-of-the-art neural network-based unmixing methods. The qualitative,
quantitative, and ablation results show performance enhancement by learning a
resilient unmixing function as well as promoting self-supervision and compact
network parameters for practical applications.

Conclusion: 需优先考虑农业AI设计，注重农场真实性和跨环境鲁棒性，推动可信赖的动物监测技术。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and
specificity 80.9% on the official test set. These results indicate that
combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive
objectives yields a robust, domain-generalizable framework for atypical mitosis
classification suitable for real-world computational pathology workflows.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像合成中表现出色，但对其输出进行精确控制仍具挑战性。现有方法效率低。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多个数据集上实现高质量编辑，编辑时间减少60%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且无需额外资源，为扩散模型的可控性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable fidelity in image synthesis, yet precise
control over their outputs for targeted editing remains challenging. A key step
toward controllability is to identify interpretable directions in the model's
latent representations that correspond to semantic attributes. Existing
approaches for finding interpretable directions typically rely on sampling
large sets of images or training auxiliary networks, which limits efficiency.
We propose an analytical method that derives semantic editing directions
directly from the pretrained parameters of diffusion models, requiring neither
additional data nor fine-tuning. Our insight is that self-attention weight
matrices encode rich structural information about the data distribution learned
during training. By computing the eigenvectors of these weight matrices, we
obtain robust and interpretable editing directions. Experiments demonstrate
that our method produces high-quality edits across multiple datasets while

*Qiwei Ma,Zhiyu Wang,Wang Liu,Xukun Lu,Bin Deng,Puhong Duan,Xudong Kang,Shutao Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARCLIP-1M数据集和SARCLIP模型填补了SAR领域多模态对齐和零样本识别的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SAR基础模型主要关注低层视觉特征，忽视了多模态对齐和零样本目标识别。

Method: 构建了SARCLIP-1M数据集，并采用对比学习方法和领域迁移策略训练SARCLIP模型。

Result: SARCLIP在图像-文本检索和零样本分类任务中表现优异，显著优于现有基础模型。

Conclusion: SARCLIP提升了SAR图像的语义理解能力，相关代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVD-GS是一种新型的LiDAR-Visual 3D高斯溅射SLAM系统，通过分层协作表示模块和联合动态建模模块，解决了大规模动态户外场景中的尺度漂移和动态对象干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖单一表示方案，导致在大规模动态户外场景中性能受限，出现累积姿态误差和尺度模糊问题。

Method: 引入分层协作表示模块优化映射，并提出联合动态建模模块，融合开放世界分割与隐式残差约束生成动态掩码。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和自采集数据集上的评估表明，LVD-GS性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: LVD-GS通过多模态协作和动态建模，显著提升了SLAM系统的鲁棒性和精度。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

### [120] [Alias-Free ViT: Fractional Shift Invariance via Linear Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22673)
*Hagay Michaeli,Daniel Soudry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种Alias-Free ViT，通过无混叠下采样和非线性操作，结合线性交叉协方差注意力，提升了ViT的平移不变性和对抗平移鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT缺乏卷积网络的平移不变性，对微小图像平移更敏感，限制了其性能。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合无混叠下采样和非线性操作，使用线性交叉协方差注意力，确保对整数和分数平移的平移等变性。

Result: 模型在图像分类中保持竞争力，并在对抗平移鲁棒性上优于类似规模模型。

Conclusion: Alias-Free ViT通过改进平移不变性，提升了ViT的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a competitive alternative to convnets in vision
tasks, yet they lack the architectural inductive bias of convnets, which may
hinder their potential performance. Specifically, Vision Transformers (ViTs)
are not translation-invariant and are more sensitive to minor image
translations than standard convnets. Previous studies have shown, however, that
convnets are also not perfectly shift-invariant, due to aliasing in
downsampling and nonlinear layers. Consequently, anti-aliasing approaches have
been proposed to certify convnets' translation robustness. Building on this
line of work, we propose an Alias-Free ViT, which combines two main components.
First, it uses alias-free downsampling and nonlinearities. Second, it uses
linear cross-covariance attention that is shift-equivariant to both integer and
fractional translations, enabling a shift-invariant global representation. Our
model maintains competitive performance in image classification and outperforms
similar-sized models in terms of robustness to adversarial translations.

TL;DR: DAMap方法通过DAFL、HLS和TMDA三个组件解决了高精地图预测中的任务不对齐问题，提升了分类和定位质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在高精地图预测中存在任务不对齐问题，主要由于标签分配和特征采样机制不当。

Result: 在NuScenes和Argoverse2基准测试中表现优异，性能显著提升。

Conclusion: DAMap有效解决了任务不对齐问题，提升了高精地图预测的质量。

Abstract: Predicting High-definition (HD) map elements with high quality (high
classification and localization scores) is crucial to the safety of autonomous
driving vehicles. However, current methods perform poorly in high quality
predictions due to inherent task misalignment. Two main factors are responsible
for misalignment: 1) inappropriate task labels due to one-to-many matching
queries sharing the same labels, and 2) sub-optimal task features due to
task-shared sampling mechanism. In this paper, we reveal two inherent defects
in current methods and develop a novel HD map construction method named DAMap
to address these problems. Specifically, DAMap consists of three components:
Distance-aware Focal Loss (DAFL), Hybrid Loss Scheme (HLS), and Task Modulated
Deformable Attention (TMDA). The DAFL is introduced to assign appropriate
classification labels for one-to-many matching samples. The TMDA is proposed to
obtain discriminative task-specific features. Furthermore, the HLS is proposed
to better utilize the advantages of the DAFL. We perform extensive experiments
and consistently achieve performance improvement on the NuScenes and Argoverse2
benchmarks under different metrics, baselines, splits, backbones, and
schedules. Code will be available at https://github.com/jpdong-xjtu/DAMap.

Motivation: 日本建筑的关键元数据（如建筑年份和结构类型）常缺失或过时，尤其在二手房市场，影响灾害风险评估和保险定价。

Method: 使用多任务学习模型，从立面图像联合预测建筑年份、结构和类型，并通过规则映射推断防火等级（H、T或M）。

Result: 模型在建筑年份回归和分类任务中表现优异，能捕捉建筑年龄和材料的视觉特征。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了基于图像的可扩展、可解释的风险分析系统的可行性，适用于保险、城市规划和灾害准备。

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

Conclusion: RoboSVG为多功能SVG生成设立了新标准，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.
The dataset and source code of this project will be publicly available soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree提出了一种基于HGTree结构的灵活采样方法，用于视频异常检测，结合预训练模型和语言交互性，显著提升了性能并减少了采样片段数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉不同时间跨度的异常时表现不佳，且缺乏解释性。VADTree旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用预训练的GEBD模型分解视频为事件节点，构建HGTree结构，结合VLMs和LLMs进行异常感知和推理。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现了SOTA性能，同时大幅减少了采样片段数量。

Conclusion: VADTree在训练自由设置下表现出色，为视频异常检测提供了高效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Motivation: 现有MRAG方法存在静态检索策略、模态选择不灵活和检索信息利用不足的问题。

Method: 提出Windsock模块决定检索需求和模态选择，DANCE指令调优增强噪声鲁棒性，并利用自评估方法生成训练数据。

Result: 生成质量提升17.07%，检索次数减少8.95%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MRAG的关键挑战，提升了性能和效率。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

TL;DR: WaveMAE是一种针对多光谱卫星图像的掩码自编码框架，通过离散小波变换和地理条件位置编码提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于遥感数据标注稀缺，自监督学习成为构建基础模型的关键策略。

Method: WaveMAE利用多级离散小波变换分离频率成分，并引入地理条件位置编码结合地理先验。

Result: WaveMAE在多个下游任务中表现优异，轻量版也能达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: WaveMAE是一种强大且地理信息感知的多光谱遥感基础模型。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将几何重建与语义理解分离，导致泛化能力差，下游任务性能不佳。

Method: 设计3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning策略，构建InsScene-15K数据集。

Result: IGGT能通过2D输入生成一致3D场景，并区分实例。

Conclusion: IGGT统一几何与语义理解，提升下游任务性能。

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

Result: 在DFUC2021和DFU数据集上表现优于现有CNN和ViT模型，单次实验准确率达0.8961，4折交叉验证准确率达0.9755。

Conclusion: ConMatFormer为DFU分类设立了新基准，并为医学图像分析提供了可解释的混合注意力Transformer框架。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SCC的自校准一致性方法，用于提升CLIP等预训练视觉语言模型在零样本设置下的对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法存在语义和视角脆弱性，且防御方法通常依赖标注数据进行对抗微调，限制了在零样本场景中的应用。

Method: SCC包含语义一致性和空间一致性两个模块，分别通过伪标签和多视角预测增强跨模态对齐，以及通过增强视图稳定对抗扰动下的推理。

Result: 在22个基准测试中，SCC显著提升了CLIP的零样本鲁棒性，同时保持了准确性，并可与其他视觉语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: SCC展示了从CLIP建立对抗鲁棒范式的潜力，对更广泛的视觉语言领域（如BioMedCLIP）具有重要影响。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

medical image analysis. The framework leverages a fine-tuned BLIP-2 backbone,
medical query reformulation, enhanced Grad-CAM attention, precise region
extraction, and structured chain-of-thought reasoning via multi-modal language
models. To evaluate the system, we introduce a medical-domain-specific
framework replacing traditional NLP metrics with clinically relevant
assessments, including terminology coverage, clinical structure quality, and
attention region relevance. Experiments on 500 PathVQA histopathology samples
demonstrate substantial improvements, with the enhanced system achieving a
composite score of 0.683 compared to 0.378 for baseline methods, while
maintaining high reasoning confidence (0.890). Our system identifies 3-5
diagnostically relevant regions per sample and generates structured
explanations averaging 57 words with appropriate clinical terminology. Ablation
studies reveal that query reformulation provides the most significant initial
improvement, while chain-of-thought reasoning enables systematic diagnostic
processes. These findings underscore the potential of MedXplain-VQA as a
robust, explainable medical VQA system. Future work will focus on validation
with medical experts and large-scale clinical datasets to ensure clinical
readiness.

*Fatemeh Nazarieh,Zhenhua Feng,Diptesh Kanojia,Muhammad Awais,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk是一种基于扩散模型的单样本框架，用于生成可定制且时间稳定的说话人脸视频，解决了身份保持、时间一致性和长视频生成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在音频-嘴唇同步方面有所改进，但在时间一致性、身份保持和定制化方面存在不足，尤其是在生成长视频时。

Method: MAGIC-Talk包含ReferenceNet（通过文本提示保留身份和精细面部编辑）和AnimateNet（利用结构化运动先验增强运动连贯性），并采用渐进潜在融合策略减少运动不一致和闪烁。

Result: 实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

### [134] [FairJudge: MLLM Judging for Social Attributes and Prompt Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22827)
*Zahraa Al Sahili,Maryam Fetanat,Maimuna Nowaz,Ioannis Patras,Matthew Purver*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FairJudge是一个轻量级协议，通过多模态LLM评估文本到图像系统的公平性，提供可解释的评分和证据支持，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像（T2I）系统缺乏简单、可重复的方法来评估图像与提示的匹配程度以及模型对社会属性的处理。现有方法（如面部分类器和对比相似性）仅关注表面线索，缺乏校准的弃权机制，且忽略弱可见属性（如宗教、文化、残疾）。

Method: FairJudge将指令跟随的多模态LLM视为公平的评判者，使用解释导向的评分标准（-1到1），约束判断为封闭标签集，要求证据基于可见内容，并在线索不足时强制弃权。

Result: FairJudge在性别、种族、年龄等数据集上优于对比和面部中心基线，提高了平均对齐度，同时保持高职业准确性，支持更可靠、可重复的公平性审计。

Conclusion: FairJudge提供了一种更可靠、可解释的评估方法，适用于多模态系统的公平性审计，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Motivation: 解决MediaEval 2025竞赛中广告记忆性预测任务，探索多模态融合和LLM在记忆性预测中的应用。

Method: 使用Gemma-3 LLM作为主干，整合视觉（ViT）和文本（E5）特征，通过多模态投影和LoRA进行适配，并利用LLM生成理性提示指导模型。

Result: LLM系统在最终测试集上表现出更强的鲁棒性和泛化性能，优于梯度提升树基线。

Conclusion: 多模态融合和LLM生成的理性提示能有效提升广告记忆性预测性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

TL;DR: SP-CSVR框架通过解耦风格与内容，提升多风格视觉语义理解的鲁棒性和适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大视觉语言模型在多样视觉风格中语义理解的挑战，尤其是上下文学习中的风格陷阱问题。

Method: 提出SP-CSVR框架，包含跨风格特征编码器、语义对齐上下文解码器和自适应语义一致性模块。

Result: 在多风格数据集上，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、问答和风格适应任务中表现最优。

Conclusion: SP-CSVR显著提升了多风格视觉任务的鲁棒性、泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastJAM是一种基于图的快速联合对齐方法，显著降低了计算复杂度，无需正则化项和超参数调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联合对齐方法通常需要长时间训练、大容量模型和大量超参数调优，FastJAM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 利用现成的图像匹配器计算成对匹配，通过非参数聚类构建图表示关键点关系，使用图神经网络传播和聚合对应关系，预测单应性参数。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，FastJAM在对齐质量和计算时间上优于现有方法，将计算时间从小时或分钟缩短至秒级。

Conclusion: FastJAM是一种高效、快速的联合对齐方法，适用于需要快速对齐的场景。

Abstract: Joint Alignment (JA) of images aims to align a collection of images into a
unified coordinate frame, such that semantically-similar features appear at
corresponding spatial locations. Most existing approaches often require long
training times, large-capacity models, and extensive hyperparameter tuning. We
introduce FastJAM, a rapid, graph-based method that drastically reduces the
computational complexity of joint alignment tasks. FastJAM leverages pairwise
matches computed by an off-the-shelf image matcher, together with a rapid
nonparametric clustering, to construct a graph representing intra- and
inter-image keypoint relations. A graph neural network propagates and
aggregates these correspondences, efficiently predicting per-image homography
parameters via image-level pooling. Utilizing an inverse-compositional loss,
that eliminates the need for a regularization term over the predicted
transformations (and thus also obviates the hyperparameter tuning associated
with such terms), FastJAM performs image JA quickly and effectively.
Experimental results on several benchmarks demonstrate that FastJAM achieves
results better than existing modern JA methods in terms of alignment quality,
while reducing computation time from hours or minutes to mere seconds. Our code
is available at our project webpage, https://bgu-cs-vil.github.io/FastJAM/

*Lexiang Xiong,Chengyu Liu,Jingwen Ye,Yan Liu,Yuecong Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Semantic Surgery是一种无需训练、零样本的概念擦除框架，通过动态调整文本嵌入来中和目标概念的影响，显著提升了擦除效果和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本到图像扩散模型中擦除有害内容时往往牺牲生成质量，因此需要一种更高效且不影响质量的方法。

Method: 提出Semantic Surgery框架，直接在扩散过程前对文本嵌入进行校准向量减法，包括共现编码模块和视觉反馈循环。

Result: 在多种擦除任务中表现优异（如93.58 H-score），同时保持图像质量，还能作为威胁检测系统。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery是一种高效、动态且实用的概念擦除解决方案。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于检索增强生成（RAG）和视觉语言模型（VLM）的零样本风电叶片损伤检测框架，减少了对大规模标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电叶片在恶劣环境中运行，传统基于无人机和深度学习的方法依赖大量标注数据，难以检测罕见或新型损伤。

Method: 构建多模态知识库，结合文本和图像检索器，通过RAG增强VLM的推理能力，无需任务特定训练。

Result: 在30张叶片图像测试集上，RAG增强的VLM分类准确率显著优于无检索的VLM，并能检测未见过的缺陷。

Conclusion: 该框架通过领域知识增强模型解释性和泛化能力，为工业检测提供了一种数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精确估计牧场生物量对畜牧业决策至关重要，可优化放牧率，避免过度放牧并提升系统健康。

Result: 数据集结合了视觉、光谱和结构信息，为精准放牧管理提供了新可能。

Conclusion: 数据集已发布在Kaggle竞赛中，旨在推动机器学习在牧场生物量估计中的应用。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in
livestock production systems. Estimates of pasture biomass can be used to
manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in
a Kaggle competition that challenges the international Machine Learning
community with the task of pasture biomass estimation. The dataset is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法（如LangSplat）因需场景特定自编码器训练而导致的效率低和可扩展性差的问题。

Method: 使用预训练的通用自编码器替代场景特定自编码器，固定潜在空间，无需新场景训练。

Result: 在保持或超越LangSplat查询性能的同时，显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入能高效支持新3D场景的开放词汇查询，推动实时交互3D AI应用的发展。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PPE的新型编码算子，通过保留时空结构来压缩视觉标记，提升多模态大语言模型的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有标记合并方法在减少序列长度时破坏了空间布局和时间连续性，影响了性能。

Method: PPE通过解耦编码3D位置信息，使每个压缩标记能包含多个原始标记的不同位置，支持级联聚类策略。

Result: 在多个视觉语言基准测试中，PPE实现了2%∼5%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 保留位置信息对高效且有效的MLLM推理至关重要。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 测试生物特征统计不相关的传统假设是否成立。

Method: 使用ResNet-50和Vision Transformer架构训练Bi-Encoder网络，进行指纹-指纹、虹膜-虹膜及跨模态指纹-虹膜匹配。

Result: 虹膜匹配的ROC AUC达91%，指纹匹配也显示相关性，但跨模态匹配效果接近随机。

Conclusion: 生物特征存在相关性，未来需扩展研究至其他特征并优化跨模态匹配方法。

Abstract: There has been a historic assumption that the biometrics of an individual are
statistically uncorrelated. We test this assumption by training Bi-Encoder
networks on three verification tasks, including fingerprint-to-fingerprint
matching, iris-to-iris matching, and cross-modal fingerprint-to-iris matching
using 274 subjects with $\sim$100k fingerprints and 7k iris images. We trained
ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer backbones in Bi-Encoder architectures such
that the contrastive loss between images sampled from the same individual is
minimized. The iris ResNet architecture reaches 91 ROC AUC score for
iris-to-iris matching, providing clear evidence that the left and right irises
of an individual are correlated. Fingerprint models reproduce the positive
intra-subject suggested by prior work in this space. This is the first work
attempting to use Vision Transformers for this matching. Cross-modal matching
rises only slightly above chance, which suggests that more data and a more
sophisticated pipeline is needed to obtain compelling results. These findings
continue challenge independence assumptions of biometrics and we plan to extend
this work to other biometrics in the future. Code available:

Motivation: 现有全局码本策略忽略了图像内类别特定相关性和令牌间语义差异，导致低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 学习不同图像类别的码本组，为每个令牌分配独立码本，记录令牌所属码本组以减少损失。

Result: 在0.05 bpp下，重建图像的平均识别准确率达到93.51%。

Conclusion: 该方法可集成到现有码本表示学习中，显著提升低比特率下的人脸图像压缩性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

Result: 仅用35B tokens训练，在GenEval、DPG-Bench、GEditBench和ImgEdit-Bench等基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: 通过释放代码、模型权重和数据集，支持未来多模态统一建模研究。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时容易陷入性别刻板印象，需要一种方法来减少偏见并保持编辑质量。

Method: FAME通过软注入去偏标记生成公平嵌入，并在时间和跨注意力中集成公平调制，增强区域一致性和抑制无关交互。

Result: 在FairVE基准测试中，FAME在公平对齐和语义保真度上优于现有基线。

Conclusion: FAME有效减少了职业相关的性别偏见，同时保持了视频编辑的连贯性和语义准确性。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

### [148] [VALA: Learning Latent Anchors for Training-Free and Temporally Consistent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22970)
*Zhangkai Wu,Xuhui Fan,Zhongyuan Xie,Kaize Shi,Longbing Cao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VALA提出了一种变分对齐模块，通过自适应选择关键帧并压缩其潜在特征为语义锚点，以提升视频编辑的时序一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式帧选择，导致手动偏差和端到端推理的可扩展性降低。

Method: VALA采用变分框架和对比学习目标，将跨帧潜在表示压缩为保留内容和时序一致性的潜在锚点。

Result: 实验表明VALA在反转保真度、编辑质量和时序一致性上达到SOTA，且效率更高。

Conclusion: VALA为无训练视频编辑提供了高效且一致的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有占用数据稀缺问题，推动自动驾驶场景生成技术的发展。

Method: 采用时空解耦架构，结合高斯溅射和传感器感知嵌入技术。

Result: 在生成保真度和扩展性上优于现有方法，验证了下游任务的实际价值。

Conclusion: Nuplan-Occ数据集和统一框架为自动驾驶场景生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Driving scene generation is a critical domain for autonomous driving,
enabling downstream applications, including perception and planning evaluation.
Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

TL;DR: VoMP是一种前馈方法，用于预测3D物体的体积材料属性，通过多视图特征和几何变换器实现高精度和快速预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物理模拟通常依赖于手工制作的空间变化力学属性，费时费力。VoMP旨在自动化这一过程。

Method: VoMP通过多视图特征聚合和几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在代码，并利用真实数据集学习物理合理的材料流形。

Result: 实验表明，VoMP在准确性和速度上远超现有方法。

Conclusion: VoMP为3D物体的体积材料属性预测提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出SceneDecorator框架，解决文本到图像生成中场景一致性和叙事连贯性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在角色一致性上表现良好，但忽略了场景在叙事中的重要性，限制了创造力。

Method: 采用VLM-Guided Scene Planning和Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention，以全局到局部方式确保叙事连贯性和场景一致性。

Result: 实验表明SceneDecorator在艺术、电影和游戏领域具有显著优势。

Conclusion: SceneDecorator为场景导向的故事生成提供了创新解决方案，释放了创造力。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

### [152] [LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995)
*Md Mostafijur Rahman,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LoMix是一种可微分、即插即用的模块，通过混合多尺度解码器logits并优化损失权重，显著提升了U型网络的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有U型网络在多尺度logits训练中未充分利用混合尺度的互补信息，导致性能受限。

Method: 提出LoMix模块，使用四种轻量级融合操作（加法、乘法、拼接和注意力加权）生成混合输出，并优化损失权重。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LoMix显著提升了DICE分数（最高+13.5%），尤其在数据稀缺时优势更大。

Conclusion: LoMix通过可学习的加权混合尺度融合，实现了性能提升、数据高效且无推理开销。

Abstract: U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a
different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats
these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final,
highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss
weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations.
Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only
when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce
LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that
generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should
guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder
logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication,
concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of
synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss
weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step
architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales,
mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures
(i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset
improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep
supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero
inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled
scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency.
Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up
to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted
mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully
interpretable, and overhead-free at inference. Our code is available at
https://github.com/SLDGroup/LoMix.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoMo是一个用于文本到视频生成中组合运动定制的新框架，解决了多主体运动控制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂多主体运动控制上表现不佳，尤其是运动-外观纠缠和多运动混合问题。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：单运动学习阶段解耦运动与外观，多运动组合阶段通过空间隔离策略组合运动。

Result: CoMo在实验中表现优异，显著提升了可控视频生成的能力。

Conclusion: CoMo为组合运动定制提供了有效解决方案，并推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

*Pan Zhao,Hui Yuan,Chongzhen Tian,Tian Guo,Raouf Hamzaoui,Zhigeng Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的几何和属性增强框架（UGAE），显著提升了点云压缩的质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决点云压缩中几何结构和属性信息的不可逆失真问题。

Method: UGAE框架包含三个核心组件：PoGE（基于Transformer的稀疏卷积U-Net）、PAE（几何引导的重新着色策略）和PoAE（属性残差预测网络）。

Result: 在多个数据集上显著优于现有方法，几何和属性的压缩质量均有显著提升。

Conclusion: UGAE框架在点云压缩中表现出色，具有高效性和高质量的特点。

Abstract: Lossy compression of point clouds reduces storage and transmission costs;
however, it inevitably leads to irreversible distortion in geometry structure
and attribute information. To address these issues, we propose a unified
geometry and attribute enhancement (UGAE) framework, which consists of three
core components: post-geometry enhancement (PoGE), pre-attribute enhancement
(PAE), and post-attribute enhancement (PoAE). In PoGE, a Transformer-based
sparse convolutional U-Net is used to reconstruct the geometry structure with
high precision by predicting voxel occupancy probabilities. Building on the
refined geometry structure, PAE introduces an innovative enhanced
geometry-guided recoloring strategy, which uses a detail-aware K-Nearest
Neighbors (DA-KNN) method to achieve accurate recoloring and effectively
preserve high-frequency details before attribute compression. Finally, at the
decoder side, PoAE uses an attribute residual prediction network with a
weighted mean squared error (W-MSE) loss to enhance the quality of
high-frequency regions while maintaining the fidelity of low-frequency regions.
UGAE significantly outperformed existing methods on three benchmark datasets:
8iVFB, Owlii, and MVUB. Compared to the latest G-PCC test model (TMC13v29),
UGAE achieved an average BD-PSNR gain of 9.98 dB and 90.98% BD-bitrate savings
for geometry under the D1 metric, as well as a 3.67 dB BD-PSNR improvement with
56.88% BD-bitrate savings for attributes on the Y component. Additionally, it
improved perceptual quality significantly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在多实例、多类别和多关系的复杂提示下表现不佳，且现有评估指标与人类评价相关性不高。

Method: 提出了M$^3$T2IBench基准和AlignScore评估指标，并设计了训练无关的Revise-Then-Enforce后编辑方法。

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在M$^3$T2IBench上表现不佳，但Revise-Then-Enforce方法能显著提升对齐效果。

Conclusion: M$^3$T2IBench和AlignScore为复杂文本到图像生成提供了更准确的评估工具，Revise-Then-Enforce方法具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型（如VAR）在图像生成中计算量大且样本多样性有限，NestAR旨在解决这些问题。

Method: NestAR采用嵌套自回归架构，通过多尺度模块分层生成图像，并使用流匹配损失和连续令牌优化训练。

Result: NestAR将生成n个图像令牌的复杂度从O(n)降至O(log n)，同时提高了图像多样性。

Conclusion: NestAR在保持竞争力的图像生成性能的同时，显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在长视频中因过度下采样或固定窗口而损失时序保真度，需要一种能兼顾全局上下文和细粒度时序细节的解决方案。

Method: 提出HieraMamba架构，利用AMP块生成多粒度锚点令牌，并通过对比损失保持局部细节和全局区分性。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上达到新SOTA，展示了长视频中精确的时序定位能力。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层设计和对比学习，有效解决了长视频时序定位中的保真度和语义丰富性问题。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

Conclusion: 提出的方法简单有效，能够显著提升深度学习配准方法在训练数据分布外的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning based deformable registration methods have become popular in

registration challenge for Learn2Reg 2025 aims to advance the field by
evaluating the performance of the registration on contrasts and modalities
different from those included in the training set. Here we describe our

Conclusion: 通过位置一致性、全频率利用和文本先验保护，提出的方法在多模态任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一的分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和去除导致未退化区域失真。

Method: 理论推导广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，提出RDBM，利用残差调制噪声注入和去除，实现自适应修复。

Result: RDBM在多种图像修复任务中表现出色，实验验证其最优性。

Conclusion: RDBM为扩散桥模型提供了统一框架，并在性能上达到最优。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态融合中表现出色，提供了模型鲁棒性的新见解。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

TL;DR: DeepSalt是一种基于深度学习的框架，通过知识蒸馏和光谱适应单元，将实验室高分辨率光谱数据迁移到卫星遥感数据，实现大范围土壤盐分精确监测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 土壤盐碱化影响作物生长，传统实验室方法精度高但难以扩展，卫星遥感覆盖广但分辨率不足。

Method: 提出DeepSalt框架，结合知识蒸馏和光谱适应单元，实现实验室与卫星数据间的光谱迁移。

Result: DeepSalt在性能上显著优于无域适应方法，并能泛化到新地理区域。

Conclusion: DeepSalt无需大量地面采样即可实现大范围盐分精确估计，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

TL;DR: 论文通过TLS线拟合视角统一了两种结构张量构造方法，指出Granlund和Knutsson 1995的修正项不必要，并扩展了适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨Bigun和Granlund 1987与Granlund和Knutsson 1995提出的两种结构张量构造方法的异同，寻求统一视角。

Method: 通过Total Least Squares (TLS)线拟合功率谱的视角分析两种方法。

Result: 发现修正项可省略，确保张量半正定；扩展了滤波器类型和频谱划分方式。

Conclusion: 统一视角简化了张量解释，并提供了更灵活的结构张量构造方法。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法中，部分参考点远离目标物体，导致误检。

Method: 使用深度信息和2D检测生成参考点，结合混合注意力机制融合历史检测结果。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mAP提升6.3%，NDS提升4.3%。

Conclusion: DQ3D有效提升3D目标检测性能，减少误检。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Motivation: 现有方法难以准确评估新兴预训练模型的可迁移性，限制了预训练-微调范式的应用。

Method: 提出ITM框架，隐式建模模型内在可迁移性，并采用DVA策略高效近似嵌入空间演化。

Result: 在广泛实验中，ITM在稳定性、有效性和效率上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ITM为预训练模型的可迁移性评估提供了更通用和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在传感器退化或环境干扰的复杂场景中性能显著下降，需要一种更鲁棒的融合方法。

Method: 将多模态特征投影到统一的BEV空间，通过窗口注意力增强，并设计自适应门控融合模块选择性整合特征。

Result: 在KITTI数据集上达到93.92%的准确率，在自建的E3D数据集上比基线提升24.88%。

Conclusion: AG-Fusion在复杂工业场景中表现出对不可靠模态信息的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Result: 能够准确建立复杂场景之间的对应关系，并展示了轨迹和路径点转移的应用。

Conclusion: 该方法在零样本、开放词汇环境下有效，为3D场景类比提供了灵活且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于视频数据量庞大，人工监控难以覆盖，亟需自动化的异常事件检测方法，尤其是基于空间推理的解决方案。

Method: 通过将视频转换为文本描述，并利用文本蕴含评分进行零样本异常检测，评估了四种开源模型在UCF-Crime和RWF-2000数据集上的表现。

Result: 研究发现，当前VLMs在简单、空间显著的事件中表现良好，但在噪声空间线索或身份混淆时表现不佳。隐私保护措施（如全身GAN变换）会降低准确性。

Conclusion: 论文提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间推理的具体方法，如结构感知提示、轻量级空间记忆等，为零样本语言驱动的视频理解提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

TL;DR: DecoDINO是一种基于DECO框架的三分支网络，用于改进人与物体接触预测，在DAMON基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DECO在软表面、遮挡、儿童和误报足部接触等问题上的局限性。

Method: 使用两个DINOv2 ViT-g/14编码器、类平衡损失权重和补丁级交叉注意力，最后通过轻量级MLP分配语义接触标签。

Result: 在DAMON基准测试中，F1分数提高7%，地理误差减半，并增加了对象级语义标签。

Conclusion: DecoDINO在DAMON挑战中表现优于基线，LoRA微调和双编码器是关键改进因素。

Abstract: Accurate vertex-level contact prediction between humans and surrounding
objects is a prerequisite for high fidelity human object interaction models
used in robotics, AR/VR, and behavioral simulation. DECO was the first in the
wild estimator for this task but is limited to binary contact maps and
struggles with soft surfaces, occlusions, children, and false-positive foot
contacts. We address these issues and introduce DecoDINO, a three-branch
network based on DECO's framework. It uses two DINOv2 ViT-g/14 encoders,
class-balanced loss weighting to reduce bias, and patch-level cross-attention
for improved local reasoning. Vertex features are finally passed through a
lightweight MLP with a softmax to assign semantic contact labels. We also
tested a vision-language model (VLM) to integrate text features, but the
simpler architecture performed better and was used instead. On the DAMON
benchmark, DecoDINO (i) raises the binary-contact F1 score by 7$\%$, (ii)
halves the geodesic error, and (iii) augments predictions with object-level
semantic labels. Ablation studies show that LoRA fine-tuning and the dual
encoders are key to these improvements. DecoDINO outperformed the challenge
baseline in both tasks of the DAMON Challenge. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现实世界中，自动驾驶系统需要应对不同车辆配置导致的视角变化，现有方法在视角泛化上表现不足。

Method: 提出VR-Drive框架，结合3D场景重建和视角混合记忆库，支持在线训练增强和视角一致性蒸馏。

Result: VR-Drive有效减少合成噪声，提升视角变化下的规划性能，并发布新数据集用于评估。

Conclusion: VR-Drive为端到端自动驾驶系统提供了一种可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

Motivation: 解决全幻灯片图像（WSIs）检索的挑战，如超大尺寸和语义差异捕捉困难，以支持精确诊断和病理教育。

Method: 结合细粒度注意力马赛克表示和全局幻灯片嵌入，通过视觉语言对比学习训练6,926对幻灯片-报告数据。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中表现优于传统检索框架，提升诊断准确性、信心和观察者间一致性。

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理学检索解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

Method: 收集并分析了12,832个视频数据集，使用15种顶级检测器进行实验，并引入合成Moiré生成技术。

Result: Moiré伪影使检测性能下降高达25.4%，而合成Moiré模式导致准确率下降21.4%。

Conclusion: 需要开发能鲁棒处理Moiré伪影的检测模型，DMF数据集旨在缩小实验与实际检测之间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Motivation: 现有自回归Transformer方法在HTG中虽能实现风格保真和泛化，但需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制且易产生重复循环和视觉伪影。

Method: 将HTG重新定义为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入标记以增强视觉对齐，并设计基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Conclusion: Eruku方法在HTG任务中显著优于现有解决方案，实现了更高的内容控制和生成质量。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

Motivation: 解决传统固定尺寸图像块采样在3D医学图像分割中存在的类别不平衡和收敛速度慢的问题。

Method: 通过渐进式增大训练过程中的图像块尺寸，设计了资源高效模式（减少训练时间）和性能模式（提升分割性能）。

Result: 资源高效模式将训练时间减少至44%，性能模式在15个任务中均超越基线，平均Dice分数提升1.28%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，适用于多种分割模型，显著提升了性能和训练效率。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于YOLO模型的端到端分层图像检测与分类方法，通过改进损失函数和性能指标，解决了传统平面分类忽略对象层次结构的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的对象通常具有层次结构，传统CNN分类方法仅关注平面分类，忽略了这种层次关系，影响了分类效果和错误控制。

Method: 基于YOLO模型家族，提出了一种新的分层架构、改进的损失函数和分层性能指标，并在两种不同层次分类的数据集上进行了训练和评估。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法能够有效捕捉对象的层次结构，优于传统平面分类算法。

Conclusion: 分层模型能够更好地处理现实世界对象的层次关系，为图像分类任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

TL;DR: AdaSDE是一种新型单步SDE求解器，结合ODE的高效性和SDE的误差鲁棒性，通过动态调节误差校正强度加速扩散采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ODE和SDE求解器在计算速度和样本质量上各有不足：ODE沿确定性轨迹积累不可约梯度误差，SDE在步数有限时离散化误差放大。

Method: 引入AdaSDE，通过轻量级蒸馏估计每步可学习系数，动态调节误差校正强度。

Result: 在5 NFE下，AdaSDE在CIFAR-10、FFHQ和LSUN Bedroom上分别达到4.18、8.05和6.96的FID分数。

Conclusion: AdaSDE统一了ODE和SDE的优势，显著提升了扩散采样的效率和性能。

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

<details>

Motivation: 现有讽刺检测方法主要关注单图像场景，忽略了多图像间的语义和情感关系，无法真实反映现实场景中的多图像讽刺触发。

Method: 提出跨图像推理模型CIRM，通过跨图像序列建模捕捉潜在关联，并引入基于文本-图像对应关系的细粒度跨模态融合机制。

Result: MMSD3.0成为有效可靠的新基准，CIRM在单图像和多图像场景中均表现最佳。

Conclusion: CIRM在多图像讽刺检测中表现优异，验证了其跨图像建模的有效性，MMSD3.0填补了现实场景的建模空白。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

TL;DR: MDReID是一个灵活的任意模态图像级ReID框架，适用于模态匹配和不匹配场景，通过分解模态特征为共享和特定部分提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中ReID系统因模态不一致（如RGB、NIR、TIR）导致的性能限制问题。

Method: 提出MDReID框架，包含模态解耦学习（MDL）和模态感知度量学习（MML），分解模态特征并增强跨模态判别能力。

Result: 在三个多模态ReID基准测试中显著提升性能，模态匹配场景下mAP提升9.8%、3.0%、11.5%，不匹配场景下平均提升3.4%、11.8%、10.9%。

Conclusion: MDReID通过模态特征分解和优化度量学习，有效提升了跨模态ReID的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

TL;DR: ReconViaGen通过将重建先验整合到生成框架中，解决了多视角3D重建中因遮挡和稀疏覆盖导致的不完整性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖输入视角的重叠，但实际中遮挡和稀疏覆盖会导致重建不完整，扩散生成技术虽能补全不可见部分，但受限于随机性和一致性不足。

Method: 提出ReconViaGen，整合重建先验，改进多视角特征提取和局部细节生成的可控性。

Result: 实验表明，ReconViaGen能重建全局结构和局部细节均与输入一致的完整3D模型。

Conclusion: ReconViaGen有效解决了扩散生成方法的一致性问题，提升了3D重建的完整性和准确性。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: This thesis works to address a pivotal challenge in medical image analysis:
the reliance on extensive labeled datasets, which are often limited due to the
need for expert annotation and constrained by privacy and legal issues. By
focusing on the development of self-supervised learning techniques and domain
adaptation methods, this research aims to circumvent these limitations,
presenting a novel approach to enhance the utility and efficacy of deep
learning in medical imaging.
  Central to this thesis is the development of the Medformer, an innovative
neural network architecture designed for multitask learning and deep domain
adaptation. This model is adept at pre-training on diverse medical image
datasets, handling varying sizes and modalities, and is equipped with a dynamic
input-output adaptation mechanism. This enables efficient processing and
integration of a wide range of medical image types, from 2D X-rays to complex
3D MRIs, thus mitigating the dependency on large labeled datasets.
  Further, the thesis explores the current state of self-supervised learning in
medical imaging. It introduces novel pretext tasks that are capable of
extracting meaningful information from unlabeled data, significantly advancing
the model's interpretative abilities. This approach is validated through
rigorous experimentation, including the use of the MedMNIST dataset,
demonstrating the model's proficiency in learning generalized features
applicable to various downstream tasks.
  In summary, this thesis contributes to the advancement of medical image
analysis by offering a scalable, adaptable framework that reduces reliance on
labeled data. It paves the way for more accurate, efficient diagnostic tools in
healthcare, signifying a major step forward in the application of deep learning
in medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical
evaluation, where scalable, objective readouts can accelerate decision-making.
We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast
microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that
challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation
pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image
label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance
model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for
future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and
extension.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarTrack是一个大规模、高质量且具有挑战性的平面跟踪基准数据集，包含1150个序列和733K帧，用于评估短期和长期跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模平台，平面跟踪在深度学习时代的发展受限，PlanarTrack旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过记录野外无约束条件下的视频，手动标注每帧的四个角点，并确保每个序列中仅包含一个独特目标。

Result: 评估显示，现有平面跟踪器在PlanarTrack上表现显著下降，表明需要更多改进努力。

Conclusion: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化且最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，为未来研究提供了基准。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

Motivation: 解决扩散模型在RSSR中训练成本高、推理速度慢的问题，并充分利用辅助信息以提高图像的科学真实性。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion，整合跨模态注意力、辅助知识（如DEM、土地覆盖、月份）和SAR引导，使用适配器和傅里叶NDVI损失优化空间细节和光谱保真度。

Result: 在RGB和IR波段上达到PSNR/SSIM为32.63/0.84和23.99/0.78，NDVI MSE最低（0.042），推理速度快（0.39秒/图像），并在下游任务（如作物分类）中表现优异（F1: 0.86）。

Conclusion: LSSR框架展示了RSSR在精准农业中的潜力，为遥感图像超分辨率提供了高效且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

Motivation: 视频时间定位（VTG）任务中，部分标注样本和难样本会导致模糊监督和学习效率低下，现有方法未充分解决这些问题。

Method: 提出Boundary Reflection Agent和Difficulty Estimation Agent，分别用于识别部分标注样本和动态调整难样本的训练策略。

Result: 实验表明，仅用10%的训练数据和21%的计算预算，VideoTG-R1在GRPO和SFT下均优于全数据方法。

Conclusion: VideoTG-R1通过数据高效训练策略，显著提升了VTG任务的性能，为视频理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding (VTG) aims to locate precise segments in videos
based on language queries, which is a fundamental challenge in video
understanding. While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown
promise in tackling VTG through reinforcement learning (RL), they overlook the
challenges arising from both the quality and difficulty of training samples.
(1) Partially annotated samples. Many samples contain relevant segments beyond
the annotated interval, introducing ambiguous supervision. (2) Hard-to-ground
samples. Samples with poor zero-shot performance produce consistently low and
indistinguishable rewards during RL training, exhibiting no clear preference
among multiple outputs and thus hindering learning efficiency. To address these
challenges, we propose VideoTG-R1, a novel curriculum RL framework with
reflected boundary annotations, enabling data-efficient training. Specifically,
we propose a Boundary Reflection Agent that utilizes MLLMs to predict
query-relevant timestamps outside the annotated intervals, allowing us to
identify and filter out partially annotated samples, thereby reducing
ambiguity. Furthermore, we introduce a Difficulty Estimation Agent to assess
the training difficulty of each sample and design a curriculum RL strategy that
dynamically masks the videos of hard-to-ground samples according to the
training steps, easing the training difficulty and providing clearer
preference. Experiments on the VTG and grounded VideoQA tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. Remarkably, with only 10% of the training samples
and 21% of the computational budget, VideoTG-R1 outperforms full-data
counterparts under both group relative policy optimization (GRPO) and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). The code is available at

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多平面截面的CAD逆向工程新方法，有效捕捉细节并整合草图约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在CAD逆向工程中难以兼顾参数化输出和几何细节，且忽略草图约束。

Method: 利用多平面截面提取2D模式，模拟人类设计师手动操作，直接整合草图约束。

Result: 方法优于现有技术，首次在重建过程中直接包含草图约束。

Conclusion: 新方法显著提升了CAD逆向工程的精度和可编辑性。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

TL;DR: CURVETE是一种新型深度学习模型，通过课程学习和自监督训练解决医学图像分析中样本不足和类别分布不均的问题，并在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分析中高质量标注样本稀缺且分布不均，传统迁移学习方法效果有限。

Method: 提出CURVETE模型，结合课程学习和渐进自监督训练，优化样本分解和类别分布。

Result: 在脑肿瘤、膝关节X光和Mini-DDSM数据集上，CURVETE分别达到96.60%、75.60%和93.35%的准确率。

Conclusion: CURVETE显著提升分类性能，适用于医学图像分析中的样本限制问题。

Abstract: Identifying high-quality and easily accessible annotated samples poses a
notable challenge in medical image analysis. Transfer learning techniques,
leveraging pre-training data, offer a flexible solution to this issue. However,
the impact of fine-tuning diminishes when the dataset exhibits an irregular
distribution between classes. This paper introduces a novel deep convolutional
neural network, named Curriculum Learning and Progressive Self-supervised
Training (CURVETE). CURVETE addresses challenges related to limited samples,
enhances model generalisability, and improves overall classification
performance. It achieves this by employing a curriculum learning strategy based
on the granularity of sample decomposition during the training of generic
unlabelled samples. Moreover, CURVETE address the challenge of irregular class
distribution by incorporating a class decomposition approach in the downstream
task. The proposed method undergoes evaluation on three distinct medical image
datasets: brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM datasets. We
investigate the classification performance using a generic self-supervised
sample decomposition approach with and without the curriculum learning
component in training the pretext task. Experimental results demonstrate that
the CURVETE model achieves superior performance on test sets with an accuracy
of 96.60% on the brain tumour dataset, 75.60% on the digital knee x-ray
dataset, and 93.35% on the Mini-DDSM dataset using the baseline ResNet-50.
Furthermore, with the baseline DenseNet-121, it achieved accuracies of 95.77%,
80.36%, and 93.22% on the brain tumour, digital knee x-ray, and Mini-DDSM
datasets, respectively, outperforming other training strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为FRBNet的频率域径向基网络，通过频率域通道比提取光照不变特征，显著提升了低光条件下下游任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光视觉因光照退化严重影响检测和分割等下游任务性能，现有方法因对低光条件建模不完整而表现不佳。

Method: 扩展经典Lambertian模型，在频率域分析中利用通道比提取光照不变特征，提出可端到端训练的FRBNet模块。

Result: FRBNet在多个下游任务中表现优异，如暗光物体检测提升2.2 mAP，夜间分割提升2.9 mIoU。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块，无需修改损失函数即可集成到现有网络中，显著提升低光任务性能。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Motivation: 现有图像推理方法在MLLMs中表现优异，但动态推理范式尚未应用于视频推理任务。

Method: 提出Video-Thinker，构建Video-Thinker-10K数据集，采用SFT和GRPO训练策略。

Result: 在多个视频推理基准测试中表现优异，Video-Thinker-7B超越现有基线。

Conclusion: Video-Thinker为MLLMs的视频推理提供了高效自主的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据集通常局限于单一交叉路口或单一车辆，缺乏多样性，导致算法在多样化交通环境中的性能评估受限。

Method: 数据集包含34个时间对齐和空间校准的传感器序列，涵盖12个车载RGB摄像头、2个车载LiDAR、17个基础设施热成像摄像头和12个基础设施LiDAR。

Result: 数据集提供了712k个标注实例，覆盖13个对象类别，并提供了最先进的协同感知方法的评估。

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X填补了协同感知数据集的空白，为多样化交通环境中的算法评估提供了支持。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

TL;DR: MergeMix是一种结合监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL）的训练增强范式，通过注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练，提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的效率和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法SFT需要大量人工标注且无法捕捉细微偏好，RL则存在开销和不稳定性问题。MergeMix旨在平衡可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量。

Method: MergeMix通过注意力感知的图像混合（token merge）和偏好对训练（SimPO损失）来优化MLLMs。

Result: 实验表明MergeMix在分类任务中超越其他启发式方法，实现了高效且竞争性的准确率。

Conclusion: MergeMix为MLLMs的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展的解决方案，兼顾效率和性能。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的MCoT学习策略SCCM，以解决当前视觉-语言模型中视觉信息不忠实的问题，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉-语言模型（LVLMs）生成的视觉-文本多模态思维链（MCoT）中，视觉信息常不准确但答案正确，表明推理过程缺乏忠实性。作者认为这是由于强化微调（RFT）中的奖励机制仅鼓励视觉-文本线索的格式，而忽略了视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 论文首先通过干预视觉和文本思维来探测MCoT的忠实性，发现视觉证据常被忽略。接着提出了一种自动化评估指标，从可靠性和充分性两个角度量化视觉线索的忠实性。为解决这一问题，作者提出了SCCM学习策略，鼓励生成足够且最小的视觉组件。

Result: 实验结果表明，SCCM在多个细粒度感知和推理基准测试中显著提高了视觉忠实性。

Conclusion: SCCM是一种无需标注且兼容多种RFT的插拔式方法，能有效提升MCoT的视觉忠实性。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在体积视频重光照中存在时间不稳定性和生产适用性问题，扩散方法在单帧表现良好但序列中噪声大，视频扩散模型受限于内存和规模。

Method: 结合扩散先验与时间正则化，通过光流引导的聚合实现时间一致性，并利用高斯不透明度场提取网格代理进行物理渲染。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在序列重光照中比纯扩散基线更稳定，且能处理更长的视频片段。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合学习先验与物理约束，是实现生产级体积视频重光照的实用方案。

Abstract: Volumetric video relighting is essential for bringing captured performances
into virtual worlds, but current approaches struggle to deliver temporally
stable, production-ready results. Diffusion-based intrinsic decomposition
methods show promise for single frames, yet suffer from stochastic noise and
instability when extended to sequences, while video diffusion models remain
constrained by memory and scale. We propose a hybrid relighting framework that
combines diffusion-derived material priors with temporal regularization and
physically motivated rendering. Our method aggregates multiple stochastic
estimates of per-frame material properties into temporally consistent shading
components, using optical-flow-guided regularization. For indirect effects such
as shadows and reflections, we extract a mesh proxy from Gaussian Opacity
Fields and render it within a standard graphics pipeline. Experiments on real
and synthetic captures show that this hybrid strategy achieves substantially
more stable relighting across sequences than diffusion-only baselines, while
scaling beyond the clip lengths feasible for video diffusion. These results
indicate that hybrid approaches, which balance learned priors with physically
grounded constraints, are a practical step toward production-ready volumetric
video relighting.

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于基线模型，并超越现有技术。

Conclusion: 冷启动对齐对策略蒸馏至关重要，VOLD框架有效提升了视觉语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

Abstract: Graph neural networks have emerged as a promising paradigm for image

classification by recognizing the importance of underlying structure and
relationships in medical image classification. iPac integrates various stages,
including patch partitioning, feature extraction, clustering, graph
construction, and graph-based learning, into a unified network to advance graph
neural network image classification. By capturing relevant features and
organising them into clusters, we construct a meaningful graph representation
that effectively encapsulates the semantics of the image. Experimental
evaluation on diverse medical image datasets demonstrates the efficacy of iPac,
exhibiting an average accuracy improvement of up to 5% over baseline methods.
Our approach offers a versatile and generic solution for image classification,
particularly in the realm of medical images, by leveraging the graph

Method: 利用交叉注意力层权重自动生成动态主体掩码，直接应用于LoRA输出。

Result: 实验表明FreeFuse在生成质量和实用性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: FreeFuse无需额外训练或辅助模型，高效且实用。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Motivation: 现有MLLMs在可见事件推理上表现优异，但缺乏对自我中心视角的隐含意图和细粒度交互的理解能力。

Method: 构建大规模自我中心问答数据集EgoRe-5M，并通过监督微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT）两阶段学习提升模型能力。

Result: EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中表现优于现有方法，尤其在细粒度时空定位任务上有显著提升。

Conclusion: EgoThinker成功填补了MLLMs在自我中心推理上的能力缺口，为相关研究提供了新工具和数据支持。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

Motivation: 预训练文本到图像扩散模型在零样本深度估计中表现出色，但训练过程中的参数更新会损害其图像生成能力。MERGE旨在解决这一问题，扩展模型功能而不损失原有能力。

Method: MERGE采用可插拔转换器实现图像生成与深度估计模式的切换，并提出组重用机制以提高参数利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时保留了图像生成能力。

Conclusion: MERGE展示了预训练文本到图像模型的多功能性，为统一模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degra- dation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play-
and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and
depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we
propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and im- prove the
utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the
powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of- the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The

TL;DR: 提出Lookahead Anchoring方法，通过未来关键帧引导音频驱动的人体动画生成，解决身份漂移问题，提升同步性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的人体动画在自回归生成中容易出现身份漂移，现有方法依赖额外关键帧生成，限制了运动动态。

Method: 利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性引导，而非固定边界，实现持续身份保持，并支持自关键帧化。

Result: 在三种人体动画模型中，该方法显著提升了唇同步、身份保持和视觉质量。

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring通过未来关键帧引导，有效平衡表达自由与身份一致性，适用于多种架构。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

TL;DR: FARMER是一个结合归一化流和自回归模型的生成框架，用于高效图像合成和似然估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续自回归模型在视觉像素数据上因序列过长和高维空间导致的效率问题。

Method: 使用可逆自回归流将图像转换为潜在序列，并通过自监督降维和一步蒸馏加速推理。

Result: FARMER在图像生成质量和似然估计上表现优异，且训练可扩展。

Conclusion: FARMER在像素级生成模型中具有竞争力，同时提供精确似然和高效训练。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏动态内参标注和场景多样性，限制了3D算法的准确性。

Method: 构建校准实验查找表并改进Kalibr工具箱，确保每帧内参准确性。

Result: InFlux包含143K+标注帧，评估显示现有方法在动态内参预测上表现不佳。

Conclusion: InFlux填补了动态内参基准测试的空白，为未来研究提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM-Bench是一个基于视觉谜题的基准测试，用于评估模型在推理过程中的逻辑一致性和错误检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估仅关注最终答案准确性，无法反映模型推理的真实能力，PRISM-Bench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过提供包含一个错误的逐步推理链（CoT），要求模型识别第一个错误步骤，从而评估多模态推理能力。

Result: 实验显示，即使生成流畅推理链的先进MLLMs，也难以准确定位简单逻辑错误。

Conclusion: PRISM-Bench为多模态推理能力提供了更精细的评估工具，并强调诊断性评估在开发可信MLLMs中的重要性。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{PRISM-Bench}, a benchmark of puzzle-based visual
challenges designed to evaluate not only whether models can solve problems, but
how their reasoning unfolds. Unlike prior evaluations that measure only
final-answer accuracy, PRISM-Bench introduces a diagnostic task: given a visual
puzzle and a step-by-step chain-of-thought (CoT) containing exactly one error,
models must identify the first incorrect step. This setting enables
fine-grained assessment of logical consistency, error detection, and visual
reasoning. The puzzles in PRISM-Bench require multi-step symbolic, geometric,
and analogical reasoning, resisting shortcuts based on superficial pattern
matching. Evaluations across state-of-the-art MLLMs reveal a persistent gap
between fluent generation and faithful reasoning: models that produce plausible
CoTs often fail to locate simple logical faults. By disentangling answer
generation from reasoning verification, PRISM-Bench offers a sharper lens on
multimodal reasoning competence and underscores the need for diagnostic
evaluation protocols in the development of trustworthy MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有MLLM主要关注整体场景理解，忽略了细粒度的对象中心推理需求。

Method: 提出Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer（SAOT）生成对象表示，并设计PixelRefer-Lite通过Object-Centric Infusion模块预融合全局上下文。

Result: PixelRefer在多个基准测试中表现领先，PixelRefer-Lite在保持高语义保真度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: PixelRefer框架在细粒度视觉理解任务中表现出色，同时高效变体PixelRefer-Lite在计算效率上有显著优势。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

Conclusion: Concerto生成的空间表征具有几何和语义一致性，适用于开放世界感知。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器人搅拌和轨迹优化的方法，用于解决害虫计数中的遮挡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图像的害虫计数方法难以处理遮挡情况，需要更准确的监测方法。

Method: 开发了自动搅拌系统，研究了不同搅拌轨迹的影响，并设计了基于计数置信度的闭环控制系统。

Result: 通过实验确定了最优搅拌轨迹，并实现了自适应速度控制。

Conclusion: 该方法首次研究了动态液体环境中搅拌轨迹对计数的影响，并实现了自适应速度搅拌。

Abstract: Accurate monitoring of pest population dynamics is crucial for informed
decision-making in precision agriculture. Currently, mainstream image-based
pest counting methods primarily rely on image processing combined with machine
learning or deep learning for pest counting. However, these methods have
limitations and struggle to handle situations involving pest occlusion. To
address this issue, this paper proposed a robotic stirring method with
trajectory optimization and adaptive speed control for accurate pest counting
in water traps. First, we developed an automated stirring system for pest
counting in yellow water traps based on a robotic arm. Stirring alters the
distribution of pests in the yellow water trap, making some of the occluded
individuals visible for detection and counting. Then, we investigated the
impact of different stirring trajectories on pest counting performance and
selected the optimal trajectory for pest counting. Specifically, we designed
six representative stirring trajectories, including circle, square, triangle,
spiral, four small circles, and random lines, for the robotic arm to stir. And
by comparing the overall average counting error and counting confidence of
different stirring trajectories across various pest density scenarios, we
determined the optimal trajectory. Finally, we proposed a counting
confidence-driven closed-loop control system to achieve adaptive-speed
stirring. It uses changes in pest counting confidence between consecutive
frames as feedback to adjust the stirring speed. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first study dedicated to investigating the effects of different
stirring trajectories on object counting in the dynamic liquid environment and
to implement adaptive-speed stirring for this type of task. Experimental
results show ...

Motivation: 当前LAAC手术依赖手动导管控制和辐射成像，存在辐射暴露和定位精度不足的问题，需要更安全、精确的替代方法。

Method: 使用集成FBGs的力传感导管和电磁跟踪技术，在解剖模型中进行机器人辅助LAAC，实时测量力和导管位置。

Result: 力-位移分析揭示了低幅度的相互作用力，表明对周围组织的机械应力较小，为临床医生提供了更好的术中反馈。

Conclusion: 该方法有望提高LAAC手术的安全性和精确性，未来将自动化步骤分类并在动态环境中验证。

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) increases the risk of thromboembolic events due to
impaired function of the left atrial appendage (LAA). Left atrial appendage
closure (LAAC) is a minimally invasive intervention designed to reduce stroke
risk by sealing the LAA with an expandable occluder device. Current deployment
relies on manual catheter control and imaging modalities like fluoroscopy and
transesophageal echocardiography, which carry limitations including radiation
exposure and limited positioning precision. In this study, we leverage a
previously developed force-sensing delivery sheath integrating fiber Bragg
gratings (FBGs) at the interface between the catheter and the occluder.
Combined with electromagnetic (EM) tracking, this setup enables real-time
measurement of interaction forces and catheter tip position during
robot-assisted LAAC deployment in an anatomical phantom. We present a novel
force-displacement profiling method that characterizes occluder deployment
dynamics and identifies key procedural steps without relying on ionizing
radiation. The force profiles reveal low-magnitude interaction forces,
suggesting minimal mechanical stress on the surrounding anatomy. This approach
shows promise in providing clinicians with enhanced intraoperative feedback,
improving deployment outcome. Future work will focus on automating deployment
steps classification and validating the sensing strategy in dynamic, realistic
environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对电动汽车的相位感知AI（PAAI）跟车模型，显著提高了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微观模型未能准确描述电动汽车独特的跟车动力学，而电动汽车在交通中的占比不断增加，亟需开发易用且准确的模型。

Method: 结合传统物理框架与AI组件，识别并适应不同驾驶阶段（如快速加速和再生制动），利用真实轨迹数据进行模拟验证。

Result: PAAI模型在预测准确性上显著优于传统跟车模型。

Conclusion: PAAI模型为交通模拟中准确描述电动汽车行为提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles and electric vehicles (EVs) exhibit
distinct vehicle dynamics. EVs provide rapid acceleration, with electric motors
producing peak power across a wider speed range, and achieve swift deceleration
through regenerative braking. While existing microscopic models effectively
capture the driving behavior of ICE vehicles, a modeling framework that
accurately describes the unique car-following dynamics of EVs is lacking.
Developing such a model is essential given the increasing presence of EVs in
traffic, yet creating an easy-to-use and accurate analytical model remains
challenging.
  To address these gaps, this study develops and validates a Phase-Aware AI
(PAAI) car-following model specifically for EVs. The proposed model enhances
traditional physics-based frameworks with an AI component that recognizes and
adapts to different driving phases, such as rapid acceleration and regenerative
braking. Using real-world trajectory data from vehicles equipped with adaptive
cruise control (ACC), we conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the
model's performance. The numerical results demonstrate that the PAAI model
significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional car-following
models, providing an effective tool for accurately representing EV behavior in
traffic simulations.

Motivation: 现有自动驾驶车辆控制策略忽视与人类驾驶车辆的互动，导致交通拥堵和效率低下。

Method: 结合LSTM和物理约束，设计社会合规的AV控制框架，通过SVO平衡个体与整体交通流目标。

Result: AV控制模式切换时，跟随车队的能耗增加58.99%，平均速度提升38.39%，显著改善交通动态。

Conclusion: 该框架有效提升交通效率，减少拥堵和能耗，为智能交通系统提供新思路。

Abstract: This study introduces a novel control framework for adaptive cruise control
(ACC) in automated driving, leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
and physics-informed constraints. As automated vehicles (AVs) adopt advanced
features like ACC, transportation systems are becoming increasingly intelligent
and efficient. However, existing AV control strategies primarily focus on
optimizing the performance of individual vehicles or platoons, often neglecting
their interactions with human-driven vehicles (HVs) and the broader impact on
traffic flow. This oversight can exacerbate congestion and reduce overall
system efficiency. To address this critical research gap, we propose a neural
network-based, socially compliant AV control framework that incorporates social
value orientation (SVO). This framework enables AVs to account for their
influence on HVs and traffic dynamics. By leveraging AVs as mobile traffic
regulators, the proposed approach promotes adaptive driving behaviors that
reduce congestion, improve traffic efficiency, and lower energy consumption.
Within this framework, we define utility functions for both AVs and HVs, which
are optimized based on the SVO of each AV to balance its own control objectives
with broader traffic flow considerations. Numerical results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed method in adapting to varying traffic conditions,
thereby enhancing system-wide efficiency. Specifically, when the AV's control
mode shifts from prioritizing energy consumption to optimizing traffic flow
efficiency, vehicles in the following platoon experience at least a 58.99%
increase in individual energy consumption alongside at least a 38.39%
improvement in individual average speed, indicating significant enhancements in
traffic dynamics.

Conclusion: NeLV系统为LLM在无人机领域的应用提供了全面框架，并指出了未来研究的技术挑战和发展方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), their
capabilities in various automation domains, particularly Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV) operations, have garnered increasing attention. Current research
remains predominantly constrained to small-scale UAV applications, with most
studies focusing on isolated components such as path planning for toy drones,
while lacking comprehensive investigation of medium- and long-range UAV systems
in real-world operational contexts. Larger UAV platforms introduce distinct
challenges, including stringent requirements for airport-based take-off and
landing procedures, adherence to complex regulatory frameworks, and specialized
operational capabilities with elevated mission expectations. This position
paper presents the Next-Generation LLM for UAV (NeLV) system -- a comprehensive
demonstration and automation roadmap for integrating LLMs into multi-scale UAV
operations. The NeLV system processes natural language instructions to
orchestrate short-, medium-, and long-range UAV missions through five key
technical components: (i) LLM-as-Parser for instruction interpretation, (ii)
Route Planner for Points of Interest (POI) determination, (iii) Path Planner
for waypoint generation, (iv) Control Platform for executable trajectory
implementation, and (v) UAV monitoring. We demonstrate the system's feasibility
through three representative use cases spanning different operational scales:
multi-UAV patrol, multi-POI delivery, and multi-hop relocation. Beyond the
current implementation, we establish a five-level automation taxonomy that
charts the evolution from current LLM-as-Parser capabilities (Level 1) to fully
autonomous LLM-as-Autopilot systems (Level 5), identifying technical
prerequisites and research challenges at each stage.

Motivation: 长时程机器人操作任务中，VLA策略因漂移和暴露偏差导致几何误差累积，缺乏动态计算资源分配机制。

Method: 提出FORGE-Tree，结合扩散强制头和蒙特卡洛树扩散，通过局部编辑和树状去噪优化轨迹。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，FORGE-Tree比基线VLA策略成功率提升13.4至17.2个百分点。

Conclusion: FORGE-Tree显著提升了长时程任务的性能，且计算资源分配灵活。

Abstract: Long-horizon robot manipulation tasks remain challenging for
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies due to drift and exposure bias, often
denoise the entire trajectory with fixed hyperparameters, causing small
geometric errors to compound across stages and offering no mechanism to
allocate extra test-time compute where clearances are tight. To address these
challenges, we introduce FORGE-Tree, a plug-in control layer that couples a
stage-aligned Diffusion Forcing (DF) head with test-time Monte Carlo Tree
Diffusion (MCTD). With a frozen VLA encoder, DF aligns timesteps to subtask
stages; during inference we partially denoise only a target segment while
keeping other tokens frozen, turning trajectory refinement into a sequence of
local edits. We then apply Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion to select the next
segment to refine. A scene graph supplies priors for expansion and geometry
relation-aware scoring for rollouts, yielding tree-structured denoising whose
performance scales with search budget while preserving the executed prefix.
Evaluation on LIBERO, FORGE-Tree improves success rate by 13.4 to 17.2 pp over
the native VLA baselines with both OpenVLA and Octo-Base. Gains remain
consistent under comparable compute budgets, especially on long-horizon
variants. Videos available at: https://taco-group.github.io/FORGE-Tree/

Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要基于2D视觉输入和任务特定动作策略训练，Avi旨在通过3D点云和语言场景理解实现更通用的行为。

Method: Avi利用3D多模态大语言模型生成下一帧点云，并通过经典几何变换计算动作，避免动作标记训练。

Result: Avi对遮挡、相机姿态变化和视角变化具有鲁棒性，能桥接高层语言指令与低层执行。

Conclusion: 3D视觉-语言推理为可扩展、鲁棒的机器人系统提供了新基础。

Abstract: We propose Avi, a novel 3D Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architecture that
reframes robotic action generation as a problem of 3D perception and spatial
reasoning, rather than low-level policy learning. While existing VLA models
primarily operate on 2D visual inputs and are trained end-to-end on
task-specific action policies, Avi leverages 3D point clouds and
language-grounded scene understanding to compute actions through classical
geometric transformations. Most notably, Avi does not train on previous action
tokens, rather, we build upon a 3D Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
generate the next point cloud and explicitly calculate the actions through
classical transformations. This approach enables generalizable behaviors that
are robust to occlusions, camera pose variations, and changes in viewpoint. By
treating the robotic decision-making process as a structured reasoning task
over 3D representations, Avi bridges the gap between high-level language
instructions and low-level actuation without requiring opaque policy learning.
Our preliminary results highlight the potential of 3D vision-language reasoning
as a foundation for scalable, robust robotic systems. Check it out at

contribution of this work is the formulation of speed bump handling constraints

broader road navigation requirements. Through extensive simulations in varied
urban driving environments, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach,
highlighting its ability to ensure smooth speed transitions over speed bumps
while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-time deployment.

Conclusion: 丰富的上下文敏感属性注释对提升动态环境中的机器人感知至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce J-ORA, a novel multimodal dataset that bridges the gap in robot
perception by providing detailed object attribute annotations within Japanese
human-robot dialogue scenarios. J-ORA is designed to support three critical
perception tasks, object identification, reference resolution, and next-action
prediction, by leveraging a comprehensive template of attributes (e.g.,
category, color, shape, size, material, and spatial relations). Extensive
evaluations with both proprietary and open-source Vision Language Models (VLMs)
reveal that incorporating detailed object attributes substantially improves
multimodal perception performance compared to without object attributes.
Despite the improvement, we find that there still exists a gap between
proprietary and open-source VLMs. In addition, our analysis of object
affordances demonstrates varying abilities in understanding object
functionality and contextual relationships across different VLMs. These
findings underscore the importance of rich, context-sensitive attribute
annotations in advancing robot perception in dynamic environments. See project

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种低成本机器人手臂，通过模仿学习实现辅助任务，性能优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 到2050年，全球辅助护理需求将远超人力供给，现有机器人方案昂贵且技术门槛高。

Method: 使用模仿学习从演示视频中学习任务，无需编程或标注；采用PACT和TE方法优化动作。

Result: 系统在真实测试中任务准确率超过90%，模型大小减少5倍仍保持75%准确率。

Conclusion: 未来将探索双手操作和移动性以扩展辅助能力。

Abstract: By 2050, the global demand for assistive care is expected to reach 3.5
billion people, far outpacing the availability of human caregivers. Existing
robotic solutions remain expensive and require technical expertise, limiting
accessibility. This work introduces a low-cost robotic arm for assistive tasks
such as feeding, cleaning spills, and fetching medicine. The system uses
imitation learning from demonstration videos, requiring no task-specific
programming or manual labeling. The robot consists of six servo motors, dual
cameras, and 3D-printed grippers. Data collection via teleoperation with a
leader arm yielded 50,000 video frames across the three tasks. A novel Phased
Action Chunking Transformer (PACT) captures temporal dependencies and segments
motion dynamics, while a Temporal Ensemble (TE) method refines trajectories to
improve accuracy and smoothness. Evaluated across five model sizes and four
architectures, with ten hours of real-world testing, the system achieved over
90% task accuracy, up to 40% higher than baselines. PACT enabled a 5x model
size reduction while maintaining 75% accuracy. Saliency analysis showed
reliance on key visual cues, and phase token gradients peaked at critical
trajectory moments, indicating effective temporal reasoning. Future work will
explore bimanual manipulation and mobility for expanded assistive capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文对用于腿式机器人的前沿QP求解器进行了全面分析和基准测试，重点比较了不同算法在速度、精度和能效上的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在腿式机器人和操作中，QP是实时优化的核心，但嵌入式平台在时间、能量和计算资源上受限，需要可靠的求解器。

Method: 将QP求解器分为四类算法（内点法、主动集策略、算子分裂方案和增广拉格朗日法），分析其算法结构、计算特性及问题结构利用能力。

Result: 通过公开基准测试评估性能，发现稀疏内点法适合长时域MPC，密集主动集法适合高频WBC，并提供了求解器选择的实用指南。

Conclusion: 强调求解器、任务与硬件的协同，并展望了非凸和分布式QP的扩展应用。

Abstract: Quadratic programming (QP) underpins real-time robotics by enabling
efficient, constrained optimization in state estimation, motion planning, and
control. In legged locomotion and manipulation, essential modules like inverse
dynamics, Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Whole-Body Control (WBC) are
inherently QP-based, demanding reliable solutions amid tight timing, energy,
and computational limits on embedded platforms. This paper presents a
comprehensive analysis and benchmarking study of cutting-edge QP solvers for
legged robotics. We begin by formulating the standard convex QP and classify
solvers into four principal algorithmic approaches, including interior-point
methods, active-set strategies, operator splitting schemes, and augmented
Lagrangian approaches. Each solver is examined in terms of algorithmic
structure, computational characteristics, and its ability to exploit problem
structure and warm-starting. Performance is evaluated using publicly available
benchmarks, focusing on metrics such as computation time, constraint
satisfaction, and robustness under perturbations. Feature tables and
comparisons yield practical guidance for solver selection, underscoring
trade-offs in speed, accuracy, and energy efficiency. Our findings emphasize
the synergy between solver, task, and hardware, sparse IPMs for long-horizon
MPC, and dense active-set for high frequency WBC to advance agile, autonomous
legged systems, with emerging extensions to nonconvex and distributed QP.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型的交互范式僵化，无法同时处理多任务和实时中断，限制了用户体验。

Method: 采用双模型架构（Active Model和Standby Model），并引入模型即控制器范式，通过特殊令牌耦合推理与系统行为。

Result: 在物理人形平台上验证了VITA-E能可靠处理复杂交互场景，支持紧急停止和语音中断。

Conclusion: VITA-E显著提升了具身助手的自然性和能力，是迈向更智能交互的重要一步。

Abstract: Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are often constrained by a rigid,
static interaction paradigm, which lacks the ability to see, hear, speak, and
act concurrently as well as handle real-time user interruptions dynamically.
This hinders seamless embodied collaboration, resulting in an inflexible and
unresponsive user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce
VITA-E, a novel embodied interaction framework designed for both behavioral
concurrency and nearly real-time interruption. The core of our approach is a
dual-model architecture where two parallel VLA instances operate as an ``Active
Model'' and a ``Standby Model'', allowing the embodied agent to observe its
environment, listen to user speech, provide verbal responses, and execute
actions, all concurrently and interruptibly, mimicking human-like multitasking
capabilities. We further propose a ``model-as-controller'' paradigm, where we
fine-tune the VLM to generate special tokens that serve as direct system-level
commands, coupling the model's reasoning with the system's behavior.
Experiments conducted on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that VITA-E
can reliably handle complex interactive scenarios. Our framework is compatible
with various dual-system VLA models, achieving an extremely high success rate
on emergency stops and speech interruptions while also successfully performing
concurrent speech and action. This represents a significant step towards more
natural and capable embodied assistants.

Method: 研究通过外部仪器、约束系统运动和使用额外传感器等方法，探讨了多种校准技术。

Result: 研究发现逆运动学校准方法更简便有效，且研究多关注于无负载条件下的误差来源。

Conclusion: 本文总结了当前Stewart-Gough平台校准技术的研究现状，并强调了误差来源和校准过程的重要性。

Abstract: Researchers have studied Stewart-Gough platforms, also known as Gough-Stewart
platforms or hexapod platforms extensively for their inherent fine control
characteristics. Their studies led to the potential deployment opportunities of
Stewart-Gough Platforms in many critical applications such as the medical
field, engineering machines, space research, electronic chip manufacturing,
automobile manufacturing, etc. Some of these applications need micro and
nano-level movement control in 3D space for the motions to be precise,
complicated, and repeatable; a Stewart-Gough platform fulfills these challenges
smartly. For this, the platform must be more accurate than the specified
application accuracy level and thus proper calibration for a parallel robot is
crucial. Forward kinematics-based calibration for these hexapod machines
becomes unnecessarily complex and inverse kinematics complete this task with
much ease. To experiment with different calibration techniques, various
calibration approaches were implemented by using external instruments,
constraining one or more motions of the system, and using extra sensors for
auto or self-calibration. This survey paid attention to those key
methodologies, their outcome, and important details related to inverse
kinematic-based parallel robot calibrations. It was observed during this study
that the researchers focused on improving the accuracy of the platform position
and orientation considering the errors contributed by one source or multiple
sources. The error sources considered are mainly kinematic and structural, in
some cases, environmental factors also are reviewed, however, those
calibrations are done under no-load conditions. This study aims to review the
present state of the art in this field and highlight the processes and errors
considered for the calibration of Stewart-Gough platforms.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在物理世界中的实际智能表现，尤其是在脱离视觉语言动作（VLA）模型的情况下。

Method: 通过Butter-Bench测试LLMs在多步空间规划和社会理解等任务中的表现，并与人类表现对比。

Result: 最佳LLMs得分40%，人类平均得分95%；LLMs在多步空间规划和社会理解方面表现最差。

Conclusion: LLMs在物理世界中的实际智能表现仍有显著差距，且针对具身推理的微调未提升其表现。

Abstract: We present Butter-Bench, a benchmark evaluating large language model (LLM)
controlled robots for practical intelligence, defined as the ability to
navigate the messiness of the physical world. Current state-of-the-art robotic
systems use a hierarchical architecture with LLMs in charge of high-level
reasoning, and a Vision Language Action (VLA) model for low-level control.
Butter-Bench evaluates the LLM part in isolation from the VLA. Although LLMs
have repeatedly surpassed humans in evaluations requiring analytical
intelligence, we find humans still outperform LLMs on Butter-Bench. The best
LLMs score 40% on Butter-Bench, while the mean human score is 95%. LLMs
struggled the most with multi-step spatial planning and social understanding.
We also evaluate LLMs that are fine-tuned for embodied reasoning and conclude
that this training does not improve their score on Butter-Bench.

Motivation: 传统规划器在动态风场中生成的轨迹可能不光滑或次优，需要一种更高效且物理一致的方法。

Method: 使用PINN框架，将无人机动力学、风场扰动和避障直接嵌入学习过程，无需监督数据。

Result: 在控制能量、光滑度和安全裕度上优于A*和Kino-RRT*，同时保持相似的飞行效率。

Conclusion: 物理信息学习有望统一基于模型和数据驱动的规划，为无人机轨迹优化提供可扩展且物理一致的框架。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in dynamic wind fields must
generate safe and energy-efficient trajectories under physical and
environmental constraints. Traditional planners, such as A* and kinodynamic
RRT*, often yield suboptimal or non-smooth paths due to discretization and
sampling limitations. This paper presents a physics-informed neural network
(PINN) framework that embeds UAV dynamics, wind disturbances, and obstacle
avoidance directly into the learning process. Without requiring supervised
data, the PINN learns dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories by
minimizing physical residuals and risk-aware objectives. Comparative
simulations show that the proposed method outperforms A* and Kino-RRT* in
control energy, smoothness, and safety margin, while maintaining similar flight
efficiency. The results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning to
unify model-based and data-driven planning, providing a scalable and physically
consistent framework for UAV trajectory optimization.

Motivation: 扩散模型最初用于视觉任务，但在控制领域直接应用时未做适应性调整。本文旨在优化扩散策略，使其更适应机器人操作任务。

Method: 提出了一种基于种群的采样策略（遗传去噪），通过选择低分布外风险的轨迹来提升性能和稳定性。

Result: 在14个机器人操作任务中，该方法仅需2次神经函数评估即可解决复杂任务，性能提升高达20%。

Conclusion: 优化后的扩散策略在低计算成本下显著提升了机器人操作的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models, such as diffusion policy, have achieved state-of-the-art
results in robotic manipulation by imitating expert demonstrations. While
diffusion models were originally developed for vision tasks like image and
video generation, many of their inference strategies have been directly
transferred to control domains without adaptation. In this work, we show that
by tailoring the denoising process to the specific characteristics of embodied
AI tasks -- particularly structured, low-dimensional nature of action
distributions -- diffusion policies can operate effectively with as few as 5
neural function evaluations (NFE).
  Building on this insight, we propose a population-based sampling strategy,
genetic denoising, which enhances both performance and stability by selecting
denoising trajectories with low out-of-distribution risk. Our method solves
challenging tasks with only 2 NFE while improving or matching performance. We
evaluate our approach across 14 robotic manipulation tasks from D4RL and
Robomimic, spanning multiple action horizons and inference budgets. In over 2
million evaluations, our method consistently outperforms standard
diffusion-based policies, achieving up to 20\% performance gains with
significantly fewer inference steps.

Result: 预测的最小步频与实际值相符，揭示了前馈稳定机制的关键参数影响。

Conclusion: 研究为双足系统额状面稳定性提供了新见解，前馈控制可有效减少控制能耗。

Abstract: Stability of bipedal systems in frontal plane is affected by the hip offset,
to the extent that adjusting stride time using feedforward retraction and
extension of the legs can lead to stable oscillations without feedback control.
This feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to reduce the control effort
and energy expenditure and increase the locomotion robustness. However, there
is limited understanding of how key parameters, such as mass, stiffness, leg
length, and hip width, affect stability and the minimum stride frequency needed
to maintain it. This study aims to address these gaps through analyzing how
individual model parameters and the system's natural frequency influence the
minimum stride frequency required to maintain a stable cycle. We propose a
method to predict the minimum stride frequency, and compare the predicted
stride frequencies with actual values for randomly generated models. The
findings of this work provide a better understanding of the frontal plane
stability mechanisms and how feedforward stabilization can be leveraged to
reduce the control effort.

Abstract: Robotic manipulators are increasingly used to assist individuals with
mobility impairments in object retrieval. However, the predominant
joystick-based control interfaces can be challenging due to high precision
requirements and unintuitive reference frames. Recent advances in human-robot
interaction have explored alternative modalities, yet many solutions still rely
on external screens or restrictive control schemes, limiting their
intuitiveness and accessibility. To address these challenges, we present an
egocentric, gaze-guided robotic manipulation interface that leverages a
wearable Mixed Reality (MR) headset. Our system enables users to interact
seamlessly with real-world objects using natural gaze fixation from a
first-person perspective, while providing augmented visual cues to confirm
intent and leveraging a pretrained vision model and robotic arm for intent
recognition and object manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
approach significantly improves manipulation accuracy, reduces system latency,
and achieves single-pass intention and object recognition accuracy greater than
88% across multiple real-world scenarios. These results demonstrate the
system's effectiveness in enhancing intuitiveness and accessibility,
underscoring its practical significance for assistive robotics applications.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) attitude

universal, and lightweight simulation-to-reality reinforcement learning (RL)
framework for robust attitude control of UUVs. EasyUUV combines parallelized RL
training with a hybrid control architecture, where a learned policy outputs
high-level attitude corrections executed by an adaptive S-Surface controller. A
multimodal LLM is further integrated to adaptively tune controller parameters
at runtime using visual and textual feedback, enabling training-free adaptation
to unmodeled dynamics. Also, we have developed a low-cost 6-DoF UUV platform
and applied an RL policy trained through efficient parallelized simulation.

Abstract: Self-balancing exoskeletons offer a promising mobility solution for
individuals with lower-limb disabilities. For reliable long-term operation,
these exoskeletons require a perception system that is effective in changing
environments. In this work, we introduce LT-Exosense, a vision-centric,
multi-session mapping system designed to support long-term (semi)-autonomous
navigation for exoskeleton users. LT-Exosense extends single-session mapping
capabilities by incrementally fusing spatial knowledge across multiple
sessions, detecting environmental changes, and updating a persistent global
map. This representation enables intelligent path planning, which can adapt to
newly observed obstacles and can recover previous routes when obstructions are
removed. We validate LT-Exosense through several real-world experiments,
demonstrating a scalable multi-session map that achieves an average
point-to-point error below 5 cm when compared to ground-truth laser scans. We
also illustrate the potential application of adaptive path planning in
dynamically changing indoor environments.

Result: 在RoboCasa、DexMimicGen和真实世界SO-101任务中，ACG显著提升了动作连贯性和成功率。

Conclusion: ACG是一种有效的训练无关方法，能够显著提升VLA模型在精细操作任务中的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow matching models have emerged as powerful robot policies,
enabling Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to generalize across diverse
scenes and instructions. Yet, when trained via imitation learning, their high
generative capacity makes them sensitive to noise in human demonstrations:
jerks, pauses, and jitter which reduce action coherence. Reduced action
coherence causes instability and trajectory drift during deployment, failures
that are catastrophic in fine-grained manipulation where precision is crucial.
In this paper, we present Action Coherence Guidance (ACG) for VLA models, a
training-free test-time guidance algorithm that improves action coherence and
thereby yields performance gains. Evaluated on RoboCasa, DexMimicGen, and
real-world SO-101 tasks, ACG consistently improves action coherence and boosts
success rates across diverse manipulation tasks. Code and project page are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无人机在无结构环境中着陆时，纯视觉或深度学习模型因协变量偏移和可解释性不足而失败的问题。

Method: 采用神经符号框架，结合离线LLM生成符号知识与在线语义分割模型，通过几何计算生成场景图进行实时推理。

Conclusion: NeuroSymLand显著提升了无人机在紧急响应、监视和配送任务中的安全性和可靠性。

Abstract: Autonomous landing in unstructured (cluttered, uneven, and map-poor)
environments is a core requirement for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), yet
purely vision-based or deep learning models often falter under covariate shift
and provide limited interpretability. We propose NeuroSymLand, a neuro-symbolic
framework that tightly couples two complementary pipelines: (i) an offline
pipeline, where Large Language Models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop refinement
synthesize Scallop code from diverse landing scenarios, distilling
generalizable and verifiable symbolic knowledge; and (ii) an online pipeline,
where a compact foundation-based semantic segmentation model generates
probabilistic Scallop facts that are composed into semantic scene graphs for
real-time deductive reasoning. This design combines the perceptual strengths of
lightweight foundation models with the interpretability and verifiability of
symbolic reasoning. Node attributes (e.g., flatness, area) and edge relations
(adjacency, containment, proximity) are computed with geometric routines rather
than learned, avoiding the data dependence and latency of train-time graph
builders. The resulting Scallop program encodes landing principles (avoid water
and obstacles; prefer large, flat, accessible regions) and yields calibrated
safety scores with ranked Regions of Interest (ROIs) and human-readable
justifications. Extensive evaluations across datasets, diverse simulation maps,
and real UAV hardware show that NeuroSymLand achieves higher accuracy, stronger
robustness to covariate shift, and superior efficiency compared with
state-of-the-art baselines, while advancing UAV safety and reliability in
emergency response, surveillance, and delivery missions.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在几何结构有限的动态环境中显著优于现有LIO系统。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了动态环境中LIO的定位问题，提升了性能，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of Lidar-Inertial Odometry (LIO) in
dynamic environments, where conventional methods often fail due to their
static-world assumptions. Traditional LIO algorithms perform poorly when
dynamic objects dominate the scenes, particularly in geometrically sparse
environments. Current approaches to dynamic LIO face a fundamental challenge:
accurate localization requires a reliable identification of static features,
yet distinguishing dynamic objects necessitates precise pose estimation. Our
solution breaks this circular dependency by integrating dynamic awareness
directly into the point cloud registration process. We introduce a novel
dynamic-aware iterative closest point algorithm that leverages spatio-temporal
normal analysis, complemented by an efficient spatial consistency verification
method to enhance static map construction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate
significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LIO systems in
challenging dynamic environments with limited geometric structure. The code and

Abstract: Humanoid robots represent a central frontier in embodied intelligence, as
their anthropomorphic form enables natural deployment in humans' workspace.
Brain-body co-design for humanoids presents a promising approach to realizing
this potential by jointly optimizing control policies and physical morphology.
Within this context, fall recovery emerges as a critical capability. It not
only enhances safety and resilience but also integrates naturally with
locomotion systems, thereby advancing the autonomy of humanoids. In this paper,
we propose RoboCraft, a scalable humanoid co-design framework for fall recovery
that iteratively improves performance through the coupled updates of control
policy and morphology. A shared policy pretrained across multiple designs is
progressively finetuned on high-performing morphologies, enabling efficient
adaptation without retraining from scratch. Concurrently, morphology search is
guided by human-inspired priors and optimization algorithms, supported by a
priority buffer that balances reevaluation of promising candidates with the
exploration of novel designs. Experiments show that \ourmethod{} achieves an
average performance gain of 44.55% on seven public humanoid robots, with
morphology optimization drives at least 40% of improvements in co-designing
four humanoid robots, underscoring the critical role of humanoid co-design.

### [236] [Estimating Continuum Robot Shape under External Loading using Spatiotemporal Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22339)
*Enyi Wang,Zhen Deng,Chuanchuan Pan,Bingwei He,Jianwei Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的时空神经网络方法，用于精确估计受外部载荷影响的柔性连续机器人的3D形状。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在受载条件下对柔性连续机器人的形状估计精度不足，需要一种更精确的解决方案。

Method: 结合多模态输入（肌腱位移数据和RGB图像），通过时空神经网络生成点云，并拟合Bézier曲线实现连续3D形状重建。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在无载和受载条件下的平均形状估计误差分别为0.08毫米和0.22毫米，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 深度学习时空数据融合方法在受载条件下能有效实现高精度形状估计。

Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for accurately estimating the
3D shape of flexible continuum robots subjected to external loads. The proposed
method introduces a spatiotemporal neural network architecture that fuses
multi-modal inputs, including current and historical tendon displacement data
and RGB images, to generate point clouds representing the robot's deformed
configuration. The network integrates a recurrent neural module for temporal
feature extraction, an encoding module for spatial feature extraction, and a
multi-modal fusion module to combine spatial features extracted from visual
data with temporal dependencies from historical actuator inputs. Continuous 3D
shape reconstruction is achieved by fitting B\'ezier curves to the predicted
point clouds. Experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves
high precision, with mean shape estimation errors of 0.08 mm (unloaded) and
0.22 mm (loaded), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in shape sensing for
TDCRs. The results validate the efficacy of deep learning-based spatiotemporal
data fusion for precise shape estimation under loading conditions.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BLIP-FusePPO是一种新型多模态强化学习框架，用于自动驾驶车道保持，通过融合视觉语言模型的语义嵌入与几何状态、LiDAR观测和PID控制反馈，提升策略学习的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常仅使用语义模型来塑造奖励，而BLIP-FusePPO直接将语义特征嵌入状态表示，减少运行时推理开销并确保语义指导始终可用。

Method: 提出BLIP-FusePPO框架，融合视觉语言模型的语义嵌入与几何状态、LiDAR观测和PID控制反馈，设计包含语义对齐、车道保持精度、避障和速度调节的混合奖励函数。

Result: 仿真结果表明，BLIP-FusePPO在多种复杂驾驶场景中，车道保持稳定性和适应性优于现有基于视觉和多模态RL的基线方法。

Conclusion: BLIP-FusePPO通过直接嵌入语义特征和多模态融合，显著提升了自动驾驶车道保持的性能和鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining-driven
Fused State Representation in Proximal Policy Optimization (BLIP-FusePPO), a
novel multimodal reinforcement learning (RL) framework for autonomous
lane-keeping (LK), in which semantic embeddings generated by a vision-language
model (VLM) are directly fused with geometric states, LiDAR observations, and
Proportional-Integral-Derivative-based (PID) control feedback within the agent
observation space. The proposed method lets the agent learn driving rules that
are aware of their surroundings and easy to understand by combining high-level
scene understanding from the VLM with low-level control and spatial signals.
Our architecture brings together semantic, geometric, and control-aware
representations to make policy learning more robust. A hybrid reward function
that includes semantic alignment, LK accuracy, obstacle avoidance, and speed
regulation helps learning to be more efficient and generalizable. Our method is
different from the approaches that only use semantic models to shape rewards.
Instead, it directly embeds semantic features into the state representation.
This cuts down on expensive runtime inference and makes sure that semantic
guidance is always available. The simulation results show that the proposed
model is better at LK stability and adaptability than the best vision-based and
multimodal RL baselines in a wide range of difficult driving situations. We
make our code publicly available.

TL;DR: MTLHRL框架通过分层策略和Lyapunov稳定性约束，解决了高维随机系统的控制问题，显著提升了稳定性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维随机系统控制面临维度灾难、缺乏时间抽象和随机稳定性不足的问题，需要一种更高效和稳定的解决方案。

Method: MTLHRL结合分层策略（SMDP）和神经Lyapunov函数，通过多时间尺度actor-critic更新和信任区域约束优化控制策略。

Result: 在8D超混沌系统和5-DOF机器人上的实验显示，MTLHRL在稳定性和性能上显著优于基线方法，误差指数最低。

Conclusion: MTLHRL为复杂随机系统的鲁棒控制提供了理论支持和实际可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Controlling high-dimensional stochastic systems, critical in robotics,
autonomous vehicles, and hyperchaotic systems, faces the curse of
dimensionality, lacks temporal abstraction, and often fails to ensure
stochastic stability. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces the
Multi-Timescale Lyapunov-Constrained Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning
(MTLHRL) framework. MTLHRL integrates a hierarchical policy within a
semi-Markov Decision Process (SMDP), featuring a high-level policy for
strategic planning and a low-level policy for reactive control, which
effectively manages complex, multi-timescale decision-making and reduces
dimensionality overhead. Stability is rigorously enforced using a neural
Lyapunov function optimized via Lagrangian relaxation and multi-timescale
actor-critic updates, ensuring mean-square boundedness or asymptotic stability
in the face of stochastic dynamics. The framework promotes efficient and
reliable learning through trust-region constraints and decoupled optimization.
Extensive simulations on an 8D hyperchaotic system and a 5-DOF robotic
manipulator demonstrate MTLHRL's empirical superiority. It significantly
outperforms baseline methods in both stability and performance, recording the
lowest error indices (e.g., Integral Absolute Error (IAE): 3.912 in
hyperchaotic control and IAE: 1.623 in robotics), achieving faster convergence,
and exhibiting superior disturbance rejection. MTLHRL offers a theoretically
grounded and practically viable solution for robust control of complex
stochastic systems.

Abstract: Social Robot Navigation is the skill that allows robots to move efficiently
in human-populated environments while ensuring safety, comfort, and trust.
Unlike other areas of research, the scientific community has not yet achieved
an agreement on how Social Robot Navigation should be benchmarked. This is
notably important, as the lack of a de facto standard to benchmark Social Robot
Navigation can hinder the progress of the field and may lead to contradicting
conclusions. Motivated by this gap, we contribute with a short review focused
exclusively on benchmarking trends in the period from January 2020 to July
2025. Of the 130 papers identified by our search using IEEE Xplore, we analysed
the 85 papers that met the criteria of the review. This review addresses the
metrics used in the literature for benchmarking purposes, the algorithms
employed in such benchmarks, the use of human surveys for benchmarking, and how
conclusions are drawn from the benchmarking results, when applicable.

Result: 成功生成无需手动验证的唯一正向运动学解，适用于六自由度材料测试系统。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且实用，特别适用于复杂加载条件下的材料表征。

Abstract: This paper presents a method to generate feasible, unique forward-kinematic
solutions for a general Stewart platform. This is done by using inverse
kinematics to obtain valid workspace data and corresponding actuator lengths
for the moving platform. For parallel kinematic machines, such as the Stewart
Platform, inverse kinematics are straight forward, but the forward kinematics
are complex and generates multiple solutions due to the closed loop structure
of the kinematic links. In this research, a simple iterative algorithm has been
used employing modified Denavit-Hartenberg convention. The outcome is
encouraging as this method generates a single feasible forward kinematic
solution for each valid pose with the solved DH parameters and unlike earlier
forward kinematics solutions, this unique solution does not need to be manually
verified. Therefore, the forward kinematic solutions can be used directly for
further calculations without the need for manual pose verification. This
capability is essential for the six degree of freedom materials testing system
developed by the authors in their laboratory. The developed system is aimed at
characterizing additively manufactured materials under complex combined
multiple loading conditions. The material characterization is done by enabling
high precision force control on the moving platform via in situ calibration of
the as-built kinematics of the Stewart Gough Platform.

Motivation: 藤蔓机器人在复杂环境中具有潜力，但其性能受传感器或工具重量等因素限制，因此需要研究如何优化其可操纵性。

Abstract: Vine robots extend their tubular bodies by everting material from the tip,
enabling navigation in complex environments with a minimalist soft body.
Despite their promise for field applications, especially in the urban search
and rescue domain, performance is constrained by the weight of attached sensors
or tools, as well as other design and control choices. This work investigates
how tip load, pressure, length, diameter, and fabrication method shape vine
robot steerability--the ability to maneuver with controlled curvature--for
robots that steer with series pouch motor-style pneumatic actuators. We conduct
two groups of experiments: (1) studying tip load, chamber pressure, length, and
diameter in a robot supporting itself against gravity, and (2) studying
fabrication method and ratio of actuator to chamber pressure in a robot
supported on the ground. Results show that steerability decreases with
increasing tip load, is best at moderate chamber pressure, increases with
length, and is largely unaffected by diameter. Robots with actuators attached
on their exterior begin curving at low pressure ratios, but curvature saturates
at high pressure ratios; those with actuators integrated into the robot body
require higher pressure ratios to begin curving but achieve higher curvature
overall. We demonstrate that robots optimized with these principles outperform
those with ad hoc parameters in a mobility task that involves maximizing upward
and horizontal curvatures.

Method: 提出了两种控制器：一种是基于有限状态机（FSM）的刚性控制器，另一种是结合FSM和深度Q网络（DQN）的动态优化控制器。

Result: 模拟结果显示，两种控制器均减少了子群间的混合，DQN增强的控制器适应性更强，混合减少40-50%，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 研究表明，结合FSM和DQN的控制器在机器人群体空间分离任务中表现更优，具有更高的适应性和效率。

Abstract: In natural systems, emergent structures often arise to balance competing
demands. Army ants, for example, form temporary "walls" that prevent
interference between foraging trails. Inspired by this behavior, we developed
two decentralized controllers for heterogeneous robotic swarms to maintain
spatial separation while executing concurrent tasks. The first is a
finite-state machine (FSM)-based controller that uses encounter-triggered
transitions to create rigid, stable walls. The second integrates FSM states
with a Deep Q-Network (DQN), dynamically optimizing separation through emergent
"demilitarized zones." In simulation, both controllers reduce mixing between
subgroups, with the DQN-enhanced controller improving adaptability and reducing
mixing by 40-50% while achieving faster convergence.

Abstract: This paper introduces SPIRAL (Self-Play Incremental Racing Algorithm for
Learning), a novel approach for training autonomous drones in multi-agent
racing competitions. SPIRAL distinctively employs a self-play mechanism to
incrementally cultivate complex racing behaviors within a challenging, dynamic
environment. Through this self-play core, drones continuously compete against
increasingly proficient versions of themselves, naturally escalating the
difficulty of competitive interactions. This progressive learning journey
guides agents from mastering fundamental flight control to executing
sophisticated cooperative multi-drone racing strategies. Our method is designed
for versatility, allowing integration with any state-of-the-art Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms within its self-play framework.
Simulations demonstrate the significant advantages of SPIRAL and benchmark the
performance of various DRL algorithms operating within it. Consequently, we
contribute a versatile, scalable, and self-improving learning framework to the
field of autonomous drone racing. SPIRAL's capacity to autonomously generate
appropriate and escalating challenges through its self-play dynamic offers a
promising direction for developing robust and adaptive racing strategies in
multi-agent environments. This research opens new avenues for enhancing the
performance and reliability of autonomous racing drones in increasingly complex
and competitive scenarios.

Abstract: The coordination of multiple autonomous agents in high-speed, competitive
environments represents a significant engineering challenge. This paper
presents CRUISE (Curriculum-Based Iterative Self-Play for Scalable Multi-Drone
Racing), a reinforcement learning framework designed to solve this challenge in
the demanding domain of multi-drone racing. CRUISE overcomes key scalability
limitations by synergistically combining a progressive difficulty curriculum
with an efficient self-play mechanism to foster robust competitive behaviors.
Validated in high-fidelity simulation with realistic quadrotor dynamics, the
resulting policies significantly outperform both a standard reinforcement
learning baseline and a state-of-the-art game-theoretic planner. CRUISE
achieves nearly double the planner's mean racing speed, maintains high success
rates, and demonstrates robust scalability as agent density increases. Ablation
studies confirm that the curriculum structure is the critical component for
this performance leap. By providing a scalable and effective training
methodology, CRUISE advances the development of autonomous systems for dynamic,
competitive tasks and serves as a blueprint for future real-world deployment.

Result: 在Replica、TUM和真实场景中，RoGER-SLAM在轨迹精度和重建质量上优于其他3DGS-SLAM系统。

Conclusion: RoGER-SLAM在噪声和低光环境下显著提升了SLAM的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: The reliability of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is severely
constrained in environments where visual inputs suffer from noise and low
illumination. Although recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based SLAM
frameworks achieve high-fidelity mapping under clean conditions, they remain
vulnerable to compounded degradations that degrade mapping and tracking
performance. A key observation underlying our work is that the original 3DGS
rendering pipeline inherently behaves as an implicit low-pass filter,
attenuating high-frequency noise but also risking over-smoothing. Building on
this insight, we propose RoGER-SLAM, a robust 3DGS SLAM system tailored for
noise and low-light resilience. The framework integrates three innovations: a
Structure-Preserving Robust Fusion (SP-RoFusion) mechanism that couples
rendered appearance, depth, and edge cues; an adaptive tracking objective with
residual balancing regularization; and a Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining
(CLIP)-based enhancement module, selectively activated under compounded
degradations to restore semantic and structural fidelity. Comprehensive
experiments on Replica, TUM, and real-world sequences show that RoGER-SLAM
consistently improves trajectory accuracy and reconstruction quality compared
with other 3DGS-SLAM systems, especially under adverse imaging conditions.

Conclusion: 不确定性感知神经网络（尤其是RS-NNs）是提升自动驾驶安全性和鲁棒性的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicle (AV) perception systems have advanced rapidly in recent
years, providing vehicles with the ability to accurately interpret their
environment. Perception systems remain susceptible to errors caused by
overly-confident predictions in the case of rare events or out-of-sample data.
This study equips an autonomous vehicle with the ability to 'know when it is
uncertain', using an uncertainty-aware image classifier as part of the AV
software stack. Specifically, the study exploits the ability of Random-Set
Neural Networks (RS-NNs) to explicitly quantify prediction uncertainty. Unlike
traditional CNNs or Bayesian methods, RS-NNs predict belief functions over sets
of classes, allowing the system to identify and signal uncertainty clearly in
novel or ambiguous scenarios. The system is tested in a real-world autonomous
racing vehicle software stack, with the RS-NN classifying the layout of the
road ahead and providing the associated uncertainty of the prediction.
Performance of the RS-NN under a range of road conditions is compared against
traditional CNN and Bayesian neural networks, with the RS-NN achieving
significantly higher accuracy and superior uncertainty calibration. This
integration of RS-NNs into Robot Operating System (ROS)-based vehicle control
pipeline demonstrates that predictive uncertainty can dynamically modulate
vehicle speed, maintaining high-speed performance under confident predictions
while proactively improving safety through speed reductions in uncertain
scenarios. These results demonstrate the potential of uncertainty-aware neural
networks - in particular RS-NNs - as a practical solution for safer and more
robust autonomous driving.

Abstract: The growing need for autonomous on-orbit services such as inspection,
maintenance, and situational awareness calls for intelligent spacecraft capable
of complex maneuvers around large orbital targets. Traditional control systems
often fall short in adaptability, especially under model uncertainties,
multi-spacecraft configurations, or dynamically evolving mission contexts. This
paper introduces RL-AVIST, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Autonomous

we simulate high-fidelity 6-DOF spacecraft dynamics and train agents using
DreamerV3, a state-of-the-art model-based RL algorithm, with PPO and TD3 as
model-free baselines. Our investigation focuses on 3D proximity maneuvering
tasks around targets such as the Lunar Gateway and other space assets. We
evaluate task performance under two complementary regimes: generalized agents
trained on randomized velocity vectors, and specialized agents trained to
follow fixed trajectories emulating known inspection orbits. Furthermore, we
assess the robustness and generalization of policies across multiple spacecraft
morphologies and mission domains. Results demonstrate that model-based RL
offers promising capabilities in trajectory fidelity, and sample efficiency,
paving the way for scalable, retrainable control solutions for future space
operations

Result: 实验表明两种设计均能稳定抓取多种物体，且通过准静态分析提供了设计指导。

Conclusion: SCAL技术为环境自适应抓取提供了一种简单且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents environment-adaptive pinch-lifting built on a
slot-constrained adaptive linkage (SCAL) and instantiated in two complementary
fingers: SCAL-R, a rotational-drive design with an active fingertip that folds
inward after contact to form an envelope, and SCAL-L, a linear-drive design
that passively opens on contact to span wide or weak-feature objects. Both
fingers convert surface following into an upward lifting branch while
maintaining fingertip orientation, enabling thin or low-profile targets to be
raised from supports with minimal sensing and control. Two-finger grippers are
fabricated via PLA-based 3D printing. Experiments evaluate (i)
contact-preserving sliding and pinch-lifting on tabletops, (ii) ramp
negotiation followed by lift, and (iii) handling of bulky objects via active
enveloping (SCAL-R) or contact-triggered passive opening (SCAL-L). Across
dozens of trials on small parts, boxes, jars, and tape rolls, both designs
achieve consistent grasps with limited tuning. A quasi-static analysis provides
closed-form fingertip-force models for linear parallel pinching and two-point
enveloping, offering geometry-aware guidance for design and operation. Overall,
the results indicate complementary operating regimes and a practical path to
robust, environment-adaptive grasping with simple actuation.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，全局目标平均降低37.5%，推理效率提升至少6倍。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅高效且可扩展，无需重新训练即可适应更大规模的机器人团队。

Abstract: We consider the distributed pose-graph optimization (PGO) problem, which is
fundamental in accurate trajectory estimation in multi-robot simultaneous
localization and mapping (SLAM). Conventional iterative approaches linearize a
highly non-convex optimization objective, requiring repeated solving of normal
equations, which often converge to local minima and thus produce suboptimal
estimates. We propose a scalable, outlier-robust distributed planar PGO
framework using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). We cast distributed
PGO as a partially observable Markov game defined on local pose-graphs, where
each action refines a single edge's pose estimate. A graph partitioner
decomposes the global pose graph, and each robot runs a recurrent
edge-conditioned Graph Neural Network (GNN) encoder with adaptive edge-gating
to denoise noisy edges. Robots sequentially refine poses through a hybrid
policy that utilizes prior action memory and graph embeddings. After local
graph correction, a consensus scheme reconciles inter-robot disagreements to
produce a globally consistent estimate. Our extensive evaluations on a
comprehensive suite of synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
learned MARL-based actors reduce the global objective by an average of 37.5%
more than the state-of-the-art distributed PGO framework, while enhancing
inference efficiency by at least 6X. We also demonstrate that actor replication
allows a single learned policy to scale effortlessly to substantially larger
robot teams without any retraining. Code is publicly available at

and a global mapping module. The agents are equipped with sensors capable of
capturing textual information and detecting WiFi signals. By correlating these
data sources, TWC-SLAM establishes a common location, facilitating point cloud
alignment across different agents' maps. Furthermore, the system employs loop
closure detection and optimization modules to achieve global optimization and
cohesive mapping. We evaluated our approach using an indoor dataset featuring
similar corridors, rooms, and text signs. The results demonstrate that TWC-SLAM
significantly improves the performance of cooperative SLAM systems in complex
environments with repetitive architectural features.

*Guangyao Shi,Yuwei Wu,Vijay Kumar,Gaurav S. Sukhatme*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PIP-LLM框架通过团队级PDDL规划和机器人级整数规划，高效解决多机器人协调问题，提升任务成功率和负载均衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多机器人协调中存在任务分解脆弱、扩展性差和效率低的问题，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: PIP-LLM结合团队级PDDL规划和机器人级整数规划，通过依赖图指导任务分配，优化成本和负载。

Result: 实验表明，PIP-LLM提高了任务成功率，降低了旅行成本，并实现了更好的负载均衡。

Conclusion: PIP-LLM通过分离规划和分配，有效解决了多机器人协调的挑战，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires
translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description
Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches
struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor
scalability, and low coordination efficiency.
  We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists
of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based
robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the
command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level
plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a
subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a
dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a
dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each
subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem,
explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot
capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from
assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition
and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM
improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and
achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 简化运动模型难以捕捉机器人及其控制器的复杂闭环动力学，限制了预测能力。

Result: 在Vision 60四足机器人上成功实现了复杂环境中的肢体感知运动规划。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态机器人平台提供了高性能、碰撞感知规划的基础。

Abstract: Accurate full-body motion prediction is essential for the safe, autonomous
navigation of legged robots, enabling critical capabilities like limb-level
collision checking in cluttered environments. Simplified kinematic models often
fail to capture the complex, closed-loop dynamics of the robot and its
low-level controller, limiting their predictions to simple planar motion. To
address this, we present a learning-based observer-predictor framework that
accurately predicts this motion. Our method features a neural observer with
provable UUB guarantees that provides a reliable latent state estimate from a
history of proprioceptive measurements. This stable estimate initializes a
computationally efficient predictor, designed for the rapid, parallel
evaluation of thousands of potential trajectories required by modern
sampling-based planners. We validated the system by integrating our neural
predictor into an MPPI-based planner on a Vision 60 quadruped. Hardware
experiments successfully demonstrated effective, limb-aware motion planning in
a challenging, narrow passage and over small objects, highlighting our system's
ability to provide a robust foundation for high-performance, collision-aware
planning on dynamic robotic platforms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Analytical Swarm Chemistry的框架，结合工程、基于代理的研究和化学概念，系统探索群体参数如何影响涌现行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决群体机器人中难以预测涌现行为的问题，填补传统工程方法和自下而上研究之间的空白。

Method: 结合宏观状态定义和相图分析，将参数视为热力学变量，可视化参数空间中产生特定行为的区域。

Result: 在最小可行能力的代理中，识别了产生特定行为（如旋转和扩散）的充分条件，并在真实机器人上初步验证。

Conclusion: 该框架为实际群体系统提供了可预测和可靠的涌现行为方法。

Abstract: Swarm robotics has potential for a wide variety of applications, but
real-world deployments remain rare due to the difficulty of predicting emergent
behaviors arising from simple local interactions. Traditional engineering
approaches design controllers to achieve desired macroscopic outcomes under
idealized conditions, while agent-based and artificial life studies explore
emergent phenomena in a bottom-up, exploratory manner. In this work, we
introduce Analytical Swarm Chemistry, a framework that integrates concepts from
engineering, agent-based and artificial life research, and chemistry. This
framework combines macrostate definitions with phase diagram analysis to
systematically explore how swarm parameters influence emergent behavior.
Inspired by concepts from chemistry, the framework treats parameters like
thermodynamic variables, enabling visualization of regions in parameter space
that give rise to specific behaviors. Applying this framework to agents with
minimally viable capabilities, we identify sufficient conditions for behaviors
such as milling and diffusion and uncover regions of the parameter space that
reliably produce these behaviors. Preliminary validation on real robots
demonstrates that these regions correspond to observable behaviors in practice.
By providing a principled, interpretable approach, this framework lays the
groundwork for predictable and reliable emergent behavior in real-world swarm
systems.

<details>

Motivation: 增加电缆数量会减少旋转工作空间并导致张力解不唯一，影响机器人控制。

Method: 采用弹簧、螺旋槽轴和匹配螺母，将线性运动转换为旋转运动，并引入轴承增加旋转自由度。

Result: 扩展了旋转工作空间，使机构非冗余，无需额外张力传感即可通过运动学控制机器人。

Conclusion: 提出的末端执行器设计有效解决了电缆机器人的旋转工作空间和张力控制问题。

Abstract: To enlarge the translational workspace of cable-driven robots, one common
approach is to increase the number of cables. However, this introduces two
challenges: (1) cable interference significantly reduces the rotational
workspace, and (2) the solution of tensions in cables becomes non-unique,
resulting in difficulties for kinematic control of the robot. In this work, we
design structurally simple reconfigurable end-effectors for cable robots. By
incorporating a spring, a helical-grooved shaft, and a matching nut, relative
linear motions between end-effector components are converted into relative
rotations, thereby expanding the rotational workspace of the mechanism.
Meanwhile, a bearing is introduced to provide an additional rotational degree
of freedom, making the mechanism non-redundant. As a result, the robot's motion
can be controlled purely through kinematics without additional tension sensing
and control.

Result: 在7自由度Panda机械臂上的仿真实验表明，该方法能有效平衡动态任务中的竞争目标，性能优越。

Conclusion: LLM引导和Lyapunov约束的协同作用显著提升了机器人控制的适应性和稳定性。

Abstract: Robotic arms are increasingly deployed in uncertain environments, yet
conventional control pipelines often become rigid and brittle when exposed to
perturbations or incomplete information. Virtual Model Control (VMC) enables
compliant behaviors by embedding virtual forces and mapping them into joint
torques, but its reliance on fixed parameters and limited coordination among
virtual components constrains adaptability and may undermine stability as task
objectives evolve. To address these limitations, we propose Adaptive VMC with
Large Language Model (LLM)- and Lyapunov-Based Reinforcement Learning (RL),
which preserves the physical interpretability of VMC while supporting
stability-guaranteed online adaptation. The LLM provides structured priors and
high-level reasoning that enhance coordination among virtual components,
improve sample efficiency, and facilitate flexible adjustment to varying task
requirements. Complementarily, Lyapunov-based RL enforces theoretical stability
constraints, ensuring safe and reliable adaptation under uncertainty. Extensive
simulations on a 7-DoF Panda arm demonstrate that our approach effectively
balances competing objectives in dynamic tasks, achieving superior performance
while highlighting the synergistic benefits of LLM guidance and
Lyapunov-constrained adaptation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究多关注单一感知源，而人类自然结合局部和全局信息进行导航，因此需要整合这两种互补的感知模态。

Method: 提出HyPerNav，利用VLMs的推理和视觉语言理解能力，联合感知局部（RGB-D传感器）和全局（实时俯视图）信息。

Result: 在仿真和真实环境测试中，HyPerNav表现优于基线方法，能够更有效地捕捉线索并找到目标。

Conclusion: 混合感知方法显著提升了导航性能，局部和全局信息的结合均对结果有贡献。

Abstract: Objective-oriented navigation(ObjNav) enables robot to navigate to target
object directly and autonomously in an unknown environment. Effective
perception in navigation in unknown environment is critical for autonomous
robots. While egocentric observations from RGB-D sensors provide abundant local
information, real-time top-down maps offer valuable global context for ObjNav.
Nevertheless, the majority of existing studies focus on a single source, seldom
integrating these two complementary perceptual modalities, despite the fact
that humans naturally attend to both. With the rapid advancement of
Vision-Language Models(VLMs), we propose Hybrid Perception Navigation
(HyPerNav), leveraging VLMs' strong reasoning and vision-language understanding
capabilities to jointly perceive both local and global information to enhance
the effectiveness and intelligence of navigation in unknown environments. In
both massive simulation evaluation and real-world validation, our methods
achieved state-of-the-art performance against popular baselines. Benefiting
from hybrid perception approach, our method captures richer cues and finds the
objects more effectively, by simultaneously leveraging information
understanding from egocentric observations and the top-down map. Our ablation
study further proved that either of the hybrid perception contributes to the
navigation performance.

Abstract: This paper presents the complete design, control, and experimental validation
of a low-cost Stewart platform prototype developed as an affordable yet capable
robotic testbed for research and education. The platform combines off the shelf
components with 3D printed and custom fabricated parts to deliver full six
degrees of freedom motions using six linear actuators connecting a moving
platform to a fixed base. The system software integrates dynamic modeling, data
acquisition, and real time control within a unified framework. A robust
trajectory tracking controller based on feedback linearization, augmented with
an LQR scheme, compensates for the platform's nonlinear dynamics to achieve
precise motion control. In parallel, an Extended Kalman Filter fuses IMU and
actuator encoder feedback to provide accurate and reliable state estimation
under sensor noise and external disturbances. Unlike prior efforts that
emphasize only isolated aspects such as modeling or control, this work delivers
a complete hardware-software platform validated through both simulation and
experiments on static and dynamic trajectories. Results demonstrate effective
trajectory tracking and real-time state estimation, highlighting the platform's
potential as a cost effective and versatile tool for advanced research and
educational applications.

Abstract: This paper introduces an intelligent water-saving irrigation system designed
to address critical challenges in precision agriculture, such as inefficient
water use and poor terrain adaptability. The system integrates advanced
computer vision, robotic control, and real-time stabilization technologies via
a multi-sensor fusion approach. A lightweight YOLO model, deployed on an
embedded vision processor (K210), enables real-time plant container detection
with over 96% accuracy under varying lighting conditions. A simplified hand-eye
calibration algorithm-designed for 'handheld camera' robot arm
configurations-ensures that the end effector can be precisely positioned, with
a success rate exceeding 90%. The active leveling system, driven by the
STM32F103ZET6 main control chip and JY901S inertial measurement data, can
stabilize the irrigation platform on slopes up to 10 degrees, with a response
time of 1.8 seconds. Experimental results across three simulated agricultural
environments (standard greenhouse, hilly terrain, complex lighting) demonstrate
a 30-50% reduction in water consumption compared to conventional flood
irrigation, with water use efficiency exceeding 92% in all test cases.

Conclusion: 研究表明，将姿势相关的机器人先验知识融入双手机器人技能扩散中，能够显著提升其适应性和灵活性。

Abstract: Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in robot
bimanual skill learning. However, existing methods ignore the learning of
posture-dependent task features, which are crucial for adapting dual-arm
configurations to meet specific force and velocity requirements in dexterous
bimanual manipulation. To address this limitation, we propose
Manipulability-Aware Diffusion Policy (ManiDP), a novel imitation learning
method that not only generates plausible bimanual trajectories, but also
optimizes dual-arm configurations to better satisfy posture-dependent task
requirements. ManiDP achieves this by extracting bimanual manipulability from
expert demonstrations and encoding the encapsulated posture features using
Riemannian-based probabilistic models. These encoded posture features are then
incorporated into a conditional diffusion process to guide the generation of
task-compatible bimanual motion sequences. We evaluate ManiDP on six real-world
bimanual tasks, where the experimental results demonstrate a 39.33$\%$ increase
in average manipulation success rate and a 0.45 improvement in task
compatibility compared to baseline methods. This work highlights the importance
of integrating posture-relevant robotic priors into bimanual skill diffusion to
enable human-like adaptability and dexterity.

Conclusion: Seq-DeepIPC为腿式机器人提供了高效、端到端的导航解决方案，并计划开源代码以支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present Seq-DeepIPC, a sequential end-to-end perception-to-control model
for legged robot navigation in realworld environments. Seq-DeepIPC advances
intelligent sensing for autonomous legged navigation by tightly integrating
multi-modal perception (RGB-D + GNSS) with temporal fusion and control. The
model jointly predicts semantic segmentation and depth estimation, giving
richer spatial features for planning and control. For efficient deployment on
edge devices, we use EfficientNet-B0 as the encoder, reducing computation while
maintaining accuracy. Heading estimation is simplified by removing the noisy
IMU and instead computing the bearing angle directly from consecutive GNSS
positions. We collected a larger and more diverse dataset that includes both
road and grass terrains, and validated Seq-DeepIPC on a robot dog. Comparative
and ablation studies show that sequential inputs improve perception and control
in our models, while other baselines do not benefit. Seq-DeepIPC achieves
competitive or better results with reasonable model size; although GNSS-only
heading is less reliable near tall buildings, it is robust in open areas.
Overall, Seq-DeepIPC extends end-to-end navigation beyond wheeled robots to
more versatile and temporally-aware systems. To support future research, we
will release the codes to our GitHub repository at

Result: 综合评估表明，该方法在不同测试对象上实现了准确且多样化的面部模仿。

Conclusion: 该方法为人形机器人自主获取表情能力提供了有效解决方案，并开源了首个相关数据集。

Abstract: The facial expression generation capability of humanoid social robots is
critical for achieving natural and human-like interactions, playing a vital
role in enhancing the fluidity of human-robot interactions and the accuracy of
emotional expression. Currently, facial expression generation in humanoid
social robots still relies on pre-programmed behavioral patterns, which are
manually coded at high human and time costs. To enable humanoid robots to
autonomously acquire generalized expressive capabilities, they need to develop
the ability to learn human-like expressions through self-training. To address
this challenge, we have designed a highly biomimetic robotic face with
physical-electronic animated facial units and developed an end-to-end learning
framework based on KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network) and attention mechanisms.
Unlike previous humanoid social robots, we have also meticulously designed an
automated data collection system based on expert strategies of facial motion
primitives to construct the dataset. Notably, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the first open-source facial dataset for humanoid social robots.
Comprehensive evaluations indicate that our approach achieves accurate and
diverse facial mimicry across different test subjects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盘旋行为增加了微型飞行器的能量消耗和发散风险，需要一种方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用控制切换方法SAOS，结合攻角到INDI控制器中，改善力估计。

Result: 模拟和风洞实验表明，SAOS提高了位置收敛性，减少了油门使用，并减轻了俯仰-滚转耦合引起的滚转振荡。

Conclusion: SAOS在受限的滑翔环境中显著提升了能量效率和飞行稳定性。

Abstract: Orographic soaring can significantly extend the endurance of micro aerial
vehicles (MAVs), but circling behavior, arising from control conflicts between
the longitudinal and vertical axes, increases energy consumption and the risk
of divergence. We propose a control switching method, named SAOS: Switched
Control for Autonomous Orographic Soaring, which mitigates circling behavior by
selectively controlling either the horizontal or vertical axis, effectively
transforming the system from underactuated to fully actuated during soaring.
Additionally, the angle of attack is incorporated into the INDI controller to
improve force estimation. Simulations with randomized initial positions and
wind tunnel experiments on two MAVs demonstrate that the SAOS improves position
convergence, reduces throttle usage, and mitigates roll oscillations caused by
pitch-roll coupling. These improvements enhance energy efficiency and flight
stability in constrained soaring environments.

Abstract: This paper deals with the design of a cost effective automated tape laying
system (ATL system) with integrated uniaxial force control to ensure the
necessary compaction forces as well as with an accurate temperature control to
guarantee the used tape being melted appropriate. It is crucial to control the
substrate and the oncoming tape onto a specific temperature level to ensure an
optimal consolidation between the different layers of the product. Therefore,
it takes several process steps from the spooled tape on the coil until it is
finally tacked onto the desired mold. The different modules are divided into
the tape storage spool, a tape-guiding roller, a tape processing unit, a
heating zone and the consolidation unit. Moreover, a special robot control
concept for testing the ATL system is presented. In contrast to many other
systems, with this approach, the tape laying device is spatially fixed and the
shape is moved accordingly by the robot, which allows for handling of rather
compact and complex shapes. The functionality of the subsystems and the taping
process itself was finally approved in experimental results using a carbon
fiber reinforced HDPE tape.

Conclusion: OmniDexGrasp通过结合基础模型和转移控制策略，成功实现了全能力的灵巧抓取和操作任务。

Abstract: Enabling robots to dexterously grasp and manipulate objects based on human
commands is a promising direction in robotics. However, existing approaches are
challenging to generalize across diverse objects or tasks due to the limited
scale of semantic dexterous grasp datasets. Foundation models offer a new way
to enhance generalization, yet directly leveraging them to generate feasible
robotic actions remains challenging due to the gap between abstract model
knowledge and physical robot execution. To address these challenges, we propose
OmniDexGrasp, a generalizable framework that achieves omni-capabilities in user
prompting, dexterous embodiment, and grasping tasks by combining foundation
models with the transfer and control strategies. OmniDexGrasp integrates three
key modules: (i) foundation models are used to enhance generalization by
generating human grasp images supporting omni-capability of user prompt and
task; (ii) a human-image-to-robot-action transfer strategy converts human
demonstrations into executable robot actions, enabling omni dexterous
embodiment; (iii) force-aware adaptive grasp strategy ensures robust and stable
grasp execution. Experiments in simulation and on real robots validate the
effectiveness of OmniDexGrasp on diverse user prompts, grasp task and dexterous
hands, and further results show its extensibility to dexterous manipulation
tasks.

Result: 在门把手抓取和物体放置任务中，异常检测和恢复显著提高了执行成功率。

Conclusion: 结合异常检测和恢复的学习策略能有效应对开放环境中的复杂性和不确定性。

Abstract: Learned robot policies have consistently been shown to be versatile, but they
typically have no built-in mechanism for handling the complexity of open
environments, making them prone to execution failures; this implies that
deploying policies without the ability to recognise and react to failures may
lead to unreliable and unsafe robot behaviour. In this paper, we present a
framework that couples a learned policy with a method to detect visual
anomalies during policy deployment and to perform recovery behaviours when
necessary, thereby aiming to prevent failures. Specifically, we train an
anomaly detection model using data collected during nominal executions of a
trained policy. This model is then integrated into the online policy execution
process, so that deviations from the nominal execution can trigger a
three-level sequential recovery process that consists of (i) pausing the
execution temporarily, (ii) performing a local perturbation of the robot's
state, and (iii) resetting the robot to a safe state by sampling from a learned
execution success model. We verify our proposed method in two different
scenarios: (i) a door handle reaching task with a Kinova Gen3 arm using a
policy trained in simulation and transferred to the real robot, and (ii) an
object placing task with a UFactory xArm 6 using a general-purpose policy
model. Our results show that integrating policy execution with anomaly
detection and recovery increases the execution success rate in environments
with various anomalies, such as trajectory deviations and adversarial human
interventions.

Abstract: The deployment of mobile robots for material handling in industrial
environments requires scalable coordination of large fleets in dynamic
settings. This paper presents a two-layer framework that combines high-level
scheduling with low-level control. Tasks are assigned and scheduled using the
compositional algorithm ComSat, which generates time-parameterized routes for
each robot. These schedules are then used by a distributed Model Predictive
Control (MPC) system in real time to compute local reference trajectories,
accounting for static and dynamic obstacles. The approach ensures safe,
collision-free operation, and supports rapid rescheduling in response to
disruptions such as robot failures or environmental changes. We evaluate the
method in simulated 2D environments with varying road capacities and traffic
conditions, demonstrating high task completion rates and robust behavior even
under congestion. The modular structure of the framework allows for
computational tractability and flexibility, making it suitable for deployment
in complex, real-world industrial scenarios.

Motivation: 固定频率控制在机器人学中存在效率与鲁棒性的权衡，而生物系统却能灵活适应。论文旨在通过自适应频率控制解决这一问题。

Method: 采用强化学习方法，策略同时选择控制动作及其持续时间，实现控制频率的自主调节。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了机器人控制频率的自适应调节，为机器人控制提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Fixed-frequency control in robotics imposes a trade-off between the
efficiency of low-frequency control and the robustness of high-frequency
control, a limitation not seen in adaptable biological systems. We address this
with a reinforcement learning approach in which policies jointly select control
actions and their application durations, enabling robots to autonomously
modulate their control frequency in response to situational demands. We
validate our method with zero-shot sim-to-real experiments on two distinct
hardware platforms: a high-speed RC car and a quadrupedal robot. Our method
matches or outperforms fixed-frequency baselines in terms of rewards while
significantly reducing the control frequency and exhibiting adaptive frequency
control under real-world conditions.

TL;DR: 研究探讨机器人是否因其价值感知能力（理解人类原则）而更易影响人类决策。实验表明，参与者能区分价值感知与非价值感知机器人，且更关注前者，但未在明确选择中表现出偏好。价值感知机器人被认为更忠诚，且机器人意见分歧会引发决策犹豫。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器人价值感知能力对人类决策的影响，以评估社交机器人在引导反思或潜在操纵中的双重作用。

Method: 设计实验，参与者与价值感知和非价值感知的Furhat机器人互动，完成图像标注任务，记录选择、注视行为及感知评价。

Result: 参与者能区分机器人类型，更注视价值感知机器人，认为其更忠诚。机器人意见分歧时，25%的试验中参与者顺从，且决策时间延长。

Conclusion: 机器人价值感知能力可增强其影响力，但需警惕潜在操纵风险；同时，社交机器人或能促进反思，帮助用户避免欺诈。

Abstract: This study investigates whether the opinions of robotic agents are more
likely to influence human decision-making when the robots are perceived as
value-aware (i.e., when they display an understanding of human principles). We
designed an experiment in which participants interacted with two Furhat robots
- one programmed to be Value-Aware and the other Non-Value-Aware - during a
labeling task for images representing human values. Results indicate that
participants distinguished the Value-Aware robot from the Non-Value-Aware one.
Although their explicit choices did not indicate a clear preference for one
robot over the other, participants directed their gaze more toward the
Value-Aware robot. Additionally, the Value-Aware robot was perceived as more
loyal, suggesting that value awareness in a social robot may enhance its
perceived commitment to the group. Finally, when both robots disagreed with the
participant, conformity occurred in about one out of four trials, and
participants took longer to confirm their responses, suggesting that two robots
expressing dissent may introduce hesitation in decision-making. On one hand,
this highlights the potential risk that robots, if misused, could manipulate
users for unethical purposes. On the other hand, it reinforces the idea that
social robots might encourage reflection in ambiguous situations and help users
avoid scams.

Result: 通过Pareto前沿选择最终几何形状，平衡寿命和振动特性。

Conclusion: 方法适用于三自由度关节机器人，展示了设计与控制的协同优化。

Abstract: Resourceful operation and design of robots is key for sustainable industrial
automation. This will be enabled by lightweight design along with time and
energy optimal control of robotic manipulators. Design and control of such
systems is intertwined as the control must take into account inherent
mechanical compliance while the design must accommodate the dynamic
requirements demanded by the control. As basis for such design optimization, a
method for estimating the lifetime of elastic link robotic manipulators is
presented. This is applied to the geometry optimization of flexible serial
manipulators performing pick-and-place operations, where the optimization
objective is a combination of overall weight and vibration amplitudes. The
lifetime estimation draws from a fatigue analysis combining the rainflow
counting algorithm and the method of critical cutting plane. Tresca hypothesis
is used to formulate an equivalent stress, and linear damage accumulation is
assumed. The final robot geometry is selected from a Pareto front as a tradeoff
of lifetime and vibration characteristic. The method is illustrated for a three
degrees of freedom articulated robotic manipulator.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实环境中机器人导航的探索与目标导航的统一问题，通过最小化预期自由能（EFE）结合认知与外在价值。

Method: 采用扩散策略生成多样化候选动作，利用多时间尺度递归状态空间模型（MTRSSM）预测动作的长期后果，通过潜在想象选择最小化EFE的动作。

Result: 真实世界导航实验显示，该框架在探索需求高的场景中成功率和碰撞率优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于EFE最小化的主动推理框架能有效统一真实环境中的探索与目标导航。

Abstract: Autonomous robotic navigation in real-world environments requires exploration
to acquire environmental information as well as goal-directed navigation in
order to reach specified targets. Active inference (AIF) based on the
free-energy principle provides a unified framework for these behaviors by
minimizing the expected free energy (EFE), thereby combining epistemic and
extrinsic values. To realize this practically, we propose a deep AIF framework
that integrates a diffusion policy as the policy model and a multiple timescale
recurrent state-space model (MTRSSM) as the world model. The diffusion policy
generates diverse candidate actions while the MTRSSM predicts their
long-horizon consequences through latent imagination, enabling action selection
that minimizes EFE. Real-world navigation experiments demonstrated that our
framework achieved higher success rates and fewer collisions compared with the
baselines, particularly in exploration-demanding scenarios. These results
highlight how AIF based on EFE minimization can unify exploration and
goal-directed navigation in real-world robotic settings.

TL;DR: 提出了一种紧密耦合的导航框架，通过精确时间同步和延迟测量策略，显著提高了水下集成导航系统的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多传感器系统中的时间同步问题，尤其是水下集成导航系统中的声学定位延迟，会显著降低精度。

Method: 结合被动倒置超短基线（piUSBL）、惯性导航系统（SINS）和深度计，通过同步时间和声学信号处理量化延迟。

Result: 延迟补偿后的导航系统将均方根误差降低了40.45%，最大误差降低了32.55%。

Conclusion: 精确的延迟测量和补偿不仅提高了水下导航精度，还为多传感器系统的时间同步和数据融合提供了通用框架。

Abstract: In multi-sensor systems, time synchronization between sensors is a
significant challenge, and this issue is particularly pronounced in underwater
integrated navigation systems incorporating acoustic positioning. Such systems
are highly susceptible to time delay, which can significantly degrade accuracy
when measurement and fusion moments are misaligned. To address this challenge,
this paper introduces a tightly coupled navigation framework that integrates a
passive inverted ultra-short baseline (piUSBL) acoustic positioning system, a
strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS), and a depth gauge under precise
time synchronization. The framework fuses azimuth and slant range from the
piUSBL with depth data, thereby avoiding poor vertical-angle observability in
planar arrays. A novel delay measurement strategy is introduced, combining
synchronized timing with acoustic signal processing, which redefines
delay-traditionally an unobservable error-into a quantifiable parameter,
enabling explicit estimation of both acoustic propagation and system processing
delays. Simulations and field experiments confirm the feasibility of the
proposed method, with delay-compensated navigation reducing RMSE by 40.45% and
maximum error by 32.55%. These findings show that precise delay measurement and
compensation not only enhance underwater navigation accuracy but also establish
a generalizable framework for acoustic positioning integration, offering
valuable insights into time alignment and data fusion in latency-sensitive
multi-sensor systems.

Result: 陆地训练的DRL策略在月球模拟中接近50%成功率，无需额外训练。

Conclusion: 跨域DRL策略迁移是开发高效自主导航的有前景方法，可减少再训练成本。

Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments is essential for field and
planetary robotics, where robots must efficiently reach goals while avoiding
obstacles under uncertain conditions. Conventional algorithmic approaches often
require extensive environment-specific tuning, limiting scalability to new
domains. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) provides a data-driven alternative,
allowing robots to acquire navigation strategies through direct interactions
with their environment. This work investigates the feasibility of DRL policy
generalization across visually and topographically distinct simulated domains,
where policies are trained in terrestrial settings and validated in a zero-shot
manner in extraterrestrial environments. A 3D simulation of an agricultural
rover is developed and trained using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to
achieve goal-directed navigation and obstacle avoidance in farmland settings.
The learned policy is then evaluated in a lunar-like simulated environment to
assess transfer performance. The results indicate that policies trained under
terrestrial conditions retain a high level of effectiveness, achieving close to
50\% success in lunar simulations without the need for additional training and
fine-tuning. This underscores the potential of cross-domain DRL-based policy
transfer as a promising approach to developing adaptable and efficient
autonomous navigation for future planetary exploration missions, with the added
benefit of minimizing retraining costs.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) and robotics,
service robots are increasingly becoming an integral part of daily life,
offering a wide range of services in complex environments. To deliver these
services intelligently and efficiently, robust and accurate task planning
capabilities are essential. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the
integration of LLMs into service robotics, with a particular focus on their
role in enhancing robotic task planning. First, the development and
foundational techniques of LLMs, including pre-training, fine-tuning,
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and prompt engineering, are reviewed. We
then explore the application of LLMs as the cognitive core-`brain'-of service
robots, discussing how LLMs contribute to improved autonomy and
decision-making. Furthermore, recent advancements in LLM-driven task planning
across various input modalities are analyzed, including text, visual, audio,
and multimodal inputs. Finally, we summarize key challenges and limitations in
current research and propose future directions to advance the task planning
capabilities of service robots in complex, unstructured domestic environments.
This review aims to serve as a valuable reference for researchers and
practitioners in the fields of artificial intelligence and robotics.

Result: 通过仿真和实验验证，T-ESKF在性能上优于或至少与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: T-ESKF是一种一致的VINS估计器，有效解决了可观测性问题，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to address the inconsistency problem
caused by observability mismatch in visual-inertial navigation systems (VINS).
The key idea involves applying a linear time-varying transformation to the
error-state within the Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF). This transformation
ensures that \textrr{the unobservable subspace of the transformed error-state
system} becomes independent of the state, thereby preserving the correct
observability of the transformed system against variations in linearization
points. We introduce the Transformed ESKF (T-ESKF), a consistent VINS estimator
that performs state estimation using the transformed error-state system.
Furthermore, we develop an efficient propagation technique to accelerate the
covariance propagation based on the transformation relationship between the
transition and accumulated matrices of T-ESKF and ESKF. We validate the
proposed method through extensive simulations and experiments, demonstrating
better (or competitive at least) performance compared to state-of-the-art
methods. The code is available at github.com/HITCSC/T-ESKF.

Motivation: 重型液压机械臂（HHMs）由于体积大、功率高和复杂的非线性动力学，操作时需严格遵守物理和安全约束，但实时控制框架中对此研究不足。

Method: 结合多射击策略和实时传感器反馈的NMPC框架，并采用基于虚拟分解控制（VDC）的鲁棒底层控制器进行精确关节跟踪。

Result: 实验验证表明，NMPC框架不仅能在关节层面强制执行约束，还能确保末端执行器在笛卡尔空间中的约束合规运动。

Conclusion: 该方法在严格遵循安全限制的同时实现了高精度轨迹跟踪，为大型液压系统的实时控制设定了新标准。

Abstract: Heavy-duty hydraulic manipulators (HHMs) operate under strict physical and
safety-critical constraints due to their large size, high power, and complex
nonlinear dynamics. Ensuring that both joint-level and end-effector
trajectories remain compliant with actuator capabilities, such as force,
velocity, and position limits, is essential for safe and reliable operation,
yet remains largely underexplored in real-time control frameworks. This paper
presents a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework designed to
guarantee constraint satisfaction throughout the full nonlinear dynamics of
HHMs, while running at a real-time control frequency of 1 kHz. The proposed
method combines a multiple-shooting strategy with real-time sensor feedback,
and is supported by a robust low-level controller based on virtual
decomposition control (VDC) for precise joint tracking. Experimental validation
on a full-scale hydraulic manipulator shows that the NMPC framework not only
enforces actuator constraints at the joint level, but also ensures
constraint-compliant motion in Cartesian space for the end-effector. These
results demonstrate the method's capability to deliver high-accuracy trajectory
tracking while strictly respecting safety-critical limits, setting a new
benchmark for real-time control in large-scale hydraulic systems.

Abstract: To understand and collaborate with humans, robots must account for individual
human traits, habits, and activities over time. However, most robotic
assistants lack these abilities, as they primarily focus on predefined tasks in
structured environments and lack a human model to learn from. This work
introduces COOPERA, a novel framework for COntinual, OPen-Ended human-Robot

long-term intentions, interact with robots in complex environments. By
integrating continuous human feedback, our framework, for the first time,
enables the study of long-term, open-ended human-robot collaboration (HRC) in
different collaborative tasks across various time-scales. Within COOPERA, we
introduce a benchmark and an approach to personalize the robot's collaborative
actions by learning human traits and context-dependent intents. Experiments
validate the extent to which our simulated humans reflect realistic human
behaviors and demonstrate the value of inferring and personalizing to human
intents for open-ended and long-term HRC. Project Page:

Result: 实验表明NaviWM提高了成功率并减少社交违规，尤其在拥挤环境中。

Conclusion: 结合形式化推理与LLM能实现更鲁棒的社交导航。

Abstract: Social robot navigation increasingly relies on large language models for
reasoning, path planning, and enabling movement in dynamic human spaces.
However, relying solely on LLMs for planning often leads to unpredictable and
unsafe behaviors, especially in dynamic human spaces, due to limited physical
grounding and weak logical consistency. In this work, we introduce NaviWM, a
socially-aware robot Navigation World Model that augments LLM reasoning with a
structured world model and a logic-driven chain-of-thought process. NaviWM
consists of two main components: (1) a spatial-temporal world model that
captures the positions, velocities, and activities of agents in the
environment, and (2) a deductive reasoning module that guides LLMs through a
multi-step, logic-based inference process. This integration enables the robot
to generate navigation decisions that are both socially compliant and
physically safe, under well-defined constraints such as personal space,
collision avoidance, and timing. Unlike previous methods based on prompting or
fine-tuning, NaviWM encodes social norms as first-order logic, enabling
interpretable and verifiable reasoning. Experiments show that NaviWM improves
success rates and reduces social violations, particularly in crowded
environments. These results demonstrate the benefit of combining formal
reasoning with LLMs for robust social navigation. Additional experimental

Abstract: Despite their mechanical sophistication, surgical robots remain blind to
their surroundings. This lack of spatial awareness causes collisions, system
recoveries, and workflow disruptions, issues that will intensify with the
introduction of distributed robots with independent interacting arms. Existing
tracking systems rely on bulky infrared cameras and reflective markers,
providing only limited views of the surgical scene and adding hardware burden
in crowded operating rooms. We present a marker-free proprioception method that
enables precise localisation of surgical robots under their sterile draping
despite associated obstruction of visual cues. Our method solely relies on
lightweight stereo-RGB cameras and novel transformer-based deep learning
models. It builds on the largest multi-centre spatial robotic surgery dataset
to date (1.4M self-annotated images from human cadaveric and preclinical in
vivo studies). By tracking the entire robot and surgical scene, rather than
individual markers, our approach provides a holistic view robust to occlusions,
supporting surgical scene understanding and context-aware control. We
demonstrate an example of potential clinical benefits during in vivo breathing
compensation with access to tissue dynamics, unobservable under state of the
art tracking, and accurately locate in multi-robot systems for future
intelligent interaction. In addition, and compared with existing systems, our
method eliminates markers and improves tracking visibility by 25%. To our
knowledge, this is the first demonstration of marker-free proprioception for
fully draped surgical robots, reducing setup complexity, enhancing safety, and
paving the way toward modular and autonomous robotic surgery.

Motivation: 现有视频分割算法通常不使用对象级记忆或仅依赖隐式记忆（如RNN特征），导致预测不够准确和一致。

Method: 开发了在线3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）技术存储预测对象片段，并设计了FastSAM-Splat和SAM2-Splat融合技术。

Result: 实验表明，使用显式3D记忆的模型比无记忆或仅隐式记忆的模型更准确和一致。

Conclusion: 显式3D记忆能有效提升视频分割模型的性能。

Abstract: Remembering where object segments were predicted in the past is useful for
improving the accuracy and consistency of class-agnostic video segmentation
algorithms. Existing video segmentation algorithms typically use either no
object-level memory (e.g. FastSAM) or they use implicit memories in the form of
recurrent neural network features (e.g. SAM2). In this paper, we augment both
types of segmentation models using an explicit 3D memory and show that the
resulting models have more accurate and consistent predictions. For this, we
develop an online 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique to store predicted
object-level segments generated throughout the duration of a video. Based on
this 3DGS representation, a set of fusion techniques are developed, named
FastSAM-Splat and SAM2-Splat, that use the explicit 3DGS memory to improve
their respective foundation models' predictions. Ablation experiments are used
to validate the proposed techniques' design and hyperparameter settings.
Results from both real-world and simulated benchmarking experiments show that
models which use explicit 3D memories result in more accurate and consistent

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人策略测试方法存在劳动密集、缓慢、不安全且难以复现的问题，仿真基准也局限于相同合成领域，无法评估真实世界训练的模型。

Method: 利用视觉语言模型、2D到3D生成建模和可微分渲染，将视频演示转换为模拟环境，结合自动评分和人类偏好评估策略。

Result: 开发了一个可扩展、可复现的机器人操作策略基准，通过系统扰动环境测试策略的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架填补了当前机器人领域的关键空白，为通用机器人策略的评估提供了持续演进的解决方案。

Abstract: The pursuit of robot generalists - instructable agents capable of performing
diverse tasks across diverse environments - demands rigorous and scalable
evaluation. Yet real-world testing of robot policies remains fundamentally
constrained: it is labor-intensive, slow, unsafe at scale, and difficult to
reproduce. Existing simulation benchmarks are similarly limited, as they train
and test policies within the same synthetic domains and cannot assess models
trained from real-world demonstrations or alternative simulation environments.
As policies expand in scope and complexity, these barriers only intensify,
since defining "success" in robotics often hinges on nuanced human judgments of
execution quality. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmarking framework
that overcomes these challenges by shifting VLA evaluation into large-scale
simulated environments augmented with online human feedback. Leveraging
advances in vision-language models, 2D-to-3D generative modeling, and
differentiable rendering, our approach automatically converts video
demonstrations from widely used robot datasets into simulated counterparts.
Within these digital twins, we assess VLA policies using both automated
VLM-guided scoring and scalable human preference judgments collected from
crowdworkers, transforming human involvement from tedious scene setup,
resetting, and safety supervision into lightweight preference comparisons. To
measure robustness, we systematically perturb simulated environments along
multiple axes, such as textures and object placements, stress-testing policy
generalization under controlled variation. The result is a continuously
evolving, reproducible, and scalable benchmark for real-world trained robot
manipulation policies, addressing a critical missing capability in today's
robotics landscape.

TL;DR: UrbanVLA是一个基于视觉-语言-动作（VLA）的框架，用于大规模城市导航，通过两阶段训练实现低层次和高层次导航能力，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决城市微移动应用（如送货机器人）在大规模动态城市环境中导航的挑战，现有方法多局限于短距离可控场景。

Method: 提出UrbanVLA框架，通过两阶段训练（监督微调和强化微调）结合模拟和真实数据，实现视觉观察与路径规划的动态对齐。

Result: 在MetaUrban的SocialNav任务中性能提升55%以上，并在真实环境中展示了可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: UrbanVLA为大规模城市导航提供了可靠解决方案，兼具适应性和安全性。

Abstract: Urban micromobility applications, such as delivery robots, demand reliable
navigation across large-scale urban environments while following long-horizon
route instructions. This task is particularly challenging due to the dynamic
and unstructured nature of real-world city areas, yet most existing navigation
methods remain tailored to short-scale and controllable scenarios. Effective
urban micromobility requires two complementary levels of navigation skills:
low-level capabilities such as point-goal reaching and obstacle avoidance, and
high-level capabilities, such as route-visual alignment. To this end, we
propose UrbanVLA, a route-conditioned Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework
designed for scalable urban navigation. Our method explicitly aligns noisy
route waypoints with visual observations during execution, and subsequently
plans trajectories to drive the robot. To enable UrbanVLA to master both levels
of navigation, we employ a two-stage training pipeline. The process begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using simulated environments and trajectories
parsed from web videos. This is followed by Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) on
a mixture of simulation and real-world data, which enhances the model's safety
and adaptability in real-world settings. Experiments demonstrate that UrbanVLA
surpasses strong baselines by more than 55% in the SocialNav task on MetaUrban.
Furthermore, UrbanVLA achieves reliable real-world navigation, showcasing both
scalability to large-scale urban environments and robustness against real-world
uncertainties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监控方法无法有效连接技术基础设施指标与业务流程可见性，导致故障检测和分类困难。

Method: 通过计算连续ISO 20022消息交换的处理时间，构建系统状态的紧凑表示，并应用异常检测技术。

Result: 在TIPS系统上的实验表明，该方法能有效检测多种异常模式，并提供可解释的解释，显著减少调查时间。

Conclusion: 该方法填补了分布式系统中交易状态碎片化的可观测性空白，并能区分内部和外部支付系统问题。

Abstract: Instant payment infrastructures have stringent performance requirements,
processing millions of transactions daily with zero-downtime expectations.
Traditional monitoring approaches fail to bridge the gap between technical
infrastructure metrics and business process visibility. We introduce a novel
feature engineering approach based on processing times computed between
consecutive ISO 20022 message exchanges, creating a compact representation of
system state. By applying anomaly detection to these features, we enable early
failure detection and localization, allowing incident classification.
Experimental evaluation on the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS) system,
using both real-world incidents and controlled simulations, demonstrates the
approach's effectiveness in detecting diverse anomaly patterns and provides
inherently interpretable explanations that enable operators to understand the
business impact. By mapping features to distinct processing phases, the
resulting framework differentiates between internal and external payment system
issues, significantly reduces investigation time, and bridges observability
gaps in distributed systems where transaction state is fragmented across
multiple entities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低精度训练Transformer中前向误差放大的问题，提供理论支持和实用工具。

Method: 提出模块化理论，包括自注意力层的三个诊断指标、残差块的误差衰减理论，以及LayerNorm的稳定性指标。

Result: 在Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10上验证了理论的有效性，诊断指标能预测误差并指导稳定性优化。

Conclusion: 理论提供了可操作的诊断工具，能解释自注意力的脆弱性、预测不稳定性，并指导最小干预的优化。

Abstract: Transformers trained in low precision can suffer forward-error amplification.
We give a first-order, module-wise theory that predicts when and where errors
grow. For self-attention we derive a per-layer bound that factorizes into three
interpretable diagnostics: a score-scale ratio $\kappa_{\rm score}$, a rowwise
softmax sensitivity $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$, and value conditioning $\kappa(V)$.
We prove a residual relaxation inequality showing that residual blocks
attenuate depth-wise accumulation, and we introduce a precision- and
width-aware LayerNorm indicator $\rho_{\rm LN}$ with a matching first-order
bound in the $\epsilon$-dominated regime. These pieces yield a unified
forward-stability bound whose right-hand side is directly estimable during
training.
  On Tiny-ViT/CIFAR-10 we evaluate the bound and components. (1) The combined
predictor $\kappa_{\rm softmax},(1+\kappa_{\rm
score}),\kappa(V),|W_O|2+\kappa{\rm eff}+C_{\rm LN}$ tracks
FP32$\leftrightarrow$LP mismatches across seeds, widths, and precisions;
scaling by $\epsilon_{\rm mach}$ collapses mixed-precision points. (2) The
time-series maximum of $\kappa_{\rm softmax}$ acts as an early-warning signal,
leading error spikes by 16-24 steps (corr. 0.65-0.82; permutation
$p!\approx!10^{-3}$; Precision@K 0.89-1.00). (3) Guided by $\rho_{\rm LN}$, a
small LayerNorm-$\epsilon$ tweak targeting $\rho_\star$ gives consistent
stabilization (mean tail-loss $\downarrow\ \approx0.010$ at $\rho_\star!=!0.6$,
cap$=10^{-2}$) with negligible overhead.
  Overall, our theory supplies actionable, unitless diagnostics that (i)
explain when self-attention is fragile, (ii) forecast instability, and (iii)
motivate a minimally invasive mitigation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统训练方法可能导致模型层谱条件数过大，影响训练稳定性和性能。CMR旨在直接优化层谱，改善模型条件。

Method: CMR通过联合控制谱边缘（对数条件代理）和内部形状（切比雪夫矩），采用解耦、封顶的混合规则，保留任务梯度。

Result: 在对抗性设置中，CMR显著降低层条件数（约10^3倍），增加梯度幅度，并恢复测试准确率（从10%提升至86%）。

Conclusion: CMR证明了通过直接优化层谱可以改善模型条件，实现稳定且准确的学习。

Abstract: We introduce \textbf{Chebyshev Moment Regularization (CMR)}, a simple,
architecture-agnostic loss that directly optimizes layer spectra. CMR jointly
controls spectral edges via a log-condition proxy and shapes the interior via
Chebyshev moments, with a decoupled, capped mixing rule that preserves task
gradients. We prove strictly monotone descent for the condition proxy, bounded
moment gradients, and orthogonal invariance. In an adversarial
``$\kappa$-stress'' setting (MNIST, 15-layer MLP), \emph{compared to vanilla
training}, CMR reduces mean layer condition numbers by $\sim\!10^3$ (from
$\approx3.9\!\times\!10^3$ to $\approx3.4$ in 5 epochs), increases average
gradient magnitude, and restores test accuracy (
$\approx10\%\!\to\!\approx86\%$ ). These results support
\textbf{optimization-driven spectral preconditioning}: directly steering models
toward well-conditioned regimes for stable, accurate learning.

TL;DR: 开发机器学习模型预测术后误吸风险，识别关键影响因素如阿片类药物剂量和手术部位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术后误吸显著增加患者发病率和死亡率，需通过预测模型及时干预。

Method: 使用MIMIC-IV数据库，训练XGBoost、多层感知机和随机森林模型，并采用ATE分析因果关系。

Result: 模型AUROC为0.86，敏感性77.3%；阿片类药物剂量和手术部位是主要风险因素，男性误吸风险更高。

Conclusion: 机器学习可有效预测误吸风险，需关注阿片类药物使用和性别差异，优化术后护理策略。

Abstract: Background: Aspiration, the inhalation of foreign material into the lungs,
significantly impacts surgical patient morbidity and mortality. This study
develops a machine learning (ML) model to predict postoperative aspiration,
enabling timely preventative interventions.
  Methods: From the MIMIC-IV database of over 400,000 hospital admissions, we
identified 826 surgical patients (mean age: 62, 55.7\% male) who experienced
aspiration within seven days post-surgery, along with a matched non-aspiration
cohort. Three ML models: XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, and Random Forest were
trained using pre-surgical hospitalization data to predict postoperative
aspiration. To investigate causation, we estimated Average Treatment Effects
(ATE) using Augmented Inverse Probability Weighting.
  Results: Our ML model achieved an AUROC of 0.86 and 77.3\% sensitivity on a
held-out test set. Maximum daily opioid dose, length of stay, and patient age
emerged as the most important predictors. ATE analysis identified significant
causative factors: opioids (0.25 +/- 0.06) and operative site (neck: 0.20 +/-
0.13, head: 0.19 +/- 0.13). Despite equal surgery rates across genders, men
were 1.5 times more likely to aspirate and received 27\% higher maximum daily
opioid dosages compared to women.
  Conclusion: ML models can effectively predict postoperative aspiration risk,
enabling targeted preventative measures. Maximum daily opioid dosage and
operative site significantly influence aspiration risk. The gender disparity in
both opioid administration and aspiration rates warrants further investigation.
These findings have important implications for improving postoperative care
protocols and aspiration prevention strategies.

Result: 理论证明了在理想情况下的遗憾性质，并通过实验验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 新方法为多专家组合提供了无遗憾保证，提升了整体模型的性能。

Abstract: We explore the use of expert-guided bandit learning, which we refer to as
online mixture-of-experts (OMoE). In this setting, given a context, a candidate
committee of experts must determine how to aggregate their outputs to achieve
optimal results in terms of aggregate accuracy. We propose two algorithms to
address this problem. The first algorithm combines aggregate voting with
UCB-driven successive elimination, efficiently pruning suboptimal exploration
actions. The second algorithm employs an online weighted-majority-voting
mechanism, leveraging the respective voting power of each expert proportional
to their predictive power. We derive theoretical guarantees for the regret
properties in the bandit setting under ideal circumstances, and empirical
results are provided accordingly. As a modern study on applications, these
methods are applied to the online fine-tuning of a set of expert large language
models (LLMs), where after each response, the generative LLM dynamically
reweighs its set of experts and/or selects the optimal committee of experts to
generate the most accurate response. Our results introduce new methodologies
and no-regret guarantees for combining multiple experts to improve on the
performance of the an aggregate model overall.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中预测误差会累积，影响生成质量，需要一种无需调整模型的方法来减少误差。

Result: 实验表明VRG能显著提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Conclusion: VRG是一种有效且无需模型调整的误差减少方法，适用于多种生成任务。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become emerging generative models. Their sampling
process involves multiple steps, and in each step the models predict the noise
from a noisy sample. When the models make prediction, the output deviates from
the ground truth, and we call such a deviation as \textit{prediction error}.
The prediction error accumulates over the sampling process and deteriorates
generation quality. This paper introduces a novel technique for statistically
measuring the prediction error and proposes the Variance-Reduction Guidance
(VRG) method to mitigate this error. VRG does not require model fine-tuning or
modification. Given a predefined sampling trajectory, it searches for a new
trajectory which has the same number of sampling steps but produces higher
quality results. VRG is applicable to both conditional and unconditional
generation. Experiments on various datasets and baselines demonstrate that VRG
can significantly improve the generation quality of diffusion models. Source

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MJO是全球天气和气候极端事件的重要驱动因素，但其在动态模型中的预测仍具挑战性，通常仅能提前3-4周。

Method: 采用两阶段模型：首先使用物理信息3D U-Net修正时空场误差，然后通过优化的LSTM细化MJO的RMM指数。

Result: 在CMA、ECMWF和NCEP三种不同操作预测中，PCC-MJO将有效预测范围延长了2-8天，并显著缓解了“海洋大陆屏障”问题。

Conclusion: 该模型提供了一种物理一致、计算高效且高度通用的方法，突破了次季节预测中的长期障碍。

Abstract: The Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) is an important driver of global weather
and climate extremes, but its prediction in operational dynamical models
remains challenging, with skillful forecasts typically limited to 3-4 weeks.
Here, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, the Physics-guided Cascaded
Corrector for MJO (PCC-MJO), which acts as a universal post-processor to
correct MJO forecasts from dynamical models. This two-stage model first employs
a physics-informed 3D U-Net to correct spatial-temporal field errors, then
refines the MJO's RMM index using an LSTM optimized for forecast skill. When
applied to three different operational forecasts from CMA, ECMWF and NCEP, our
unified framework consistently extends the skillful forecast range (bivariate
correlation > 0.5) by 2-8 days. Crucially, the model effectively mitigates the
"Maritime Continent barrier", enabling more realistic eastward propagation and
amplitude. Explainable AI analysis quantitatively confirms that the model's
decision-making is spatially congruent with observed MJO dynamics (correlation
> 0.93), demonstrating that it learns physically meaningful features rather
than statistical fittings. Our work provides a promising physically consistent,
computationally efficient, and highly generalizable pathway to break through
longstanding barriers in subseasonal forecasting.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态不平衡问题，并验证了定量分析的重要性。

Abstract: Current mainstream approaches to addressing multimodal imbalance primarily
focus on architectural modifications and optimization-based, often overlooking
a quantitative analysis of the imbalance degree between modalities. To address
this gap, our work introduces a novel method for the quantitative analysis of
multi-modal imbalance, which in turn informs the design of a sample-level
adaptive loss function.We begin by defining the "Modality Gap" as the
difference between the Softmax scores of different modalities (e.g., audio and
visual) for the ground-truth class prediction. Analysis of the Modality Gap
distribution reveals that it can be effectively modeled by a bimodal Gaussian
Mixture Model (GMM). These two components are found to correspond respectively
to "modality-balanced" and "modality-imbalanced" data samples. Subsequently, we
apply Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior probability of each sample
belonging to these two distinct distributions.Informed by this quantitative
analysis, we design a novel adaptive loss function with three objectives: (1)
to minimize the overall Modality Gap; (2) to encourage the imbalanced sample
distribution to shift towards the balanced one; and (3) to apply greater
penalty weights to imbalanced samples. We employ a two-stage training strategy
consisting of a warm-up phase followed by an adaptive training
phase.Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the public CREMA-D and AVE datasets,
attaining accuracies of $80.65\%$ and $70.90\%$, respectively. This validates
the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.

Result: 理论证明MARS-M的收敛速度优于Muon，实验显示在语言建模和计算机视觉任务中表现更优。

Conclusion: MARS-M在理论和实践中均表现出色，适用于大规模神经网络训练。

Abstract: Matrix-based preconditioned optimizers, such as Muon, have recently been
shown to be more efficient than scalar-based optimizers for training
large-scale neural networks, including large language models (LLMs). On the
other hand, recent benchmarks on optimizers for LLM pre-training have
demonstrated that variance-reduction techniques such as MARS can achieve
substantial speedups over standard optimizers that do not employ variance
reduction. In this paper, to achieve the best of both worlds, we introduce
MARS-M, a new optimizer that integrates the variance reduction technique in
MARS with Muon. Under standard regularity conditions, we prove that Muon-M
converges to a first-order stationary point at a rate of
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, which improves upon
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$ rate attained by Muon. Our empirical results on
language modeling and computer vision tasks demonstrate that MARS-M
consistently yields lower losses and improved performance across various
downstream benchmarks. The implementation of MARS-M is available at

Abstract: Purely data-driven surrogates for fluid dynamics often fail catastrophically
from error accumulation, while existing hybrid methods have lacked the
automation and robustness for practical use. To solve this, we developed
XRePIT, a novel hybrid simulation strategy that synergizes machine learning
(ML) acceleration with solver-based correction. We specifically designed our
method to be fully automated and physics-aware, ensuring the stability and
practical applicability that previous approaches lacked. We demonstrate that
this new design overcomes long-standing barriers, achieving the first stable,
accelerated rollouts for over 10,000 timesteps. The method also generalizes
robustly to unseen boundary conditions and, crucially, scales to 3D flows. Our
approach delivers speedups up to 4.98$\times$ while maintaining high physical
fidelity, resolving thermal fields with relative errors of ~1E-3 and capturing
low magnitude velocity dynamics with errors below 1E-2 ms-1. This work thus
establishes a mature and scalable hybrid method, paving the way for its use in
real-world engineering.

Motivation: 解决机器学习模型因依赖地理位置特征而难以跨地区迁移的问题。

Method: 使用XGBoost分类器，基于热力学和辐射过程的坐标无关特征集进行训练和测试。

Result: 模型在多个地点（最远11,650公里）和不同雾况下AUC达0.923-0.947，SHAP分析显示模型学习了可迁移的物理关系。

Conclusion: 物理驱动的坐标无关特征工程可实现地理可迁移的大气预测工具。

Abstract: Short-term forecasting of airport fog (visibility < 1.0 km) presents
challenges in geographic generalization because many machine learning models
rely on location-specific features and fail to transfer across sites. This
study investigates whether fundamental thermodynamic and radiative processes
can be encoded in a coordinate-free (location-independent) feature set to
enable geographic transferability. A gradient boosting classifier (XGBoost)
trained on Santiago, Chile (SCEL, 33S) data from 2002-2009 was evaluated on a
2010-2012 holdout set and under strict zero-shot tests at Puerto Montt (SCTE),
San Francisco (KSFO), and London (EGLL). The model achieved AUC values of
0.923-0.947 across distances up to 11,650 km and different fog regimes
(radiative, advective, marine). Consistent SHAP feature rankings show that
visibility persistence, solar angle, and thermal gradients dominate
predictions, suggesting the model learned transferable physical relationships
rather than site-specific patterns. Results suggest that physics-informed,
coordinate-free feature engineering can yield geographically transferable
atmospheric forecasting tools.

Conclusion: HAIN在预测精度和可解释性之间取得平衡，推动了透明AI在精准医疗和合规性中的应用。

Abstract: The proliferation of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as genomics,
healthcare, and finance has created an urgent need for machine learning models
that are both highly accurate and inherently interpretable. While traditional
deep learning approaches deliver strong predictive performance, their lack of
transparency often impedes their deployment in critical, decision-sensitive
applications. In this work, we introduce the Hierarchical Attention-based
Interpretable Network (HAIN), a novel architecture that unifies multi-level
attention mechanisms, dimensionality reduction, and explanation-driven loss
functions to deliver interpretable and robust analysis of complex biomedical
data. HAIN provides feature-level interpretability via gradientweighted
attention and offers global model explanations through prototype-based
representations. Comprehensive evaluation on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset demonstrates that HAIN achieves a classification accuracy of 94.3%,
surpassing conventional post-hoc interpretability approaches such as SHAP and
LIME in both transparency and explanatory power. Furthermore, HAIN effectively
identifies biologically relevant cancer biomarkers, supporting its utility for
clinical and research applications. By harmonizing predictive accuracy with
interpretability, HAIN advances the development of transparent AI solutions for
precision medicine and regulatory compliance.

Motivation: 时间序列数据高维复杂，传统方法如DTW存在局限性，MDD通过多尺度评估和非点对点对齐提供更优解决方案。

Method: 采用Multiscale Dubuc Distance (MDD)方法，通过模拟和UCR档案中的95个数据集验证其性能。

Result: MDD在许多场景下显著优于DTW，并在实际分类任务中表现出明显改进。

Conclusion: MDD作为一种新型相似性度量方法，具有实际应用价值，尤其在复杂时间序列分析中表现突出。

Abstract: Time series are high-dimensional and complex data objects, making their
efficient search and indexing a longstanding challenge in data mining. Building
on a recently introduced similarity measure, namely Multiscale Dubuc Distance
(MDD), this paper investigates its comparative strengths and limitations
relative to the widely used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). MDD is novel in two key
ways: it evaluates time series similarity across multiple temporal scales and
avoids point-to-point alignment. We demonstrate that in many scenarios where
MDD outperforms DTW, the gains are substantial, and we provide a detailed
analysis of the specific performance gaps it addresses. We provide simulations,
in addition to the 95 datasets from the UCR archive, to test our hypotheses.
Finally, we apply both methods to a challenging real-world classification task
and show that MDD yields a significant improvement over DTW, underscoring its
practical utility.

TL;DR: GAPO是一种新的强化学习方法，用于处理代码编辑任务中奖励分布偏斜的问题，通过自适应地找到无异常值的高密度区间来改进优势估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的代码编辑任务常因奖励分布偏斜和异常值导致优势计算失真，现有方法如GRPO难以应对。

Method: GAPO通过自适应地找到每个提示的无异常值高密度区间，并使用该区间的中位数替代组均值来计算优势。

Result: 在51,844个真实代码编辑任务上验证，GAPO在9个LLM上均优于GRPO及其变体DAPO。

Conclusion: GAPO是一种高效且即插即用的方法，能有效处理奖励分布偏斜问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is widely used for post-training large language
models (LLMs) in code editing, where group-relative methods like GRPO are
popular for their critic-free, normalized advantage estimation. However, in
real-world code-editing scenarios, reward distributions are often skewed with
unpredictable outliers, leading to distorted advantage computation and
increased noise. To address this issue, we propose Group Adaptive Policy
Optimization (GAPO), which adaptively finds an outlier-free highest-density
interval (HDI) per prompt and then uses the median of that interval as an
adaptive Q to replace the group mean in advantage calculation. This adaptive Q
robustly handles skewed distributions while remaining plug-and-play and
efficient. We validate GAPO on nine instruction-tuned LLMs (3B-14B) using a
large internal dataset of 51,844 real-world, history-aware code-editing tasks
across 10 languages, demonstrating consistent improvements in exact match
accuracy over GRPO and its variant DAPO. Code is publicly available.

TL;DR: RestoreLCC是一种针对剪枝后大语言模型的性能恢复方法，通过选择性补偿丢失的注意力激活信息，显著提升模型性能，同时保持稀疏性和推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）通常针对密集模型设计，忽视了剪枝模型的特性，导致恢复效果不佳。因此，需要一种专门针对剪枝模型的性能恢复策略。

Method: 提出RestoreLCC方法，通过对比性探测关键注意力头、提取丢失的激活信息，并将其重新注入剪枝后的注意力头中，实现性能补偿。

Result: 实验表明，RestoreLCC在通用和任务特定性能恢复上均优于现有基线方法，且不损害模型的稀疏性或推理效率。

Conclusion: RestoreLCC是一种即插即用的高效性能恢复方法，适用于多种剪枝方案，为剪枝模型的实用化提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pruning is a widely used technique to reduce the size and inference cost of
large language models (LLMs), but it often causes performance degradation. To
mitigate this, existing restoration methods typically employ
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), such as LoRA, to recover the pruned
model's performance. However, most PEFT methods are designed for dense models
and overlook the distinct properties of pruned models, often resulting in
suboptimal recovery. In this work, we propose a targeted restoration strategy
for pruned models that restores performance while preserving their low cost and
high efficiency. We observe that pruning-induced information loss is reflected
in attention activations, and selectively reintroducing components of this
information can significantly recover model performance. Based on this insight,
we introduce RestoreLCC (Restoring Pruned LLMs via Lost Component
Compensation), a plug-and-play method that contrastively probes critical
attention heads via activation editing, extracts lost components from
activation differences, and finally injects them back into the corresponding
pruned heads for compensation and recovery. RestoreLCC is compatible with
structured, semi-structured, and unstructured pruning schemes. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that RestoreLCC consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both general and task-specific performance
recovery, without compromising the sparsity or inference efficiency of pruned
models.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉语言模型在生成商品描述时的事实性幻觉问题，并提升多任务效率。

Method: 采用多任务学习微调视觉编码器，并结合层次化生成过程，将预测属性嵌入提示中以生成文本。

Result: 多任务方法在价格回归和属性分类上分别提升3.6%和6.6%，层次化生成减少44.5%的幻觉率，并降低3.5倍延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法在减少幻觉和提升效率方面表现优异，尽管在ROUGE-L得分上略逊于直接视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Manually generating catchy descriptions and names is labor intensive and a
slow process for retailers. Although generative AI provides an automation
solution in form of Vision to Language Models (VLM), the current VLMs are prone
to factual "hallucinations". Siloed, single task models are not only
inefficient but also fail to capture interdependent relationships between
features. To address these challenges, we propose an end to end, multi task
system that generates factually grounded textual listings from a single image.
The contributions of this study are two proposals for the model architecture.
First, application of multi task learning approach for fine tuning a vision
encoder where a single vision backbone is jointly trained on attribute
prediction such as color, hemline and neck style and price regression. Second,
introduction of a hierarchical generation process where the model's own
predicted attributes are embedded in a prompt and fed to the text decoder to
improve factual consistency. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of
this architecture. The multi tasking approach outperforms both the independent
price regression, with a 3.6% better R2 Value and attribute classification,
with a 6.6% improvement F1 score. Critically, the hierarchical generation
process proves highly effective, slashing the factual hallucination rate from
12.7% to 7.1%, a 44.5% relative reduction, compared to a non hierarchical
ablation. The hierarchical approach also reduces the latency of the
autoregressive text generation process by a factor of 3.5 when compared to
direct vision to language model of similar size. One minor caveat is that the
model does perform 3.5% worse than direct vision-to-language model on ROUGE-L
score.

Result: 在多个数据集上克服了灾难性遗忘，减少了参数使用和内存占用，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COLA框架为持续学习提供了一种高效、低资源消耗的解决方案。

Abstract: Learning a set of tasks over time, also known as continual learning (CL), is
one of the most challenging problems in artificial intelligence due to
catastrophic forgetting. Large language models (LLMs) are often impractical to
frequent re-training and continual learning , due to high cost of computational
resources for training. Moreover, LLM are not suitable for continual learning
as updating these models over time for acquiring new knowledge leads to
overwrites existing knowledge leading to common phenomenon know as
\textit{catastrophic forgetting}. In this paper, we aim to address these
concerns using a novel framework , COLA that employs an autoencoder to learn
capture low-dimensional embeddings of the weights associated with various
tasks. Our approach facilitates the transfer of knowledge to new tasks while
preventing catastrophic forgetting, all without using data replay or a
substantial set of task-specific parameters. Our approach, COLA, makes the LLM
efficiently learn new tasks with minimal training, insignificant performance
degradation on previous tasks, and eliminates the need for retaining earlier
training data. Empirical evaluation on different datasets ranging from task
oriented dialouge system to intent classsfication datasets showcases that our
method not only overcomes catastrophic forgetting but also achieves significant
reduction in parameter usage and memory size, across multiple tasks and
outperforming the existing state of the art methods across multiple datasets.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）的高计算和环境成本限制了其可访问性，现有压缩方法忽略了层间复杂相关性。

Method: 使用无限投影纠缠对态（iPEPS）和张量重整化群（TRG）技术捕捉多方向纠缠并进行多项式时间压缩。

Result: 在LLaMA-2 7B上实现93%内存和70%参数减少，训练速度提升50%，推理速度提升25%，精度损失仅2-3%。

Conclusion: KARIPAP证明LLMs占据低维纠缠流形，为可扩展、高效和量子感知的AI架构提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and LLaMA drive rapid progress in
generative AI, yet their huge parameter scales create severe computational and
environmental burdens. High training costs, energy use, and limited device
deployment hinder accessibility. Existing compression - pruning, distillation,
low-rank, and quantization - reduces size but ignores complex inter-layer
correlations. We propose KARIPAP, a quantum-inspired tensor network compression
using Infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) and Tensor
Renormalization Group (TRG) contraction. Unlike 1D Matrix Product States, iPEPS
captures multi-directional entanglement in attention and deep transformer
layers. TRG ensures polynomial-time contraction, making tensorization feasible
while preserving key correlation geometry. Experiments on LLaMA-2 7B show up to
93% memory and 70% parameter reduction, with 50% faster training, 25% faster
inference, and only 2-3% accuracy loss. Layer-wise entanglement profiling
reveals redundancy in deeper layers, confirming their suitability for tensor
factorization. KARIPAP demonstrates that modern LLMs occupy low-dimensional
entanglement manifolds, enabling scalable, energy-efficient, and quantum-aware
AI architectures.

depend on shadow models or heavy query access, which limits their practicality.
We propose GP-MIA, an efficient and interpretable approach based on Gaussian

dataset statistics, and optional sensitivity features (e.g. gradients, NTK
measures) from a single trained model, GP-MIA trains a GP classifier to
distinguish members from non-members while providing calibrated uncertainty
estimates. Experiments on synthetic data, real-world fraud detection data,
CIFAR-10, and WikiText-2 show that GP-MIA achieves high accuracy and
generalizability, offering a practical alternative to existing MIAs.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于偏好优化的降水临近预报方法SynCast，通过两阶段训练框架Diffusion-SPO，解决确定性模型和概率生成模型的局限性，并协同优化冲突的评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 降水临近预报在极端天气监测和灾害预防中至关重要，但现有深度学习方法存在局限性，如确定性模型的预测过于平滑，概率生成模型的性能波动大，且评估指标之间存在冲突。

Method: 提出SynCast方法，采用Diffusion-SPO两阶段后训练框架：第一阶段降低FAR，抑制误报；第二阶段在保持FAR的基础上优化CSI，实现指标的协同改进。

Result: 该方法能够协同优化冲突的评估指标（如CSI和FAR），并实现一致的性能提升。

Conclusion: 通过偏好优化和两阶段训练框架，SynCast在降水临近预报中有效解决了现有模型的局限性，并实现了评估指标的协同优化。

Abstract: Precipitation nowcasting based on radar echoes plays a crucial role in
monitoring extreme weather and supporting disaster prevention. Although deep
learning approaches have achieved significant progress, they still face notable
limitations. For example, deterministic models tend to produce over-smoothed
predictions, which struggle to capture extreme events and fine-scale
precipitation patterns. Probabilistic generative models, due to their inherent
randomness, often show fluctuating performance across different metrics and
rarely achieve consistently optimal results. Furthermore, precipitation
nowcasting is typically evaluated using multiple metrics, some of which are
inherently conflicting. For instance, there is often a trade-off between the
Critical Success Index (CSI) and the False Alarm Ratio (FAR), making it
challenging for existing models to deliver forecasts that perform well on both
metrics simultaneously. To address these challenges, we introduce preference
optimization into precipitation nowcasting for the first time, motivated by the
success of reinforcement learning from human feedback in large language models.
Specifically, we propose SynCast, a method that employs the two-stage
post-training framework of Diffusion Sequential Preference Optimization
(Diffusion-SPO), to progressively align conflicting metrics and consistently
achieve superior performance. In the first stage, the framework focuses on
reducing FAR, training the model to effectively suppress false alarms. Building
on this foundation, the second stage further optimizes CSI with constraints
that preserve FAR alignment, thereby achieving synergistic improvements across
these conflicting metrics.

Conclusion: 多语言视觉语言训练数据显著提升跨语言泛化能力，指令调优的LLM并非总是最佳初始化选择，所有模型、数据和训练方法已公开。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in vision-language models (VLMs), most existing
work follows an English-centric design process, limiting their effectiveness in
multilingual settings. In this work, we provide a comprehensive empirical study
analyzing the impact of several multilingual design choices, such as training
data composition, encoder selection, and text backbones. The result is
TowerVision, a family of open multilingual VLMs for both image-text and
video-text tasks, built upon the multilingual text-only model Tower+.
TowerVision achieves competitive performance on multiple multimodal
multilingual benchmarks and shows particular strength in culturally grounded
tasks and multimodal translation. By incorporating visual and cultural context
during fine-tuning, our models surpass existing approaches trained on
substantially larger datasets, as demonstrated on ALM-Bench and Multi30K (image
tasks) and ViMUL-Bench (video tasks). Alongside the models, we release
VisionBlocks, a high-quality, curated vision-language dataset. Our findings
highlight that multilingual vision-language training data substantially
improves cross-lingual generalization -- both from high-resource to
underrepresented languages and vice versa -- and that instruction-tuned LLMs
are not always the optimal initialization point. To support further research,
we publicly release all models, data, and training recipes.

Conclusion: DEIM不仅可作为模型降维工具，还可作为诊断框架，帮助理解和改进神经微分方程模型的泛化行为。

Abstract: We present a differentiable framework that leverages the Discrete Empirical
Interpolation Method (DEIM) for interpretable deep learning and dynamical
system analysis. Although DEIM efficiently approximates nonlinear terms in
projection-based reduced-order models (POD-ROM), its fixed interpolation points
limit the adaptability to complex and time-varying dynamics. To address this
limitation, we first develop a differentiable adaptive DEIM formulation for the
one-dimensional viscous Burgers equation, which allows neural networks to
dynamically select interpolation points in a computationally efficient and
physically consistent manner. We then apply DEIM as an interpretable analysis
tool for examining the learned dynamics of a pre-trained Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (NODE) on a two-dimensional vortex-merging problem. The
DEIM trajectories reveal physically meaningful features in the learned dynamics
of NODE and expose its limitations when extrapolating to unseen flow
configurations. These findings demonstrate that DEIM can serve not only as a
model reduction tool but also as a diagnostic framework for understanding and
improving the generalization behavior of neural differential equation models.

Result: 理论分析和实际案例表明，该框架在保护隐私的同时，平均日调度成本低于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的隐私保护DFL框架有效解决了MES中的隐私与决策优化问题。

Abstract: Decision-making for multi-energy system (MES) dispatch depends on accurate
load forecasting. Traditionally, load forecasting and decision-making for MES
are implemented separately. Forecasting models are typically trained to
minimize forecasting errors, overlooking their impact on downstream
decision-making. To address this, decision-focused learning (DFL) has been
studied to minimize decision-making costs instead. However, practical adoption
of DFL in MES faces significant challenges: the process requires sharing
sensitive load data and model parameters across multiple sectors, raising
serious privacy issues. To this end, we propose a privacy-preserving DFL
framework tailored for MES. Our approach introduces information masking to
safeguard private data while enabling recovery of decision variables and
gradients required for model training. To further enhance security for DFL, we
design a safety protocol combining matrix decomposition and homomorphic
encryption, effectively preventing collusion and unauthorized data access.
Additionally, we developed a privacy-preserving load pattern recognition
algorithm, enabling the training of specialized DFL models for heterogeneous
load patterns. Theoretical analysis and comprehensive case studies, including
real-world MES data, demonstrate that our framework not only protects privacy
but also consistently achieves lower average daily dispatch costs compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: With the remarkable success of deep learning, applying such techniques to EM
methods has emerged as a promising research direction to overcome the
limitations of conventional approaches. The effectiveness of deep learning
methods depends heavily on the quality of datasets, which directly influences
model performance and generalization ability. Existing application studies
often construct datasets from random one-dimensional or structurally simple
three-dimensional models, which fail to represent the complexity of real
geological environments. Furthermore, the absence of standardized, publicly
available three-dimensional geoelectric datasets continues to hinder progress
in deep learning based EM exploration. To address these limitations, we present
OpenEM, a large scale, multi structural three dimensional geoelectric dataset
that encompasses a broad range of geologically plausible subsurface structures.
OpenEM consists of nine categories of geoelectric models, spanning from simple
configurations with anomalous bodies in half space to more complex structures
such as flat layers, folded layers, flat faults, curved faults, and their
corresponding variants with anomalous bodies. Since three-dimensional forward
modeling in electromagnetics is extremely time-consuming, we further developed
a deep learning based fast forward modeling approach for OpenEM, enabling
efficient and reliable forward modeling across the entire dataset. This
capability allows OpenEM to be rapidly deployed for a wide range of tasks.
OpenEM provides a unified, comprehensive, and large-scale dataset for common EM
exploration systems to accelerate the application of deep learning in
electromagnetic methods. The complete dataset, along with the forward modeling
codes and trained models, is publicly available at

Conclusion: 递归推理存在结构性限制，需外部信息交换以避免信息封闭；最小干预可作为设计合作推理系统的原则。

Abstract: Large language models are often described as capable of reflective reasoning,
yet recursive self-evaluation without external feedback frequently yields
reformulation rather than progress. We test this prediction in a cross-provider
study of 144 reasoning sequences across three models (OpenAI GPT-4o-mini,
Anthropic Claude 3 Haiku, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash) and four task families
(arithmetic, code, explanation, reflection), each iterated ten times under two
conditions: ungrounded self-critique and a minimal grounding intervention (a
single verification step at iteration three). Mean informational change (delta
I, measured via normalized edit distance) declined by 55% from early (0.193) to
late (0.087) iterations in ungrounded runs, with consistent patterns across all
three providers. Grounded runs showed a +28% rebound in informational change
immediately after the intervention and sustained non-zero variance thereafter.
Complementary measures-n-gram novelty, embedding drift, and character-level
entropy-converged on the same pattern: reflection without contact tends toward
informational closure. We interpret this as evidence for a structural limit on
self-correction in generative reasoning: without an exchange of information
with an independent verifier or environment, recursive inference approaches an
attractor state of epistemic stasis. Minimal grounding functions as dissipative
coupling, reintroducing informational flux. The cross-architecture consistency
suggests the mirror loop arises from shared autoregressive training objectives
rather than provider-specific alignment schemes. The results delineate when
reflection is performative rather than epistemic and motivate design principles
for grounded, cooperative reasoning. Materials and code are publicly available.

Abstract: This monograph presents the core principles that have guided the development
of diffusion models, tracing their origins and showing how diverse formulations
arise from shared mathematical ideas. Diffusion modeling starts by defining a
forward process that gradually corrupts data into noise, linking the data
distribution to a simple prior through a continuum of intermediate
distributions. The goal is to learn a reverse process that transforms noise
back into data while recovering the same intermediates. We describe three
complementary views. The variational view, inspired by variational
autoencoders, sees diffusion as learning to remove noise step by step. The
score-based view, rooted in energy-based modeling, learns the gradient of the
evolving data distribution, indicating how to nudge samples toward more likely
regions. The flow-based view, related to normalizing flows, treats generation
as following a smooth path that moves samples from noise to data under a
learned velocity field. These perspectives share a common backbone: a
time-dependent velocity field whose flow transports a simple prior to the data.
Sampling then amounts to solving a differential equation that evolves noise
into data along a continuous trajectory. On this foundation, the monograph
discusses guidance for controllable generation, efficient numerical solvers,
and diffusion-motivated flow-map models that learn direct mappings between
arbitrary times. It provides a conceptual and mathematically grounded
understanding of diffusion models for readers with basic deep-learning
knowledge.

machine learning. The method proposed in this work consists of a hybrid linear
feature extraction scheme to be used in supervised multi-class classification
problems. Inspired by two recent linear discriminant methods: robust sparse
linear discriminant analysis (RSLDA) and inter-class sparsitybased
discriminative least square regression (ICS_DLSR), we propose a unifying
criterion that is able to retain the advantages of these two powerful methods.
The resulting transformation relies on sparsity-promoting techniques both to
select the features that most accurately represent the data and to preserve the
row-sparsity consistency property of samples from the same class. The linear
transformation and the orthogonal matrix are estimated using an iterative
alternating minimization scheme based on steepest descent gradient method and
different initialization schemes. The proposed framework is generic in the
sense that it allows the combination and tuning of other linear discriminant
embedding methods. According to the experiments conducted on several datasets
including faces, objects, and digits, the proposed method was able to
outperform competing methods in most cases.

Motivation: 现有对抗训练方法难以应对新出现的越狱攻击，因此需要一种更有效的方法来提升模型的安全性。

Method: 通过分析32篇攻击论文，提取并压缩对抗技能为稀疏字典，提出Adversarial Skill Compositional Training（ASCoT）方法。

Result: ASCoT显著提升对未知攻击（包括多轮越狱）的鲁棒性，同时保持低拒绝率。

Conclusion: 扩展对抗技能覆盖范围而非仅增加数据规模，是防御新攻击的关键。

Abstract: Large language models remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks that bypass
safety guardrails to elicit harmful outputs. Defending against novel jailbreaks
represents a critical challenge in AI safety. Adversarial training -- designed
to make models robust against worst-case perturbations -- has been the dominant
paradigm for adversarial robustness. However, due to optimization challenges
and difficulties in defining realistic threat models, adversarial training
methods often fail on newly developed jailbreaks in practice. This paper
proposes a new paradigm for improving robustness against unseen jailbreaks,
centered on the Adversarial D\'ej\`a Vu hypothesis: novel jailbreaks are not
fundamentally new, but largely recombinations of adversarial skills from
previous attacks. We study this hypothesis through a large-scale analysis of 32
attack papers published over two years. Using an automated pipeline, we extract
and compress adversarial skills into a sparse dictionary of primitives, with
LLMs generating human-readable descriptions. Our analysis reveals that unseen
attacks can be effectively explained as sparse compositions of earlier skills,
with explanatory power increasing monotonically as skill coverage grows. Guided
by this insight, we introduce Adversarial Skill Compositional Training (ASCoT),
which trains on diverse compositions of skill primitives rather than isolated
attack instances. ASCoT substantially improves robustness to unseen attacks,
including multi-turn jailbreaks, while maintaining low over-refusal rates. We
also demonstrate that expanding adversarial skill coverage, not just data
scale, is key to defending against novel attacks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合整数规划框架，优化医疗风险评分工具中的权重和阈值，解决部分监督和不对称误分类成本问题。

Motivation: 电子健康记录数据为优化风险评分工具提供了机会，但部分监督和不对称误分类成本限制了标准监督学习的应用。

Result: 框架支持治理约束，确保在临床工作流程中的实际可部署性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了医疗风险评分工具优化中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring
systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While
electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven
optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard
supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored
outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2)
asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We
propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes
scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach
handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets,
incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category
collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using
softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient
optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign
restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring
practical deployability in clinical workflows.

Conclusion: AutoSciDACT为科学发现提供了一种统计严谨的新颖性检测方法。

Abstract: Novelty detection in large scientific datasets faces two key challenges: the
noisy and high-dimensional nature of experimental data, and the necessity of
making statistically robust statements about any observed outliers. While there
is a wealth of literature on anomaly detection via dimensionality reduction,
most methods do not produce outputs compatible with quantifiable claims of
scientific discovery. In this work we directly address these challenges,
presenting the first step towards a unified pipeline for novelty detection
adapted for the rigorous statistical demands of science. We introduce
AutoSciDACT (Automated Scientific Discovery with Anomalous Contrastive
Testing), a general-purpose pipeline for detecting novelty in scientific data.
AutoSciDACT begins by creating expressive low-dimensional data representations
using a contrastive pre-training, leveraging the abundance of high-quality
simulated data in many scientific domains alongside expertise that can guide
principled data augmentation strategies. These compact embeddings then enable
an extremely sensitive machine learning-based two-sample test using the New
Physics Learning Machine (NPLM) framework, which identifies and statistically
quantifies deviations in observed data relative to a reference distribution
(null hypothesis). We perform experiments across a range of astronomical,
physical, biological, image, and synthetic datasets, demonstrating strong
sensitivity to small injections of anomalous data across all domains.

Conclusion: 低秩结构能有效提升泛化性能，且Schatten $p$准范数越小，效果越显著。

Abstract: It has been recently observed in much of the literature that neural networks
exhibit a bottleneck rank property: for larger depths, the activation and
weights of neural networks trained with gradient-based methods tend to be of
approximately low rank. In fact, the rank of the activations of each layer
converges to a fixed value referred to as the ``bottleneck rank'', which is the
minimum rank required to represent the training data. This perspective is in
line with the observation that regularizing linear networks (without
activations) with weight decay is equivalent to minimizing the Schatten $p$
quasi norm of the neural network. In this paper we investigate the implications
of this phenomenon for generalization. More specifically, we prove
generalization bounds for neural networks which exploit the approximate low
rank structure of the weight matrices if present. The final results rely on the
Schatten $p$ quasi norms of the weight matrices: for small $p$, the bounds
exhibit a sample complexity $ \widetilde{O}(WrL^2)$ where $W$ and $L$ are the
width and depth of the neural network respectively and where $r$ is the rank of
the weight matrices. As $p$ increases, the bound behaves more like a norm-based
bound instead.

Abstract: Spectral decomposition of linear operators plays a central role in many areas
of machine learning and scientific computing. Recent work has explored training
neural networks to approximate eigenfunctions of such operators, enabling
scalable approaches to representation learning, dynamical systems, and partial
differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we revisit a classical
optimization framework from the computational physics literature known as the
\emph{orbital minimization method} (OMM), originally proposed in the 1990s for
solving eigenvalue problems in computational chemistry. We provide a simple
linear-algebraic proof of the consistency of the OMM objective, and reveal
connections between this method and several ideas that have appeared
independently across different domains. Our primary goal is to justify its
broader applicability in modern learning pipelines. We adapt this framework to
train neural networks to decompose positive semidefinite operators, and
demonstrate its practical advantages across a range of benchmark tasks. Our
results highlight how revisiting classical numerical methods through the lens
of modern theory and computation can provide not only a principled approach for
deploying neural networks in numerical simulation, but also effective and
scalable tools for machine learning.

Motivation: Transformer的成功使其运行时改进成为研究热点，但现有的线性注意力机制在实践中效率未达理论预期。

Method: 提出了一种新的线性注意力前向和反向传播方法，并开发了高度优化的CUDA实现。

Result: 方法在速度上比现有技术快3.3倍，内存消耗减少3.6倍，并在14亿参数语言模型上验证了其表达能力。

Conclusion: 新方法在保持表达能力的同时，显著提升了线性注意力的效率和实用性。

Abstract: The original softmax-based attention mechanism (regular attention) in the
extremely successful Transformer architecture computes attention between $N$
tokens, each embedded in a $D$-dimensional head, with a time complexity of
$O(N^2D)$. Given the success of Transformers, improving their runtime during
both training and inference is a popular research area. One such approach is
the introduction of the linear attention (LA) mechanisms, which offers a linear
time complexity of $O(ND^2)$ and have demonstrated comparable accuracy to
regular attention. However, LA in practice lags behind its theoretical
efficiency. We propose a novel method for LA's forward and backward passes,
along with a highly-optimized CUDA implementation. Our approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by 3.3 times in speed and reduces memory consumption by 3.6
times. We validate these improvements in both single-layer and end-to-end
settings by training a 1.4 billion parameter language model, which demonstrates
similar expressivity to regular attention on major reasoning benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决并行采样中条件独立性和高置信度预测之间的冲突，以提高离散文本生成的效率和准确性。

Method: 通过近似条件独立性测试，识别令牌依赖关系并移除低置信度令牌，生成满足独立性和置信度标准的解掩码索引集。

Result: 在IFEval基准测试中，PUNT比基线方法（包括顺序生成）的准确率提高了16%，且在生成长序列时表现更优。

Conclusion: PUNT不仅提高了生成效率和准确性，还展现出类似规划的层次化生成策略，有助于强对齐性能。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) offer a compelling alternative to
autoregressive models (ARMs) for discrete text generation because they enable
parallel token sampling, rather than sequential, left-to-right generation. This
means potentially much faster inference. However, effective parallel sampling
faces two competing requirements: (i) simultaneously updated tokens must be
conditionally independent, and (ii) updates should prioritise high-confidence
predictions. These goals conflict because high-confidence predictions often
cluster and depend on each other, opportunities for parallel updates.
  We present PUNT, a model-agnostic sampler that reconciles this trade-off. Our
method identifies token dependencies and removes lower-confidence tokens from
conflicting groups. This produces sets of indices for unmasking that satisfy
both independence and confidence criteria. Our approach ensures improved
parallel unmasking through approximate conditional independence testing.
  Our experiments show that PUNT delivers a superior trade-off between accuracy
and compute when compared to other strong training-free baselines, especially
for generation of longer sequences. On the IFEval benchmark, it achieves up to
16\% higher accuracy over baseline methods, including sequential generation
(one-by-one). These gains hold across different values of hyperparameters,
mitigating the need for brittle hyperparameter tuning. Moreover, we observe
that PUNT induces an emergent hierarchical generation strategy, where the model
first establishes high-level paragraph structure before local refinement,
suggesting a planning-like generation process that contributes to strong
alignment performance.

Result: 在合成和基准数据集上的实验表明，DJGP 在预测准确性和不确定性量化方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DJGP 通过结合局部子空间结构和双层学习框架，显著提升了高维分段连续函数建模的性能。

Abstract: We introduce Deep Jump Gaussian Processes (DJGP), a novel method for
surrogate modeling of high-dimensional piecewise continuous functions. DJGP
overcomes the limitations of conventional Jump Gaussian Processes in
high-dimensional input spaces by adding a locally linear projection layer to
Jump Gaussian Processes. This projection uses region-specific matrices to
capture local subspace structures, naturally complementing the localized nature
of JGP, a variant of local Gaussian Processes. To control model complexity, we
place a Gaussian Process prior on the projection matrices, allowing them to
evolve smoothly across the input space. The projected inputs are then modeled
with a JGP to capture piecewise continuous relationships with the response.
This yields a distinctive two-layer deep learning of GP/JGP. We further develop
a scalable variational inference algorithm to jointly learn the projection
matrices and JGP hyperparameters. Experiments on synthetic and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that DJGP delivers superior predictive accuracy and more
reliable uncertainty quantification compared to existing approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR训练可能导致模型在长时间训练后遗忘基础技能，如感知和忠实性。现有方法如KL散度正则化无法保证广泛知识的保留，且跨领域经验回放难以平衡目标权重。

Method: 提出RECAP策略，通过动态调整目标权重，利用收敛和不稳定的短期信号，将训练重点从饱和目标转向表现不佳或不稳定的目标。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-VL-3B和Qwen2.5-VL-7B上的实验表明，RECAP不仅保留了模型的通用能力，还通过灵活权衡任务内奖励提升了推理能力。

Conclusion: RECAP是一种端到端方法，无需额外模型或复杂调参，即可有效解决RLVR训练中的能力退化问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has delivered
impressive gains in mathematical and multimodal reasoning and has become a
standard post-training paradigm for contemporary language and vision-language
models. However, the RLVR recipe introduces a significant risk of capability
regression, where models forget foundational skills after prolonged training
without employing regularization strategies. We empirically confirm this
concern, observing that open-source reasoning models suffer performance
degradation on core capabilities such as perception and faithfulness. While
imposing regularization terms like KL divergence can help prevent deviation
from the base model, these terms are calculated on the current task, thus they
do not guarantee broader knowledge. Meanwhile, commonly used experience replay
across heterogeneous domains makes it nontrivial to decide how much training
focus each objective should receive. To address this, we propose RECAP-a replay
strategy with dynamic objective reweighting for general knowledge preservation.
Our reweighting mechanism adapts in an online manner using short-horizon
signals of convergence and instability, shifting the post-training focus away
from saturated objectives and toward underperforming or volatile ones. Our
method is end-to-end and readily applicable to existing RLVR pipelines without
training additional models or heavy tuning. Extensive experiments on benchmarks
based on Qwen2.5-VL-3B and Qwen2.5-VL-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, which not only preserves general capabilities but also improves
reasoning by enabling more flexible trade-offs among in-task rewards.

Abstract: Machine-learning methods in biochemistry commonly represent molecules as
graphs of pairwise intermolecular interactions for property and structure
predictions. Most methods operate on a single graph, typically the minimal free
energy (MFE) structure, for low-energy ensembles (conformations) representative
of structures at thermodynamic equilibrium. We introduce a thermodynamically
parameterized exponential-family random graph (ERGM) embedding that models
molecules as Boltzmann-weighted ensembles of interaction graphs. We evaluate
this embedding on SELEX datasets, where experimental biases (e.g., PCR
amplification or sequencing noise) can obscure true aptamer-ligand affinity,
producing anomalous candidates whose observed abundance diverges from their
actual binding strength. We show that the proposed embedding enables robust
community detection and subgraph-level explanations for aptamer ligand
affinity, even in the presence of biased observations. This approach may be
used to identify low-abundance aptamer candidates for further experimental
evaluation.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) promises to solve long-horizon tasks even when
training data contains only short fragments of the behaviors. This experience
stitching capability is often viewed as the purview of temporal difference (TD)
methods. However, outside of small tabular settings, trajectories never
intersect, calling into question this conventional wisdom. Moreover, the common
belief is that Monte Carlo (MC) methods should not be able to recombine
experience, yet it remains unclear whether function approximation could result
in a form of implicit stitching. The goal of this paper is to empirically study
whether the conventional wisdom about stitching actually holds in settings
where function approximation is used. We empirically demonstrate that Monte
Carlo (MC) methods can also achieve experience stitching. While TD methods do
achieve slightly stronger capabilities than MC methods (in line with
conventional wisdom), that gap is significantly smaller than the gap between
small and large neural networks (even on quite simple tasks). We find that
increasing critic capacity effectively reduces the generalization gap for both
the MC and TD methods. These results suggest that the traditional TD inductive
bias for stitching may be less necessary in the era of large models for RL and,
in some cases, may offer diminishing returns. Additionally, our results suggest
that stitching, a form of generalization unique to the RL setting, might be
achieved not through specialized algorithms (temporal difference learning) but
rather through the same recipe that has provided generalization in other
machine learning settings (via scale). Project website:

Conclusion: 因果可解释性与预测准确性存在权衡，新框架为设计可解释模型提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: Understanding the predictions made by deep learning models remains a central
challenge, especially in high-stakes applications. A promising approach is to
equip models with the ability to answer counterfactual questions --
hypothetical ``what if?'' scenarios that go beyond the observed data and
provide insight into a model reasoning. In this work, we introduce the notion
of causal interpretability, which formalizes when counterfactual queries can be
evaluated from a specific class of models and observational data. We analyze
two common model classes -- blackbox and concept-based predictors -- and show
that neither is causally interpretable in general. To address this gap, we
develop a framework for building models that are causally interpretable by
design. Specifically, we derive a complete graphical criterion that determines
whether a given model architecture supports a given counterfactual query. This
leads to a fundamental tradeoff between causal interpretability and predictive
accuracy, which we characterize by identifying the unique maximal set of
features that yields an interpretable model with maximal predictive
expressiveness. Experiments corroborate the theoretical findings.

Abstract: Text watermarking plays a crucial role in ensuring the traceability and
accountability of large language model (LLM) outputs and mitigating misuse.
While promising, most existing methods assume perfect pseudorandomness. In
practice, repetition in generated text induces collisions that create
structured dependence, compromising Type I error control and invalidating
standard analyses.
  We introduce a statistical framework that captures this structure through a
hierarchical two-layer partition. At its core is the concept of minimal units
-- the smallest groups treatable as independent across units while permitting
dependence within. Using minimal units, we define a non-asymptotic efficiency
measure and cast watermark detection as a minimax hypothesis testing problem.
  Applied to Gumbel-max and inverse-transform watermarks, our framework
produces closed-form optimal rules. It explains why discarding repeated
statistics often improves performance and shows that within-unit dependence
must be addressed unless degenerate. Both theory and experiments confirm
improved detection power with rigorous Type I error control. These results
provide the first principled foundation for watermark detection under imperfect
pseudorandomness, offering both theoretical insight and practical guidance for
reliable tracing of model outputs.

contextual amino acid patterns (ESM-2: Evolutionary Scale Modeling), and
sequence-based n-gram statistics (ProtVec]). AlphaFold2 protein structures are
available through public databases (e.g., AlphaFold2 Protein Structure
Database), but the internal neural network embeddings are not. DPEB addresses
this gap by providing AlphaFold2-derived embeddings for computational modeling.
Our benchmark evaluations show GraphSAGE with BioEmbedding achieved the highest

achieved 77.42% accuracy for enzyme classification and 86.04% accuracy for
protein family classification. DPEB supports multiple graph neural network
methods for PPI prediction, enabling applications in systems biology, drug
target identification, pathway analysis, and disease mechanism studies.

### [326] [Cost-Sensitive Evaluation for Binary Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22016)
*Pierangelo Lombardo,Antonio Casoli,Cristian Cingolani,Shola Oshodi,Michele Zanatta*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的评估指标Weighted Accuracy (WA)，用于二分类器，旨在最小化总分类成本（TCC），并澄清了类别不平衡处理的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏统一的分类器评估标准，且对数据集不平衡处理的误解较多。目标是最大化投资回报或最小化TCC。

Method: 定义了WA指标，作为准确率的加权版本，并提出了处理类别不平衡的框架，适用于任何线性组合的指标。

Result: WA与TCC在示例依赖场景中表现出强相关性，证明了其鲁棒性。

Conclusion: WA是一种有效的评估指标，适用于成本敏感场景，并提供了处理类别不平衡的替代方案。

Abstract: Selecting an appropriate evaluation metric for classifiers is crucial for
model comparison and parameter optimization, yet there is not consensus on a
universally accepted metric that serves as a definitive standard. Moreover,
there is often a misconception about the perceived need to mitigate imbalance
in datasets used to train classification models. Since the final goal in
classifier optimization is typically maximizing the return of investment or,
equivalently, minimizing the Total Classification Cost (TCC), we define
Weighted Accuracy (WA), an evaluation metric for binary classifiers with a
straightforward interpretation as a weighted version of the well-known accuracy
metric, coherent with the need of minimizing TCC. We clarify the conceptual
framework for handling class imbalance in cost-sensitive scenarios, providing
an alternative to rebalancing techniques. This framework can be applied to any
metric that, like WA, can be expressed as a linear combination of
example-dependent quantities and allows for comparing the results obtained in
different datasets and for addressing discrepancies between the development
dataset, used to train and validate the model, and the target dataset, where
the model will be deployed. It also specifies in which scenarios using
UCCs-unaware class rebalancing techniques or rebalancing metrics aligns with
TCC minimization and when it is instead counterproductive. Finally, we propose
a procedure to estimate the WA weight parameter in the absence of fully
specified UCCs and demonstrate the robustness of WA by analyzing its
correlation with TCC in example-dependent scenarios.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种考虑制度信任的强化学习算法，用于社区资源分配，并探讨了信任对政策效果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法假设公民会遵循政策，但现实中缺乏制度信任会导致政策失败。

Result: 考虑信任的算法能提高政策成功率，但保守信任估计会降低组织成功率。

Conclusion: 制度信任在算法设计中至关重要，组织成功与社区福祉之间存在张力。

Abstract: Many governmental bodies are adopting AI policies for decision-making. In
particular, Reinforcement Learning has been used to design policies that
citizens would be expected to follow if implemented. Much RL work assumes that
citizens follow these policies, and evaluate them with this in mind. However,
we know from prior work that without institutional trust, citizens will not
follow policies put in place by governments. In this work, we develop a
trust-aware RL algorithm for resource allocation in communities. We consider
the case of humanitarian engineering, where the organization is aiming to
distribute some technology or resource to community members. We use a Deep
Deterministic Policy Gradient approach to learn a resource allocation that fits
the needs of the organization. Then, we simulate resource allocation according
to the learned policy, and model the changes in institutional trust of
community members. We investigate how this incorporation of institutional trust
affects outcomes, and ask how effectively an organization can learn policies if
trust values are private. We find that incorporating trust into RL algorithms
can lead to more successful policies, specifically when the organization's
goals are less certain. We find more conservative trust estimates lead to
increased fairness and average community trust, though organization success
suffers. Finally, we explore a strategy to prevent unfair outcomes to
communities. We implement a quota system by an external entity which decreases
the organization's utility when it does not serve enough community members. We
find this intervention can improve fairness and trust among communities in some
cases, while decreasing the success of the organization. This work underscores
the importance of institutional trust in algorithm design and implementation,
and identifies a tension between organization success and community well-being.

TL;DR: KKANs通过减少KAN的样条层并引入Chebyshev层和多层感知机，提高了训练稳定性和计算效率。K-DAREK进一步优化了KKAN架构，实现了高效且可解释的函数逼近，并具备不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络和Gaussian processes在可解释性、计算效率和泛化能力上存在局限性，KKANs和K-DAREK旨在解决这些问题。

Method: KKANs通过Chebyshev层和多层感知机扩展输入空间，再应用样条变换；K-DAREK引入距离感知误差边界，优化训练和不确定性量化。

Result: K-DAREK在安全控制任务中表现出色，计算效率比Ensemble of KANs高4倍，比GP高8.6倍，安全性比DAREK高50%。

Conclusion: K-DAREK是一种高效、可解释且具备不确定性量化的函数逼近方法，适用于动态系统建模和安全控制任务。

Abstract: Neural networks are parametric and powerful tools for function approximation,
and the choice of architecture heavily influences their interpretability,
efficiency, and generalization. In contrast, Gaussian processes (GPs) are
nonparametric probabilistic models that define distributions over functions
using a kernel to capture correlations among data points. However, these models
become computationally expensive for large-scale problems, as they require
inverting a large covariance matrix. Kolmogorov- Arnold networks (KANs),
semi-parametric neural architectures, have emerged as a prominent approach for
modeling complex functions with structured and efficient representations
through spline layers. Kurkova Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KKANs) extend this
idea by reducing the number of spline layers in KAN and replacing them with
Chebyshev layers and multi-layer perceptrons, thereby mapping inputs into
higher-dimensional spaces before applying spline-based transformations.
Compared to KANs, KKANs perform more stable convergence during training, making
them a strong architecture for estimating operators and system modeling in
dynamical systems. By enhancing the KKAN architecture, we develop a novel
learning algorithm, distance-aware error for Kurkova-Kolmogorov networks
(K-DAREK), for efficient and interpretable function approximation with
uncertainty quantification. Our approach establishes robust error bounds that
are distance-aware; this means they reflect the proximity of a test point to
its nearest training points. Through case studies on a safe control task, we
demonstrate that K-DAREK is about four times faster and ten times higher
computationally efficiency than Ensemble of KANs, 8.6 times more scalable than
GP by increasing the data size, and 50% safer than our previous work
distance-aware error for Kolmogorov networks (DAREK).

Conclusion: 归一化方案通过速度调节影响表示演化，Peri-LN表现优异，为方案选择提供理论依据。

Abstract: We study the effect of normalization schemes on token representations in deep
transformers. Modeling their evolution as interacting particles on the sphere,
we show that normalization acts as a form of speed regulation. This perspective
enables a unified analysis of several schemes -- including Post-LN, Pre-LN,
Mix-LN, Peri-LN, nGPT, and LN-Scaling -- revealing how they influence
clustering dynamics and representation collapse. Our framework clarifies how
different schemes shape token representations across layers and provides a
principled basis for comparing them, identifying Peri-LN as a particularly
effective choice.

Abstract: We study the problem of Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning (OSRL), where the
goal is to learn a reward-maximizing policy from fixed data under a cumulative
cost constraint. We propose a novel OSRL approach that frames the problem as a
minimax objective and solves it by combining offline RL with online
optimization algorithms. We prove the approximate optimality of this approach
when integrated with an approximate offline RL oracle and no-regret online
optimization. We also present a practical approximation that can be combined
with any offline RL algorithm, eliminating the need for offline policy
evaluation. Empirical results on the DSRL benchmark demonstrate that our method
reliably enforces safety constraints under stringent cost budgets, while
achieving high rewards. The code is available at

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data is a fundamental task in artificial
intelligence, with far-reaching implications for decision-making, predictions,
and interventions. Despite significant advances, existing methods can be
broadly categorized as constraint-based or score-based approaches.
Constraint-based methods offer rigorous causal discovery but are often hindered
by small sample sizes, while score-based methods provide flexible optimization
but typically forgo explicit conditional independence testing. This work
explores a third avenue: developing differentiable $d$-separation scores,
obtained through a percolation theory using soft logic. This enables the
implementation of a new type of causal discovery method: gradient-based
optimization of conditional independence constraints. Empirical evaluations
demonstrate the robust performance of our approach in low-sample regimes,
surpassing traditional constraint-based and score-based baselines on a
real-world dataset. Code and data of the proposed method are publicly available
at https://github$.$com/PurdueMINDS/DAGPA.

Motivation: 单细胞技术生成的高维点云数据难以直接量化个体间的生物学差异，且现有非线性方法缺乏可解释性。

Method: 采用线性最优传输（LOT）框架，将点云嵌入到固定维度的欧几里得空间，保留分布结构并支持下游分析。

Result: LOT实现了COVID-19患者状态的准确分类和可解释性，并支持合成数据生成和药物相互作用测试。

Conclusion: LOT为高维生物系统提供了一种统一框架，兼具预测性能、可解释性和生成建模能力。

Abstract: Single-cell technologies generate high-dimensional point clouds of cells,
enabling detailed characterization of complex patient states and treatment
responses. Yet each patient is represented by an irregular point cloud rather
than a simple vector, making it difficult to directly quantify and compare
biological differences between individuals. Nonlinear methods such as kernels
and neural networks achieve predictive accuracy but act as black boxes,
offering little biological interpretability.
  To address these limitations, we adapt the Linear Optimal Transport (LOT)
framework to this setting, embedding irregular point clouds into a
fixed-dimensional Euclidean space while preserving distributional structure.
This embedding provides a principled linear representation that preserves
optimal transport geometry while enabling downstream analysis. It also forms a
registration between any two patients, enabling direct comparison of their
cellular distributions. Within this space, LOT enables: (i) \textbf{accurate
and interpretable classification} of COVID-19 patient states, where classifier
weights map back to specific markers and spatial regions driving predictions;
and (ii) \textbf{synthetic data generation} for patient-derived organoids,
exploiting the linearity of the LOT embedding. LOT barycenters yield averaged
cellular profiles representing combined conditions or samples, supporting drug
interaction testing.
  Together, these results establish LOT as a unified framework that bridges
predictive performance, interpretability, and generative modeling. By
transforming heterogeneous point clouds into structured embeddings directly
traceable to the original data, LOT opens new opportunities for understanding
immune variation and treatment effects in high-dimensional biological systems.

Result: 通过数学分析和实验验证，证明了所提方法的可扩展性和准确性，并比较了其与Multinomial Logit模型的预测能力。

Conclusion: 本文为关键决策场景提供了新的分析和预测工具，扩展了Mallows模型的应用范围。

Abstract: The classic Mallows model is a foundational tool for modeling user
preferences. However, it has limitations in capturing real-world scenarios,
where users often focus only on a limited set of preferred items and are
indifferent to the rest. To address this, extensions such as the top-k Mallows
model have been proposed, aligning better with practical applications. In this
paper, we address several challenges related to the generalized top-k Mallows
model, with a focus on analyzing buyer choices. Our key contributions are: (1)
a novel sampling scheme tailored to generalized top-k Mallows models, (2) an
efficient algorithm for computing choice probabilities under this model, and
(3) an active learning algorithm for estimating the model parameters from
observed choice data. These contributions provide new tools for analysis and
prediction in critical decision-making scenarios. We present a rigorous
mathematical analysis for the performance of our algorithms. Furthermore,
through extensive experiments on synthetic data and real-world data, we
demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our proposed methods, and we
compare the predictive power of Mallows model for top-k lists compared to the
simpler Multinomial Logit model.

Abstract: Sampling from constrained statistical distributions is a fundamental task in
various fields including Bayesian statistics, computational chemistry, and
statistical physics. This article considers the cases where the constrained
distribution is described by an unconstrained density, as well as additional
equality and/or inequality constraints, which often make the constraint set
nonconvex. Existing methods for nonconvex constraint set $\Sigma \subset
\mathbb{R}^d$ defined by equality or inequality constraints commonly rely on
costly projection steps. Moreover, they cannot handle equality and inequality
constraints simultaneously as each method only specialized in one case. In
addition, rigorous and quantitative convergence guarantee is often lacking. In
this paper, we introduce Overdamped Langevin with LAnding (OLLA), a new
framework that can design overdamped Langevin dynamics accommodating both
equality and inequality constraints. The proposed dynamics also
deterministically corrects trajectories along the normal direction of the
constraint surface, thus obviating the need for explicit projections. We show
that, under suitable regularity conditions on the target density and $\Sigma$,
OLLA converges exponentially fast in $W_2$ distance to the constrained target
density $\rho_\Sigma(x) \propto \exp(-f(x))d\sigma_\Sigma$. Lastly, through
experiments, we demonstrate the efficiency of OLLA compared to projection-based
constrained Langevin algorithms and their slack variable variants, highlighting
its favorable computational cost and reasonable empirical mixing.

Abstract: Power flow (PF) calculations are the backbone of real-time grid operations,
across workflows such as contingency analysis (where repeated PF evaluations
assess grid security under outages) and topology optimization (which involves
PF-based searches over combinatorially large action spaces). Running these
calculations at operational timescales or across large evaluation spaces
remains a major computational bottleneck. Additionally, growing uncertainty in
power system operations from the integration of renewables and climate-induced
extreme weather also calls for tools that can accurately and efficiently
simulate a wide range of scenarios and operating conditions. Machine learning
methods offer a potential speedup over traditional solvers, but their
performance has not been systematically assessed on benchmarks that capture
real-world variability. This paper introduces PF$\Delta$, a benchmark dataset
for power flow that captures diverse variations in load, generation, and
topology. PF$\Delta$ contains 859,800 solved power flow instances spanning six
different bus system sizes, capturing three types of contingency scenarios (N ,
N -1, and N -2), and including close-to-infeasible cases near steady-state
voltage stability limits. We evaluate traditional solvers and GNN-based
methods, highlighting key areas where existing approaches struggle, and
identifying open problems for future research. Our dataset is available at

Abstract: With the rise of online and virtual learning, monitoring and enhancing
student engagement have become an important aspect of effective education.
Traditional methods of assessing a student's involvement might not be
applicable directly to virtual environments. In this study, we focused on this
problem and addressed the need to develop an automated system to detect student
engagement levels during online learning. We proposed a novel training method
which can discourage a model from leveraging sensitive features like gender for
its predictions. The proposed method offers benefits not only in the
enforcement of ethical standards, but also to enhance interpretability of the
model predictions. We applied an attribute-orthogonal regularization technique
to a split-model classifier, which uses multiple transfer learning strategies
to achieve effective results in reducing disparity in the distribution of
prediction for sensitivity groups from a Pearson correlation coefficient of
0.897 for the unmitigated model, to 0.999 for the mitigated model. The source

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are known to operate with high accuracy on
learning from graph-structured data, but they suffer from high computational
and resource costs. Neural network compression methods are used to reduce the
model size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. Two of the common neural
network compression techniques include pruning and quantization. In this
research, we empirically examine the effects of three pruning methods and three
quantization methods on different GNN models, including graph classification
tasks, node classification tasks, and link prediction. We conducted all
experiments on three graph datasets, including Cora, Proteins, and BBBP. Our
findings demonstrate that unstructured fine-grained and global pruning can
significantly reduce the model's size(50\%) while maintaining or even improving
precision after fine-tuning the pruned model. The evaluation of different
quantization methods on GNN shows diverse impacts on accuracy, inference time,
and model size across different datasets.

Conclusion: DGPFM通过灵活的设计和可扩展的概率推断，显著提升了函数映射的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Learning mappings between functional spaces, also known as
function-on-function regression, plays a crucial role in functional data
analysis and has broad applications, e.g. spatiotemporal forecasting, curve
prediction, and climate modeling. Existing approaches, such as functional
linear models and neural operators, either fall short of capturing complex
nonlinearities or lack reliable uncertainty quantification under noisy, sparse,
and irregularly sampled data. To address these issues, we propose Deep Gaussian
Processes for Functional Maps (DGPFM). Our method designs a sequence of
GP-based linear and nonlinear transformations, leveraging integral transforms
of kernels, GP interpolation, and nonlinear activations sampled from GPs. A key
insight simplifies implementation: under fixed locations, discrete
approximations of kernel integral transforms collapse into direct functional
integral transforms, enabling flexible incorporation of various integral
transform designs. To achieve scalable probabilistic inference, we use inducing
points and whitening transformations to develop a variational learning
algorithm. Empirical results on real-world and PDE benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the advantage of DGPFM in both predictive performance and
uncertainty calibration.

Motivation: 现实场景（如医疗）中多干预措施的成本和约束异质性，传统RMAB的二元动作和单一预算假设不适用。

Method: 使用神经网络为臂-动作对分配预算感知索引，并通过基于熵正则化最优传输的可微分背包层转换为可行分配。

Result: NIP在严格预算约束下，性能接近最优（与理论上限相差5%），且可扩展到数百个臂。

Conclusion: NIP为复杂资源受限环境中的索引策略学习提供了理论支持且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Restless multi-armed bandits (RMABs) provide a scalable framework for
sequential decision-making under uncertainty, but classical formulations assume
binary actions and a single global budget. Real-world settings, such as
healthcare, often involve multiple interventions with heterogeneous costs and
constraints, where such assumptions break down. We introduce a Neural Index
Policy (NIP) for multi-action RMABs with heterogeneous budget constraints. Our
approach learns to assign budget-aware indices to arm--action pairs using a
neural network, and converts them into feasible allocations via a
differentiable knapsack layer formulated as an entropy-regularized optimal
transport (OT) problem. The resulting model unifies index prediction and
constrained optimization in a single end-to-end differentiable framework,
enabling gradient-based training directly on decision quality. The network is
optimized to align its induced occupancy measure with the theoretical upper
bound from a linear programming relaxation, bridging asymptotic RMAB theory
with practical learning. Empirically, NIP achieves near-optimal performance
within 5% of the oracle occupancy-measure policy while strictly enforcing
heterogeneous budgets and scaling to hundreds of arms. This work establishes a
general, theoretically grounded, and scalable framework for learning
index-based policies in complex resource-constrained environments.

and classification within a single modular framework. The model is built as a
hierarchy of invertible and differentiable bijections, where the Jacobian
determinant factorizes across sub-transformations. We show how this ensures
exact likelihood computation and stable optimization, while invertibility
enables explicit visualization of sample likelihoods, providing an
interpretable lens into the model's reasoning. By conditioning on class labels,
MAGIC-Flow supports controllable sample synthesis and principled
class-probability estimation, effectively aiding both generative and
discriminative objectives. We evaluate MAGIC-Flow against top baselines using
metrics for similarity, fidelity, and diversity. Across multiple datasets, it
addresses generation and classification under scanner noise, and
modality-specific synthesis and identification. Results show MAGIC-Flow creates
realistic, diverse samples and improves classification. MAGIC-Flow is an
effective strategy for generation and classification in data-limited domains,
with direct benefits for privacy-preserving augmentation, robust
generalization, and trustworthy medical AI.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在真实代码库中训练代码修复代理时因复杂构建和依赖变化导致评估不稳定的问题。

Method: 使用固定依赖和禁用自动升级的可验证流程，并在简化环境中进行大规模强化学习。

Result: SFT模型与GPT-4.1性能相当但体积小56倍，RL在匹配条件下带来7-20%的绝对提升。

Conclusion: 训练和测试环境匹配对构建可靠的代码修复代理至关重要，模型在跨环境泛化上表现不佳。

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of training reliable code-fixing agents in real
repositories, where complex builds and shifting dependencies make evaluation
unstable. We developed a verifiable pipeline with success defined as post-fix
build validation and improved reproducibility across ~1K real issues by pinning
dependencies and disabling automatic upgrades. Building on this, we introduced
a scalable simplified pipeline for large-scale reinforcement learning (RL).
Using this setup, we supervised fine-tuned Qwen3-32B in the full pipeline and
applied RL on top of the SFT model in the simplified environment. The SFT model
distilled from GPT-4.1 trajectories performs on par while being 56x smaller,
and RL added 7-20% absolute gains under matched train-test conditions.
"Thinking mode" was on par or worse in our experiments. Both SFT and RL models
failed to generalize across environments, highlighting the importance of
matching train-test environments for building reliable real-world code-fixing
agents.

TL;DR: HiFlowCast和HiAntFlow是两种基于HGNN的多尺度预测框架，通过保留全局趋势和整合物理方程解场，显著提高了长期和极端天气预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统固定分辨率方法无法捕捉多尺度物理过程，导致天气预测不准确，且非线性向下映射常会抹去全局趋势。

Method: 提出Latent-Memory-Retention机制保留全局趋势，以及Latent-to-Physics分支整合多尺度PDE解场。

Result: 在13天预测中误差降低5%以上，极端天气条件下误差降低5-8%，且训练成本低。

Conclusion: HiFlowCast和HiAntFlow通过高效的多尺度物理整合，提升了预测可靠性，同时降低了训练成本和碳足迹。

Abstract: Climate events arise from intricate, multivariate dynamics governed by
global-scale drivers, profoundly impacting food, energy, and infrastructure.
Yet, accurate weather prediction remains elusive due to physical processes
unfolding across diverse spatio-temporal scales, which fixed-resolution methods
cannot capture. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) offer a multiscale
representation, but nonlinear downward mappings often erase global trends,
weakening the integration of physics into forecasts. We introduce HiFlowCast
and its ensemble variant HiAntFlow, HGNNs that embed physics within a
multiscale prediction framework. Two innovations underpin their design: a
Latent-Memory-Retention mechanism that preserves global trends during downward
traversal, and a Latent-to-Physics branch that integrates PDE solution fields
across diverse scales. Our Flow models cut errors by over 5% at 13-day lead
times and by 5-8% under 1st and 99th quantile extremes, improving reliability
for rare events. Leveraging pretrained model weights, they converge within a
single epoch, reducing training cost and their carbon footprint. Such
efficiency is vital as the growing scale of machine learning challenges
sustainability and limits research accessibility. Code and model weights are in
the supplementary materials.

Motivation: 传统PBPK建模依赖简化假设的微分方程，难以捕捉非线性生理相互作用，因此需要更灵活的数据驱动方法。

Method: 研究比较了多层感知机（MLP）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM），并提出动态GNN来建模器官间的时空依赖关系。

Result: 动态GNN表现最佳（R²=0.9342，RMSE=0.0159，MAE=0.0116），显著优于MLP和LSTM基线模型。

Conclusion: 动态GNN为PBPK建模提供了无需方程的替代方案，展示了在药代动力学研究中的潜力。

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling plays a critical role
in drug development by predicting drug concentration dynamics across organs.
Traditional approaches rely on ordinary differential equations with strong
simplifying assumptions, which limit their adaptability to nonlinear
physiological interactions. In this study, we explore data-driven alternatives
for PBPK prediction using deep learning. Two baseline architectures - a
multilayer perceptron (MLP) and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network - are
implemented to capture molecular and temporal dependencies, respectively. To
incorporate inter-organ interactions, we propose a Dynamic Graph Neural Network
(Dynamic GNN) that models physiological connections as recurrent
message-passing processes between organs. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed Dynamic GNN achieves the highest predictive performance among all
models, with an R^2 of 0.9342, an RMSE of 0.0159, and an MAE of 0.0116. In
comparison, the MLP baseline obtains an R^2 of 0.8705 and the LSTM achieves
0.8059. These results highlight that explicitly modeling the spatial and
temporal dependencies of organ interactions enables more accurate and
generalizable drug concentration prediction. The Dynamic GNN provides a
scalable, equation-free alternative to traditional PBPK formulations and
demonstrates strong potential for data-driven pharmacokinetic modeling in
preclinical and clinical research.

Abstract: Coordinate denoising has emerged as a promising method for 3D molecular
pretraining due to its theoretical connection to learning molecular force
field. However, existing denoising methods rely on oversimplied molecular
dynamics that assume atomic motions to be isotropic and homoscedastic. To
address these limitations, we propose a novel denoising framework AniDS:
Anisotropic Variational Autoencoder for 3D Molecular Denoising. AniDS
introduces a structure-aware anisotropic noise generator that can produce
atom-specific, full covariance matrices for Gaussian noise distributions to
better reflect directional and structural variability in molecular systems.
These covariances are derived from pairwise atomic interactions as anisotropic
corrections to an isotropic base. Our design ensures that the resulting
covariance matrices are symmetric, positive semi-definite, and
SO(3)-equivariant, while providing greater capacity to model complex molecular
dynamics. Extensive experiments show that AniDS outperforms prior isotropic and
homoscedastic denoising models and other leading methods on the MD17 and OC22
benchmarks, achieving average relative improvements of 8.9% and 6.2% in force
prediction accuracy. Our case study on a crystal and molecule structure shows
that AniDS adaptively suppresses noise along the bonding direction, consistent
with physicochemical principles. Our code is available at

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to efficiently remove sensitive or harmful
memory from a pre-trained model. The key challenge is to balance the potential
tradeoff between unlearning efficacy and utility preservation, which involves
forgetting undesirable information as defined while maintaining the model's
original performance. One potential way to tackle this problem is to use
multi-objective optimization to jointly optimize both the unlearning and
utility preservation objectives. However, existing multi-objective methods only
guarantee finding a Pareto-optimal solution without fine-grained control, which
causes under-optimization of the unlearning objective. To this end, we first
model MU as a constrained optimization problem, that is, optimizing the
unlearning objective under the constraint of a bounded increase for utility
loss. We then show that solving this optimization problem is equivalent to
unilateral gradient surgery on the unlearning objective. To resolve the
additional computational cost brought by gradient surgery, we propose an
implicit gradient surgery method, which approximates the solution to the
aforementioned constrained optimization problem via only one backpropagation,
thereby achieving efficient utility-preserving MU. Theoretically, we provide a
tight convergence analysis of the algorithm. Empirically, our extensive
experiments show that the proposed algorithm achieves better tradeoff results
than existing baselines. Codes are available at

Conclusion: 该工作为NCO模型的解释提供了系统方法，展示了探测工具在揭示内部机制方面的潜力，并提出了改进模型泛化的实际应用。

Abstract: Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) has achieved remarkable performance,
yet its learned model representations and decision rationale remain a black
box. This impedes both academic research and practical deployment, since
researchers and stakeholders require deeper insights into NCO models. In this
paper, we take the first critical step towards interpreting NCO models by
investigating their representations through various probing tasks. Moreover, we
introduce a novel probing tool named Coefficient Significance Probing
(CS-Probing) to enable deeper analysis of NCO representations by examining the
coefficients and statistical significance during probing. Extensive experiments
and analysis reveal that NCO models encode low-level information essential for
solution construction, while capturing high-level knowledge to facilitate
better decisions. Using CS-Probing, we find that prevalent NCO models impose
varying inductive biases on their learned representations, uncover direct
evidence related to model generalization, and identify key embedding dimensions
associated with specific knowledge. These insights can be potentially
translated into practice, for example, with minor code modifications, we
improve the generalization of the analyzed model. Our work represents a first
systematic attempt to interpret black-box NCO models, showcasing probing as a
promising tool for analyzing their internal mechanisms and revealing insights
for the NCO community. The source code is publicly available.

Motivation: 传统Shapley值和交互指数计算复杂度高（O(2^n)），难以扩展到大特征集。TN-SHAP旨在通过张量网络简化计算。

Method: 利用张量网络（TN）构建预测器的局部行为模型，将联盟量化为线性探测系数张量，减少计算量。

Result: 在UCI数据集上，TN-SHAP与枚举法精度相当，但计算量大幅减少，速度提升25-1000倍。

Conclusion: TN-SHAP是一种高效且精确的替代方法，适用于大规模特征集的Shapley值和交互指数计算。

Abstract: We show how to replace the O(2^n) coalition enumeration over n features
behind Shapley values and Shapley-style interaction indices with a
few-evaluation scheme on a tensor-network (TN) surrogate: TN-SHAP. The key idea
is to represent a predictor's local behavior as a factorized multilinear map,
so that coalitional quantities become linear probes of a coefficient tensor.
TN-SHAP replaces exhaustive coalition sweeps with just a small number of
targeted evaluations to extract order-k Shapley interactions. In particular,
both order-1 (single-feature) and order-2 (pairwise) computations have cost
O(n*poly(chi) + n^2), where chi is the TN's maximal cut rank. We provide
theoretical guarantees on the approximation error and tractability of TN-SHAP.
On UCI datasets, our method matches enumeration on the fitted surrogate while
reducing evaluation by orders of magnitude and achieves 25-1000x wall-clock
speedups over KernelSHAP-IQ at comparable accuracy, while amortizing training
across local cohorts.

Conclusion: NMKE通过精确的神经元级编辑，有效解决了持续知识编辑中的错误积累问题。

Abstract: Lifelong knowledge editing enables continuous, precise updates to outdated
knowledge in large language models (LLMs) without computationally expensive
full retraining. However, existing methods often accumulate errors throughout
the editing process, causing a gradual decline in both editing accuracy and
generalization. To tackle this problem, we propose Neuron-Specific Masked
Knowledge Editing (NMKE), a novel fine-grained editing framework that combines
neuron-level attribution with dynamic sparse masking. Leveraging neuron
functional attribution, we identify two key types of knowledge neurons, with
knowledge-general neurons activating consistently across prompts and
knowledge-specific neurons activating to specific prompts. NMKE further
introduces an entropy-guided dynamic sparse mask, locating relevant neurons to
the target knowledge. This strategy enables precise neuron-level knowledge
editing with fewer parameter modifications. Experimental results from thousands
of sequential edits demonstrate that NMKE outperforms existing methods in
maintaining high editing success rates and preserving model general
capabilities in lifelong editing.

Result: 通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了独裁者客户端对全局模型收敛的显著影响。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了联邦学习中独裁者客户端的潜在威胁，为未来防御机制的设计提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for decentralized
model training, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively learn a shared
model without exchanging their local data. However, the decentralized nature of
FL also introduces vulnerabilities, as malicious clients can compromise or
manipulate the training process. In this work, we introduce dictator clients, a
novel, well-defined, and analytically tractable class of malicious participants
capable of entirely erasing the contributions of all other clients from the
server model, while preserving their own. We propose concrete attack strategies
that empower such clients and systematically analyze their effects on the
learning process. Furthermore, we explore complex scenarios involving multiple
dictator clients, including cases where they collaborate, act independently, or
form an alliance in order to ultimately betray one another. For each of these
settings, we provide a theoretical analysis of their impact on the global
model's convergence. Our theoretical algorithms and findings about the complex
scenarios including multiple dictator clients are further supported by
empirical evaluations on both computer vision and natural language processing
benchmarks.

Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling
interactions in large-scale multi-agent systems. Despite recent advancements in
reinforcement learning (RL) for MFGs, existing methods are typically limited to
finite spaces or stationary models, hindering their applicability to real-world
problems. This paper introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)
algorithm specifically designed for non-stationary continuous MFGs. The
proposed approach builds upon a Fictitious Play (FP) methodology, leveraging
DRL for best-response computation and supervised learning for average policy
representation. Furthermore, it learns a representation of the time-dependent
population distribution using a Conditional Normalizing Flow. To validate the
effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on three different examples of
increasing complexity. By addressing critical limitations in scalability and
density approximation, this work represents a significant advancement in
applying DRL techniques to complex MFG problems, bringing the field closer to
real-world multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 论文在嵌入维度和双Lipschitz性质方面取得了显著进展，为图深度学习提供了更优的理论支持。

Abstract: We study the sorting-based embedding $\beta_{\mathbf A} : \mathbb R^{n \times
d} \to \mathbb R^{n \times D}$, $\mathbf X \mapsto {\downarrow}(\mathbf X
\mathbf A)$, where $\downarrow$ denotes column wise sorting of matrices. Such
embeddings arise in graph deep learning where outputs should be invariant to
permutations of graph nodes. Previous work showed that for large enough $D$ and
appropriate $\mathbf A$, the mapping $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is injective, and
moreover satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition. However, two gaps remain: firstly,
the optimal size $D$ required for injectivity is not yet known, and secondly,
no estimates of the bi-Lipschitz constants of the mapping are known.
  In this paper, we make substantial progress in addressing both of these gaps.
Regarding the first gap, we improve upon the best known upper bounds for the
embedding dimension $D$ necessary for injectivity, and also provide a lower
bound on the minimal injectivity dimension. Regarding the second gap, we
construct matrices $\mathbf A$, so that the bi-Lipschitz distortion of
$\beta_{\mathbf A} $ depends quadratically on $n$, and is completely
independent of $d$. We also show that the distortion of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ is
necessarily at least in $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$. Finally, we provide similar results
for variants of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$ obtained by applying linear projections to
reduce the output dimension of $\beta_{\mathbf A}$.

Abstract: Task-specific pre-training is essential when task representations diverge
from generic pre-training features. Existing task-general pre-training EEG
models struggle with complex tasks like emotion recognition due to mismatches
between task-specific features and broad pre-training approaches. This work
aims to develop a task-specific multi-dataset joint pre-training framework for
cross-dataset emotion recognition, tackling problems of large inter-dataset
distribution shifts, inconsistent emotion category definitions, and substantial
inter-subject variability. We introduce a cross-dataset covariance alignment
loss to align second-order statistical properties across datasets, enabling
robust generalization without the need for extensive labels or per-subject
calibration. To capture the long-term dependency and complex dynamics of EEG,
we propose a hybrid encoder combining a Mamba-like linear attention channel
encoder and a spatiotemporal dynamics model. Our method outperforms
state-of-the-art large-scale EEG models by an average of 4.57% in AUROC for
few-shot emotion recognition and 11.92% in accuracy for zero-shot
generalization to a new dataset. Performance scales with the increase of
datasets used in pre-training. Multi-dataset joint pre-training achieves a
performance gain of 8.55% over single-dataset training. This work provides a
scalable framework for task-specific pre-training and highlights its benefit in
generalizable affective computing. Our code is available at

Result: EPC在比特率和保真度上优于基线方法Predictive Masking (PM)和VQ+RE。

Conclusion: EPC通过更高效利用模型内在知识，实现了更优的压缩性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve near-optimal lossless compression by
acting as powerful probability models. We investigate their use in the lossy
domain, where reconstruction fidelity is traded for higher compression ratios.
This paper introduces Error-Bounded Predictive Coding (EPC), a lossy text codec
that leverages a Masked Language Model (MLM) as a decompressor. Instead of
storing a subset of original tokens, EPC allows the model to predict masked
content and stores minimal, rank-based corrections only when the model's top
prediction is incorrect. This creates a residual channel that offers continuous
rate-distortion control. We compare EPC to a simpler Predictive Masking (PM)
baseline and a transform-based Vector Quantisation with a Residual Patch
(VQ+RE) approach. Through an evaluation that includes precise bit accounting
and rate-distortion analysis, we demonstrate that EPC consistently dominates
PM, offering superior fidelity at a significantly lower bit rate by more
efficiently utilising the model's intrinsic knowledge.

Abstract: Pretrained models are ubiquitous in the current deep learning landscape,
offering strong results on a broad range of tasks. Recent works have shown that
models differing in various design choices exhibit categorically diverse
generalization behavior, resulting in one model grasping distinct data-specific
insights unavailable to the other. In this paper, we propose to leverage large
publicly available model repositories as an auxiliary source of model
improvements. We introduce a data partitioning strategy where pretrained models
autonomously adopt either the role of a student, seeking knowledge, or that of
a teacher, imparting knowledge. Experiments across various tasks demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed approach. In image classification, we
improved the performance of ViT-B by approximately 1.4% through bidirectional
knowledge transfer with ViT-T. For semantic segmentation, our method boosted
all evaluation metrics by enabling knowledge transfer both within and across
backbone architectures. In video saliency prediction, our approach achieved a
new state-of-the-art. We further extend our approach to knowledge transfer
between multiple models, leading to considerable performance improvements for
all model participants.

leverages weakly supervised metric learning to learn a Mahalanobis distance
that reflects similarity in fairness and performance outcomes, effectively
structuring the feature importance space of the models according to
stakeholder-relevant criteria. We then apply clustering technique (k-means) to
group models based on their transformed representations of feature importances,
allowing users to explore clusters of models with similar predictive behaviors
and fairness characteristics. This facilitates informed decision-making by
helping users understand how models differ not only in their
fairness-performance balance but also in the features that drive their
predictions.

TL;DR: 层剪枝对大型语言模型（LLMs）的长链推理能力有显著负面影响，即使仅剪枝一两层也会严重损害推理性能，且标准微调方法无法恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究层剪枝对LLMs长链推理能力的影响，尤其是测试时缩放（test-time scaling）这一关键机制的作用。

Method: 通过实验分析层剪枝对测试时缩放的影响，评估其在长链推理任务中的表现。

Result: 剪枝会严重损害测试时缩放，导致长链推理性能崩溃，且标准微调无法修复。

Conclusion: 层剪枝对推理密集型LLMs存在根本性风险，需重新思考剪枝策略以保护推理鲁棒性。

Abstract: Layer pruning has emerged as a widely adopted technique for improving the
efficiency of large language models (LLMs). Although existing methods
demonstrate strong performance retention on general knowledge tasks, their
effect on long-chain reasoning, a more brittle yet crucial capability, remains
largely unexplored. In this work, we study the impact of layer pruning on
long-chain reasoning through the lens of test-time scaling, a key mechanism in
modern LLMs that enables strong reasoning capacity by allocating more
computation at inference time. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
pruning even one or two layers can severely impair test-time scaling, with
performance collapsing drastically on long reasoning benchmarks even when
performance on knowledge-intensive and shallow reasoning tasks remains stable.
Furthermore, we find that standard supervised fine-tuning remedies fail to
recover test-time scaling once it has deteriorated. Through in-depth analyses,
we identify the mechanisms underlying this fragility of test-time scaling and
highlight the fundamental risks of applying layer pruning to
reasoning-intensive LLMs. These findings call for a rethinking of layer pruning
strategies and provide insights for developing methods that preserve the
robustness of reasoning. We open-source the codebase in

TL;DR: LUNA是一种自监督基础模型，通过统一不同电极布局的EEG数据，显著提升了模型的可扩展性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决EEG数据中电极布局异构性导致的模型泛化问题。

Method: 使用学习查询和交叉注意力将多通道EEG压缩为固定大小的拓扑无关潜在空间，并通过下游Transformer块处理。

Result: 在多个下游任务中表现优异，如异常检测和情绪识别，同时显著降低计算和内存开销。

Conclusion: LUNA为大规模EEG建模提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) offers a non-invasive lens into human brain
activity, but building large-scale models is hampered by topological
heterogeneity: each public EEG data defines its own electrode layout, limiting
generalization. We introduce LUNA (Latent Unified Network Architecture), a
self-supervised foundation model that reconciles disparate electrode geometries
while scaling linearly -- not quadratically -- with channel count. LUNA
compresses multi-channel EEG into a fixed-size, topology-agnostic latent space
via learned queries and cross-attention. Downstream transformer blocks then
operate exclusively on this latent representation using patch-wise temporal
self-attention, decoupling computation from electrode count. Pre-trained on
TUEG and Siena (over 21,000 hours of raw EEG across diverse montages) using a
masked-patch reconstruction objective, LUNA transfers effectively to four
downstream tasks: abnormality detection, artifact rejection, slowing
classification, and emotion recognition. It demonstrates highly competitive
performance across several benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art results on
TUAR and TUSL, e.g., 0.921 AUROC on TUAR, while reducing FLOPs by 300x and
trimming GPU memory use by up to 10x. Critically, these gains are consistent
across all evaluated electrode configurations. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习在安全关键领域的应用因无法处理不确定性而受限，导致模型在面对分布外数据或对抗扰动时产生过度自信的预测。

Method: 开发了随机集神经网络（RS-NN），利用随机集理论预测类别集合的置信函数，并通过相关置信集的宽度量化认知不确定性。

Result: 实验表明，RS-NN不仅减少了过度自信预测的风险，还为不确定性感知分类器提供了统一的评估框架。

Conclusion: 认知深度学习为人工智能的范式转变奠定了基础，强调'知道何时不知道'是构建稳健系统的关键。

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable successes, yet its deployment in
safety-critical domains remains hindered by an inherent inability to manage
uncertainty, resulting in overconfident and unreliable predictions when models
encounter out-of-distribution data, adversarial perturbations, or naturally
fluctuating environments. This thesis, titled Epistemic Deep Learning: Enabling
Machine Learning Models to 'Know When They Do Not Know', addresses these
critical challenges by advancing the paradigm of Epistemic Artificial
Intelligence, which explicitly models and quantifies epistemic uncertainty: the
uncertainty arising from limited, biased, or incomplete training data, as
opposed to the irreducible randomness of aleatoric uncertainty, thereby
empowering models to acknowledge their limitations and refrain from
overconfident decisions when uncertainty is high.
  Central to this work is the development of the Random-Set Neural Network
(RS-NN), a novel methodology that leverages random set theory to predict belief
functions over sets of classes, capturing the extent of epistemic uncertainty
through the width of associated credal sets, applications of RS-NN, including
its adaptation to Large Language Models (LLMs) and its deployment in weather
classification for autonomous racing. In addition, the thesis proposes a
unified evaluation framework for uncertainty-aware classifiers. Extensive
experiments validate that integrating epistemic awareness into deep learning
not only mitigates the risks associated with overconfident predictions but also
lays the foundation for a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where the
ability to 'know when it does not know' becomes a hallmark of robust and
dependable systems. The title encapsulates the core philosophy of this work,
emphasizing that true intelligence involves recognizing and managing the limits
of one's own knowledge.

Conclusion: 学业表现是系统性现象，与学校生态系统密切相关，研究为促进教育公平提供了数据支持。

Abstract: Identifying the factors that influence student performance in basic education
is a central challenge for formulating effective public policies in Brazil.
This study introduces a multi-level machine learning approach to classify the
proficiency of 9th-grade and high school students using microdata from the
System of Assessment of Basic Education (SAEB). Our model uniquely integrates
four data sources: student socioeconomic characteristics, teacher professional
profiles, school indicators, and director management profiles. A comparative
analysis of four ensemble algorithms confirmed the superiority of a Random
Forest model, which achieved 90.2% accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC)
of 96.7%. To move beyond prediction, we applied Explainable AI (XAI) using
SHAP, which revealed that the school's average socioeconomic level is the most
dominant predictor, demonstrating that systemic factors have a greater impact
than individual characteristics in isolation. The primary conclusion is that
academic performance is a systemic phenomenon deeply tied to the school's
ecosystem. This study provides a data-driven, interpretable tool to inform
policies aimed at promoting educational equity by addressing disparities
between schools.

Conclusion: ATLAS的模块化设计无需微调，且认知地图、分层规划和前瞻重规划对其性能至关重要。

Abstract: We observe that current state-of-the-art web-agents are unable to effectively
adapt to new environments without neural network fine-tuning, without which
they produce inefficient execution plans due to a lack of awareness of the
structure and dynamics of the new environment. To address this limitation, we
introduce ATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action
Simulation), a memory-augmented agent that is able to make plans grounded in a
model of the environment by simulating the consequences of those actions in
cognitive space. Our agent starts by building a "cognitive map" by performing a
lightweight curiosity driven exploration of the environment. The planner
proposes candidate actions; the simulator predicts their consequences in
cognitive space; a critic analyzes the options to select the best roll-out and
update the original plan; and a browser executor performs the chosen action. On
the WebArena-Lite Benchmark, we achieve a 63% success rate compared to 53.9%
success rate for the previously published state-of-the-art. Unlike previous
systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning.
Ablations show sizable drops without the world-model, hierarchical planner, and
look-ahead-based replanner confirming their complementary roles within the
design of our system

Method: 利用750户家庭的面板数据，结合社会经济属性、宏观经济指标和数字经济指标，通过数据预处理和特征工程，使用多种机器学习模型进行预测。

Result: 数字经济的特征显著提升了预测准确性，系统在二元和多分类任务中表现可靠，关键预测因子包括通胀波动和ICT需求。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了透明且可解释的机器学习方法在实时预警家庭财务困境中的可行性和影响力，为政策制定者提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: The growing instability of both global and domestic economic environments has
increased the risk of financial distress at the household level. However,
traditional econometric models often rely on delayed and aggregated data,
limiting their effectiveness. This study introduces a machine learning-based
early warning system that utilizes real-time digital and macroeconomic signals
to identify financial distress in near real-time. Using a panel dataset of 750
households tracked over three monitoring rounds spanning 13 months, the
framework combines socioeconomic attributes, macroeconomic indicators (such as
GDP growth, inflation, and foreign exchange fluctuations), and digital economy
measures (including ICT demand and market volatility). Through data
preprocessing and feature engineering, we introduce lagged variables,
volatility measures, and interaction terms to capture both gradual and sudden
changes in financial stability. We benchmark baseline classifiers, such as
logistic regression and decision trees, against advanced ensemble models
including random forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM. Our results indicate that the
engineered features from the digital economy significantly enhance predictive
accuracy. The system performs reliably for both binary distress detection and
multi-class severity classification, with SHAP-based explanations identifying
inflation volatility and ICT demand as key predictors. Crucially, the framework
is designed for scalable deployment in national agencies and low-bandwidth
regional offices, ensuring it is accessible for policymakers and practitioners.
By implementing machine learning in a transparent and interpretable manner,
this study demonstrates the feasibility and impact of providing near-real-time
early warnings of financial distress. This offers actionable insights that can
strengthen household resilience and guide preemptive intervention strategies.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于同质性的测试时图结构转换方法GrapHoST，通过调整测试图的同质性来提高预训练GNN模型的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中测试图常因数据质量问题和分布偏移导致性能下降，现有方法主要关注训练图，忽略了测试时的结构优化。

Method: 开发同质性预测器，根据预测的同质性分数自适应调整测试图结构，无需模型训练或更新。

Result: 在多种测试时数据质量问题下，GrapHoST在九个基准数据集上表现优异，性能提升高达10.92%。

Conclusion: 通过调整测试图的同质性，GrapHoST显著提升了预训练GNN模型的鲁棒性和性能，适用于多种现实场景。

Abstract: Homophily, the tendency of nodes from the same class to connect, is a
fundamental property of real-world graphs, underpinning structural and semantic
patterns in domains such as citation networks and social networks. Existing
methods exploit homophily through designing homophily-aware GNN architectures
or graph structure learning strategies, yet they primarily focus on GNN
learning with training graphs. However, in real-world scenarios, test graphs
often suffer from data quality issues and distribution shifts, such as domain
shifts across users from different regions in social networks and temporal
evolution shifts in citation network graphs collected over varying time
periods. These factors significantly compromise the pre-trained model's
robustness, resulting in degraded test-time performance. With empirical
observations and theoretical analysis, we reveal that transforming the test
graph structure by increasing homophily in homophilic graphs or decreasing it
in heterophilic graphs can significantly improve the robustness and performance
of pre-trained GNNs on node classifications, without requiring model training
or update. Motivated by these insights, a novel test-time graph structural
transformation method grounded in homophily, named GrapHoST, is proposed.
Specifically, a homophily predictor is developed to discriminate test edges,
facilitating adaptive test-time graph structural transformation by the
confidence of predicted homophily scores. Extensive experiments on nine
benchmark datasets under a range of test-time data quality issues demonstrate
that GrapHoST consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, with
improvements of up to 10.92%. Our code has been released at

TL;DR: 开发了一个公平、可解释的MASLD预测模型MASER，性能与现有方法相当，并减少了种族和民族间的预测差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MASLD影响广泛且早期干预有效，但现有预测模型可能存在公平性问题，因此需要开发公平且性能良好的模型。

Method: 使用LASSO逻辑回归、随机森林、XGBoost和神经网络，结合SHAP特征选择和公平性后处理方法。

Result: LASSO逻辑回归模型在AUROC为0.84，准确率78%，公平性调整后准确率提升至81%，但敏感性下降。

Conclusion: MASER模型在性能和公平性之间取得了平衡，适用于多样化患者群体。

Abstract: Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)
affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease.
Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection
is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We
developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and
compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.
  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and
a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including
the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates
across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity
postprocessing method.
  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in
the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic
regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability
and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved
AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and
F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly
increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and
F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.
  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk
Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive
performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to
previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach
demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive
performance and fairness in diverse patient populations.

Result: 模型在33项指标上表现优异（AUC>0.65），59项中等（0.55-0.65），16项较差（<0.55）。

Conclusion: 研究证实了非侵入性实时实验室指标预测的可行性，为AI驱动解决方案提供了基础。

Abstract: Timely access to laboratory values is critical for clinical decision-making,
yet current approaches rely on invasive venous sampling and are intrinsically
delayed. Electrocardiography (ECG), as a non-invasive and widely available
signal, offers a promising modality for rapid laboratory estimation. Recent
progress in deep learning has enabled the extraction of latent hematological
signatures from ECGs. However, existing models are constrained by low
signal-to-noise ratios, substantial inter-individual variability, limited data
diversity, and suboptimal generalization, especially when adapted to low-lead
wearable devices. In this work, we conduct an exploratory study leveraging
transfer learning to fine-tune ECGFounder, a large-scale pre-trained ECG
foundation model, on the Multimodal Clinical Monitoring in the Emergency
Department (MC-MED) dataset from Stanford. We generated a corpus of more than
20 million standardized ten-second ECG segments to enhance sensitivity to
subtle biochemical correlates. On internal validation, the model demonstrated
strong predictive performance (area under the curve above 0.65) for
thirty-three laboratory indicators, moderate performance (between 0.55 and
0.65) for fifty-nine indicators, and limited performance (below 0.55) for
sixteen indicators. This study provides an efficient artificial-intelligence
driven solution and establishes the feasibility scope for real-time,
non-invasive estimation of laboratory values.

Result: 生成的材料超出传统组成范围，表现优于基准方法。

Conclusion: LLMs可作为可解释的、专家级的假设生成器，推动科学创新。

Abstract: Analogical reasoning, the transfer of relational structures across contexts
(e.g., planet is to sun as electron is to nucleus), is fundamental to
scientific discovery. Yet human insight is often constrained by domain
expertise and surface-level biases, limiting access to deeper, structure-driven
analogies both within and across disciplines. Large language models (LLMs),
trained on vast cross-domain data, present a promising yet underexplored tool
for analogical reasoning in science. Here, we demonstrate that LLMs can
generate novel battery materials by (1) retrieving cross-domain analogs and
analogy-guided exemplars to steer exploration beyond conventional dopant
substitutions, and (2) constructing in-domain analogical templates from few
labeled examples to guide targeted exploitation. These explicit analogical
reasoning strategies yield candidates outside established compositional spaces
and outperform standard prompting baselines. Our findings position LLMs as
interpretable, expert-like hypothesis generators that leverage analogy-driven
generalization for scientific innovation.

Method: 使用时间序列预测方法（包括TSFMs）预测状态，仅在预测不确定性高时查询。分析了贪婪策略的性能，并提出PSGD学习变体。

Result: 贪婪策略在常见条件下接近最优（OPT），但在一般情况下可能表现不佳。PSGD变体在未知转移概率下表现良好。

Conclusion: 贪婪策略在特定条件下有效，PSGD变体进一步优化了计算效率和性能。

Abstract: We consider a node-monitor pair, where the node's state varies with time. The
monitor needs to track the node's state at all times; however, there is a fixed
cost for each state query. So the monitor may instead predict the state using
time-series forecasting methods, including time-series foundation models
(TSFMs), and query only when prediction uncertainty is high. Since query
decisions influence prediction accuracy, determining when to query is
nontrivial. A natural approach is a greedy policy that predicts when the
expected prediction loss is below the query cost and queries otherwise. We
analyze this policy in a Markovian setting, where the optimal (OPT) strategy is
a state-dependent threshold policy minimizing the time-averaged sum of query
cost and prediction losses. We show that, in general, the greedy policy is
suboptimal and can have an unbounded competitive ratio, but under common
conditions such as identically distributed transition probabilities, it
performs close to OPT. For the case of unknown transition probabilities, we
further propose a projected stochastic gradient descent (PSGD)-based learning
variant of the greedy policy, which achieves a favorable predict-query tradeoff
with improved computational efficiency compared to OPT.

Result: SAEs和FFs在可解释性上表现相似，SAEs在某些方面略有优势，但FFs在某些情况下表现更好。两者发现的特征存在差异。

Conclusion: SAEs在特征质量和忠实性上的优势受到质疑，前馈层（FFs）的参数可作为现代可解释性研究的强基线。

Abstract: Recent interpretability work on large language models (LLMs) has been
increasingly dominated by a feature-discovery approach with the help of proxy
modules. Then, the quality of features learned by, e.g., sparse auto-encoders
(SAEs), is evaluated. This paradigm naturally raises a critical question: do
such learned features have better properties than those already represented
within the original model parameters, and unfortunately, only a few studies
have made such comparisons systematically so far. In this work, we revisit the
interpretability of feature vectors stored in feed-forward (FF) layers, given
the perspective of FF as key-value memories, with modern interpretability
benchmarks. Our extensive evaluation revealed that SAE and FFs exhibits a
similar range of interpretability, although SAEs displayed an observable but
minimal improvement in some aspects. Furthermore, in certain aspects,
surprisingly, even vanilla FFs yielded better interpretability than the SAEs,
and features discovered in SAEs and FFs diverged. These bring questions about
the advantage of SAEs from both perspectives of feature quality and
faithfulness, compared to directly interpreting FF feature vectors, and FF
key-value parameters serve as a strong baseline in modern interpretability
research.

Result: 框架在各项同性和各向异性实验数据以及线性和非线性模型库中均表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法无需先验选择，能处理非线性模型，并提供了灵活的参数分布和可解释性。

Abstract: Constitutive model discovery refers to the task of identifying an appropriate
model structure, usually from a predefined model library, while simultaneously
inferring its material parameters. The data used for model discovery are
measured in mechanical tests and are thus inevitably affected by noise which,
in turn, induces uncertainties. Previously proposed methods for uncertainty
quantification in model discovery either require the selection of a prior for
the material parameters, are restricted to the linear coefficients of the model
library or are limited in the flexibility of the inferred parameter probability
distribution. We therefore propose a four-step partially Bayesian framework for
uncertainty quantification in model discovery that does not require prior
selection for the material parameters and also allows for the discovery of
non-linear constitutive models: First, we augment the available
stress-deformation data with a Gaussian process. Second, we approximate the
parameter distribution by a normalizing flow, which allows for capturing
complex joint distributions. Third, we distill the parameter distribution by
matching the distribution of stress-deformation functions induced by the
parameters with the Gaussian process posterior. Fourth, we perform a Sobol'
sensitivity analysis to obtain a sparse and interpretable model. We demonstrate
the capability of our framework for both isotropic and anisotropic experimental
data as well as linear and non-linear model libraries.

Motivation: 现有Chain-of-thought（CoT）推理痕迹可能不忠实反映模型内部计算，导致误解。

Method: Concept Walk在激活空间中将推理步骤投影到概念方向，分析内部动态。

Result: 在简单案例中，扰动CoT被忽略（装饰性推理）；在复杂案例中，扰动导致持续激活变化（忠实推理）。

Conclusion: Concept Walk为评估推理痕迹的忠实性提供新方法，帮助判断其可信度。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) traces promise transparency for reasoning language
models, but prior work shows they are not always faithful reflections of
internal computation. This raises challenges for oversight: practitioners may
misinterpret decorative reasoning as genuine. We introduce Concept Walk, a
general framework for tracing how a model's internal stance evolves with
respect to a concept direction during reasoning. Unlike surface text, Concept
Walk operates in activation space, projecting each reasoning step onto the
concept direction learned from contrastive data. This allows us to observe
whether reasoning traces shape outcomes or are discarded. As a case study, we
apply Concept Walk to the domain of Safety using Qwen 3-4B. We find that in
'easy' cases, perturbed CoTs are quickly ignored, indicating decorative
reasoning, whereas in 'hard' cases, perturbations induce sustained shifts in
internal activations, consistent with faithful reasoning. The contribution is
methodological: Concept Walk provides a lens to re-examine faithfulness through
concept-specific internal dynamics, helping identify when reasoning traces can
be trusted and when they risk misleading practitioners.

TL;DR: FairGround是一个统一的框架、数据语料库和Python包，旨在促进公平机器学习分类的可重复研究和关键数据研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平ML研究依赖的数据集选择狭窄、处理不一致且缺乏多样性，影响了结果的普适性和可重复性。

Method: FairGround包含44个表格数据集，每个数据集都标注了丰富的公平性相关元数据，并提供了标准化的Python工具包。

Result: FairGround通过提供多样化和文档齐全的数据集及工具，支持开发更公平、可靠和可重复的ML模型。

Conclusion: FairGround为开放和协作研究提供了公开资源，推动了公平ML领域的发展。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) systems are increasingly adopted in high-stakes
decision-making domains, ensuring fairness in their outputs has become a
central challenge. At the core of fair ML research are the datasets used to
investigate bias and develop mitigation strategies. Yet, much of the existing
work relies on a narrow selection of datasets--often arbitrarily chosen,
inconsistently processed, and lacking in diversity--undermining the
generalizability and reproducibility of results.
  To address these limitations, we present FairGround: a unified framework,
data corpus, and Python package aimed at advancing reproducible research and
critical data studies in fair ML classification. FairGround currently comprises
44 tabular datasets, each annotated with rich fairness-relevant metadata. Our
accompanying Python package standardizes dataset loading, preprocessing,
transformation, and splitting, streamlining experimental workflows. By
providing a diverse and well-documented dataset corpus along with robust
tooling, FairGround enables the development of fairer, more reliable, and more
reproducible ML models. All resources are publicly available to support open
and collaborative research.

### [371] [Label Smoothing Improves Gradient Ascent in LLM Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22376)
*Zirui Pang,Hao Zheng,Zhijie Deng,Ling Li,Zixin Zhong,Jiaheng Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SGA（平滑梯度上升）是一种改进的LLM遗忘方法，通过结合遗忘数据和正常数据，解决了传统GA（梯度上升）的不稳定性问题，并在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统梯度上升（GA）方法在LLM遗忘中存在严重的不稳定性问题，导致模型性能大幅下降。因此，提出SGA以更稳定地实现遗忘，同时保留模型效用。

Method: SGA通过将遗忘数据与多个构造的正常数据结合，通过可调平滑率进行联合学习，从而稳定更新方向。

Result: 在TOFU、Harry Potter和MUSE-NEWS三个基准测试中，SGA在所有指标上均优于GA，并在多个关键指标上达到前两名。

Conclusion: SGA是一种高效且稳定的LLM遗忘方法，能够显著提升模型遗忘效果，同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: LLM unlearning has emerged as a promising approach, aiming to enable models
to forget hazardous/undesired knowledge at low cost while preserving as much
model utility as possible. Among existing techniques, the most straightforward
method is performing Gradient Ascent (GA) w.r.t. the forget data, thereby
forcing the model to unlearn the forget dataset. However, GA suffers from
severe instability, as it drives updates in a divergent direction, often
resulting in drastically degraded model utility. To address this issue, we
propose Smoothed Gradient Ascent (SGA). SGA combines the forget data with
multiple constructed normal data through a tunable smoothing rate. Intuitively,
this extends GA from learning solely on the forget data to jointly learning
across both forget and normal data, enabling more stable unlearning while
better preserving model utility. Theoretically, we provide the theoretical
guidance on the selection of the optimal smoothing rate. Empirically, we
evaluate SGA on three benchmarks: TOFU, Harry Potter, and MUSE-NEWS.
Experimental results demonstrate that SGA consistently outperforms the original
Gradient Ascent (GA) method across all metrics and achieves top-2 performance
among all baseline methods on several key metrics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 用康威生命游戏（GoL）替代传统Dropout，提出动态单元失活方法，提升神经网络泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Dropout存在静态性和缺乏可解释性的局限，需改进。

Method: 将神经网络单元视为GoL网格中的细胞，应用其规则动态失活单元。

Result: 在CIFAR-10上表现与传统Dropout相当，且能可视化动态模式。

Conclusion: GoL动态失活方法有效，适用于更深层架构，增强性能与可解释性。

Abstract: Regularization techniques play a crucial role in preventing overfitting and
improving the generalization performance of neural networks. Dropout, a widely
used regularization technique, randomly deactivates units during training to
introduce redundancy and prevent co-adaptation among neurons. Despite its
effectiveness, dropout has limitations, such as its static nature and lack of
interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to regularization
by substituting dropout with Conway's Game of Life (GoL), a cellular automata
with simple rules that govern the evolution of a grid of cells. We introduce
dynamic unit deactivation during training by representing neural network units
as cells in a GoL grid and applying the game's rules to deactivate units. This
approach allows for the emergence of spatial patterns that adapt to the
training data, potentially enhancing the network's ability to generalize. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the CIFAR-10 dataset, showing
that dynamic unit deactivation using GoL achieves comparable performance to
traditional dropout techniques while offering insights into the network's
behavior through the visualization of evolving patterns. Furthermore, our
discussion highlights the applicability of our proposal in deeper
architectures, demonstrating how it enhances the performance of different
dropout techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线平台用户行为随时间变化，导致模型性能下降。传统微调方法易引发灾难性遗忘，而回放式方法受限于缓冲区大小。

Method: 结合外部知识库进行数据增强，改进回放式持续学习框架，评估了多种策略。

Result: 在异常行为分类任务中，增强方法优于基线回放式方法。

Conclusion: 数据增强能有效提升持续学习性能，克服缓冲区限制。

Abstract: User behavior on online platforms is evolving, reflecting real-world changes
in how people post, whether it's helpful messages or hate speech. Models that
learn to capture this content can experience a decrease in performance over
time due to data drift, which can lead to ineffective behavioral analytics
systems. However, fine-tuning such a model over time with new data can be
detrimental due to catastrophic forgetting. Replay-based approaches in
continual learning offer a simple yet efficient method to update such models,
minimizing forgetting by maintaining a buffer of important training instances
from past learned tasks. However, the main limitation of this approach is the
fixed size of the buffer. External knowledge bases can be utilized to overcome
this limitation through data augmentation. We propose a novel
augmentation-based approach to incorporate external knowledge in the
replay-based continual learning framework. We evaluate several strategies with
three datasets from prior studies related to deviant behavior classification to
assess the integration of external knowledge in continual learning and
demonstrate that augmentation helps outperform baseline replay-based
approaches.

Motivation: 研究在流式数据中如何通过低精度量化实现高效的主成分分析，以降低计算和存储成本。

Method: 使用Oja算法，结合线性和非线性随机量化方法，对权重向量和更新进行无偏量化。

Result: 理论证明量化方法接近信息论下界，非线性量化下误差几乎与维度无关，实验验证了其与标准Oja算法性能接近。

Conclusion: 低精度流式PCA在理论和实践中均表现良好，适用于资源受限的场景。

Abstract: Low-precision streaming PCA estimates the top principal component in a
streaming setting under limited precision. We establish an
information-theoretic lower bound on the quantization resolution required to
achieve a target accuracy for the leading eigenvector. We study Oja's algorithm
for streaming PCA under linear and nonlinear stochastic quantization. The
quantized variants use unbiased stochastic quantization of the weight vector
and the updates. Under mild moment and spectral-gap assumptions on the data
distribution, we show that a batched version achieves the lower bound up to
logarithmic factors under both schemes. This leads to a nearly dimension-free
quantization error in the nonlinear quantization setting. Empirical evaluations
on synthetic streams validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that our
low-precision methods closely track the performance of standard Oja's
algorithm.

TL;DR: SmartMixed是一种两阶段训练策略，允许网络学习每个神经元的最佳激活函数，同时保持推理时的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络通常使用固定、统一的激活函数，限制了网络的表达能力。SmartMixed旨在通过学习每个神经元的最优激活函数来提升性能。

Method: SmartMixed分为两阶段：第一阶段通过可微分硬混合机制从候选池中选择激活函数；第二阶段固定选择以实现高效推理。

Result: 在MNIST数据集上，不同层的神经元表现出对激活函数的偏好差异，揭示了神经架构中的功能多样性。

Conclusion: SmartMixed通过动态学习激活函数提升了网络性能，同时保持了计算效率。

Abstract: The choice of activation function plays a critical role in neural networks,
yet most architectures still rely on fixed, uniform activation functions across
all neurons. We introduce SmartMixed, a two-phase training strategy that allows
networks to learn optimal per-neuron activation functions while preserving
computational efficiency at inference. In the first phase, neurons adaptively
select from a pool of candidate activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh,
Leaky ReLU, ELU, SELU) using a differentiable hard-mixture mechanism. In the
second phase, each neuron's activation function is fixed according to the
learned selection, resulting in a computationally efficient network that
supports continued training with optimized vectorized operations. We evaluate
SmartMixed on the MNIST dataset using feedforward neural networks of varying
depths. The analysis shows that neurons in different layers exhibit distinct
preferences for activation functions, providing insights into the functional
diversity within neural architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图提示方法主要关注特征导向，忽略了拓扑导向的潜力，导致性能不佳。

Method: 将拓扑导向提示重新定义为多跳局部子图中的边重连问题，并通过重新参数化将其松弛到连续概率空间。

Result: 在五个图数据集和四种预训练策略下，GraphTOP在多个节点分类数据集上优于六个基线方法。

Conclusion: GraphTOP通过拓扑导向提示显著提升了预训练GNN模型的适应能力，为图学习领域提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the field of graph learning
by learning expressive graph representations from massive graph data. As a
common pattern to train powerful GNNs, the "pre-training, adaptation" scheme
first pre-trains GNNs over unlabeled graph data and subsequently adapts them to
specific downstream tasks. In the adaptation phase, graph prompting is an
effective strategy that modifies input graph data with learnable prompts while
keeping pre-trained GNN models frozen. Typically, existing graph prompting
studies mainly focus on *feature-oriented* methods that apply graph prompts to
node features or hidden representations. However, these studies often achieve
suboptimal performance, as they consistently overlook the potential of
*topology-oriented* prompting, which adapts pre-trained GNNs by modifying the
graph topology. In this study, we conduct a pioneering investigation of graph
prompting in terms of graph topology. We propose the first **Graph**
**T**opology-**O**riented **P**rompting (GraphTOP) framework to effectively
adapt pre-trained GNN models for downstream tasks. More specifically, we
reformulate topology-oriented prompting as an edge rewiring problem within
multi-hop local subgraphs and relax it into the continuous probability space
through reparameterization while ensuring tight relaxation and preserving graph
sparsity. Extensive experiments on five graph datasets under four pre-training
strategies demonstrate that our proposed GraphTOP outshines six baselines on
multiple node classification datasets. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GradLite是一种内存高效的优化器，通过近似梯度和误差反馈技术减少训练LLMs时的内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统优化器需要精确梯度，导致内存消耗大，现有解决方案未触及优化器本身。

Method: 采用低秩Jacobian近似和误差反馈校正技术。

Result: 内存消耗减少50%，性能与现有方法相当或更优。

Conclusion: GradLite在保持收敛性的同时显著降低了内存需求。

Abstract: Full fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is notoriously
memory-intensive, primarily because conventional optimizers such as SGD or Adam
assume access to exact gradients derived from cached activations. Existing
solutions either alter the model architecture (e.g., reversible networks) or
trade memory for computation (e.g., activation checkpointing), but the
optimizer itself remains untouched. In this work, we introduce GradLite, a
backward-friendly optimizer that relaxes the requirement of exact gradients,
enabling efficient training even when intermediate activations are aggressively
discarded or approximated. GradLite leverages two key techniques: (i) low-rank
Jacobian approximation, which reduces the dimensionality of backpropagated
error signals, and (ii) error-feedback correction, which accumulates and
compensates approximation errors across iterations to preserve convergence
guarantees. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that GradLite maintains
unbiased gradient estimates with bounded variance, ensuring convergence rates
comparable to Adam. Empirically, GradLite reduces optimizer-state and
activation memory consumption by up to 50\% without architectural changes, and
achieves on-par or superior downstream performance on reasoning (MMLU, GSM8K),
multilingual, and dialogue benchmarks compared to checkpointing and
optimizer-centric baselines (LoMo, GaLore).

Result: 实验表明CORGII在准确性和效率之间提供了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: CORGII首次实现了密集图表示的离散令牌映射，显著提升了检索效率。

Abstract: Retrieving graphs from a large corpus, that contain a subgraph isomorphic to
a given query graph, is a core operation in many real-world applications. While
recent multi-vector graph representations and scores based on set alignment and
containment can provide accurate subgraph isomorphism tests, their use in
retrieval remains limited by their need to score corpus graphs exhaustively. We
introduce CORGII (Contextual Representation of Graphs for Inverted Indexing), a
graph indexing framework in which, starting with a contextual dense graph
representation, a differentiable discretization module computes sparse binary
codes over a learned latent vocabulary. This text document-like representation
allows us to leverage classic, highly optimized inverted indices, while
supporting soft (vector) set containment scores. Pushing this paradigm further,
we replace the classical, fixed impact weight of a `token' on a graph (such as
TFIDF or BM25) with a data-driven, trainable impact weight. Finally, we explore
token expansion to support multi-probing the index for smoother
accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. To our knowledge, CORGII is the first indexer of
dense graph representations using discrete tokens mapping to efficient inverted
lists. Extensive experiments show that CORGII provides better trade-offs
between accuracy and efficiency, compared to several baselines.

Motivation: 当前方法依赖大数据集且难以控制泛化性，LAMP旨在解决这些问题。

Method: LAMP通过共享初始化对齐SDF解码器，并在对齐权重空间中解决参数约束混合问题。

Result: LAMP在少量样本下实现可控插值、安全外推和物理性能优化，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: LAMP为设计探索和性能驱动优化提供了可控、数据高效且安全的3D生成方法。

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity 3D geometries that satisfy specific parameter
constraints has broad applications in design and engineering. However, current
methods typically rely on large training datasets and struggle with
controllability and generalization beyond the training distributions. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce LAMP (Linear Affine Mixing of
Parametric shapes), a data-efficient framework for controllable and
interpretable 3D generation. LAMP first aligns signed distance function (SDF)
decoders by overfitting each exemplar from a shared initialization, then
synthesizes new geometries by solving a parameter-constrained mixing problem in
the aligned weight space. To ensure robustness, we further propose a safety
metric that detects geometry validity via linearity mismatch. We evaluate LAMP
on two 3D parametric benchmarks: DrivAerNet++ and BlendedNet. We found that
LAMP enables (i) controlled interpolation within bounds with as few as 100
samples, (ii) safe extrapolation by up to 100% parameter difference beyond
training ranges, (iii) physics performance-guided optimization under fixed
parameters. LAMP significantly outperforms conditional autoencoder and Deep
Network Interpolation (DNI) baselines in both extrapolation and data
efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LAMP advances controllable,
data-efficient, and safe 3D generation for design exploration, dataset
generation, and performance-driven optimization.

Motivation: 随着AI系统在多领域任务中超越人类专家，获取高质量人类监督变得困难。人类专家只能提供弱信号（如指出错误选项），而非完整评估。

Method: 利用互补标签构建无偏估计器，结合稀缺的真实标签和丰富的互补标签，提供有限样本偏差保证。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效评估大型语言模型输出，并训练出性能更好的AI系统。

Conclusion: 互补标签为AI系统的监督提供了一种可行且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems approach and surpass expert human
performance across a broad range of tasks, obtaining high-quality human
supervision for evaluation and training becomes increasingly challenging. Our
focus is on tasks that require deep knowledge and skills of multiple domains.
Unfortunately, even the best human experts are knowledgeable only in a single
narrow area, and will not be able to evaluate the correctness of advanced AI
systems on such superhuman tasks. However, based on their narrow expertise,
humans may provide a weak signal, i.e., a complementary label indicating an
option that is incorrect. For example, a cardiologist could state that "this is
not related to cardiology,'' even if they cannot identify the true disease.
Based on this weak signal, we propose a scalable oversight framework that
enables us to evaluate frontier AI systems without the need to prepare the
ground truth. We derive an unbiased estimator of top-1 accuracy from
complementary labels and quantify how many complementary labels are needed to
match the variance of ordinary labels. We further introduce two estimators to
combine scarce ordinary labels with abundant complementary labels. We provide
finite-sample deviation guarantees for both complementary-only and the mixed
estimators. Empirically, we show that we can evaluate the output of large
language models without the ground truth, if we have complementary labels. We
further show that we can train an AI system with such weak signals: we show how
we can design an agentic AI system automatically that can perform better with
this partitioned human supervision. Our code is available at

Abstract: Materials discovery requires navigating vast chemical and structural spaces
while satisfying multiple, often conflicting, objectives. We present LLM-guided
Evolution for MAterials design (LLEMA), a unified framework that couples the
scientific knowledge embedded in large language models with chemistry-informed
evolutionary rules and memory-based refinement. At each iteration, an LLM
proposes crystallographically specified candidates under explicit property
constraints; a surrogate-augmented oracle estimates physicochemical properties;
and a multi-objective scorer updates success/failure memories to guide
subsequent generations. Evaluated on 14 realistic tasks spanning electronics,
energy, coatings, optics, and aerospace, LLEMA discovers candidates that are
chemically plausible, thermodynamically stable, and property-aligned, achieving
higher hit-rates and stronger Pareto fronts than generative and LLM-only
baselines. Ablation studies confirm the importance of rule-guided generation,
memory-based refinement, and surrogate prediction. By enforcing
synthesizability and multi-objective trade-offs, LLEMA delivers a principled
pathway to accelerate practical materials discovery.

Result: CANDI在控制生成和文本生成任务中表现优于纯离散方法，展示了连续梯度学习的价值。

Conclusion: CANDI成功解决了连续扩散在离散数据上的局限性，为离散空间的学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: While continuous diffusion has shown remarkable success in continuous domains
such as image generation, its direct application to discrete data has
underperformed compared to purely discrete formulations. This gap is
counterintuitive, given that continuous diffusion learns score functions that
enable joint evolution across multiple positions. To understand this gap, we
introduce token identifiability as an analytical framework for understanding
how Gaussian noise corrupts discrete data through two mechanisms: discrete
identity corruption and continuous rank degradation. We reveal that these
mechanisms scale differently with vocabulary size, creating a temporal
dissonance: at noise levels where discrete corruption preserves enough
structure for conditional learning, continuous denoising is trivial; at noise
levels where continuous denoising is meaningful, discrete corruption destroys
nearly all conditional structure. To solve this, we propose CANDI (Continuous
ANd DIscrete diffusion), a hybrid framework that decouples discrete and
continuous corruption, enabling simultaneous learning of both conditional
structure and continuous geometry. We empirically validate the temporal
dissonance phenomenon and demonstrate that CANDI successfully avoids it. This
unlocks the benefits of continuous diffusion for discrete spaces: on controlled
generation, CANDI enables classifier-based guidance with off-the-shelf
classifiers through simple gradient addition; on text generation, CANDI
outperforms masked diffusion at low NFE, demonstrating the value of learning
continuous gradients for discrete spaces.

Result: 在长轨迹基准任务中表现优于现有离线GCRL算法。

Conclusion: TRL通过分治策略有效提升了离线GCRL的性能，减少了偏差和方差。

Abstract: In this work, we present Transitive Reinforcement Learning (TRL), a new value
learning algorithm based on a divide-and-conquer paradigm. TRL is designed for
offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) problems, where the aim
is to find a policy that can reach any state from any other state in the
smallest number of steps. TRL converts a triangle inequality structure present
in GCRL into a practical divide-and-conquer value update rule. This has several
advantages compared to alternative value learning paradigms. Compared to
temporal difference (TD) methods, TRL suffers less from bias accumulation, as
in principle it only requires $O(\log T)$ recursions (as opposed to $O(T)$ in
TD learning) to handle a length-$T$ trajectory. Unlike Monte Carlo methods, TRL
suffers less from high variance as it performs dynamic programming.
Experimentally, we show that TRL achieves the best performance in highly
challenging, long-horizon benchmark tasks compared to previous offline GCRL
algorithms.

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，RIDGE显著提升SGNN在不同噪声水平下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RIDGE为SGNN提供理论指导的鲁棒性解决方案，有效应对输入和目标噪声。

Abstract: Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) are widely adopted to analyze complex
patterns in signed graphs with both positive and negative links. Given the
noisy nature of real-world connections, the robustness of SGNN has also emerged
as a pivotal research area. Under the supervision of empirical properties,
graph structure learning has shown its robustness on signed graph
representation learning, however, there remains a paucity of research
investigating a robust SGNN with theoretical guidance. Inspired by the success
of graph information bottleneck (GIB) in information extraction, we propose
RIDGE, a novel framework for Robust sI gned graph learning through joint
Denoising of Graph inputs and supervision targEts. Different from the basic
GIB, we extend the GIB theory with the capability of target space denoising as
the co-existence of noise in both input and target spaces. In instantiation,
RIDGE effectively cleanses input data and supervision targets via a tractable
objective function produced by reparameterization mechanism and variational
approximation. We extensively validate our method on four prevalent signed
graph datasets, and the results show that RIDGE clearly improves the robustness
of popular SGNN models under various levels of noise.

Conclusion: SDC-GBB在保证全局最优性的同时，显著提升了约束聚类的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Constrained clustering leverages limited domain knowledge to improve
clustering performance and interpretability, but incorporating pairwise
must-link and cannot-link constraints is an NP-hard challenge, making global
optimization intractable. Existing mixed-integer optimization methods are
confined to small-scale datasets, limiting their utility. We propose
Sample-Driven Constrained Group-Based Branch-and-Bound (SDC-GBB), a
decomposable branch-and-bound (BB) framework that collapses must-linked samples
into centroid-based pseudo-samples and prunes cannot-link through geometric
rules, while preserving convergence and guaranteeing global optimality. By
integrating grouped-sample Lagrangian decomposition and geometric elimination
rules for efficient lower and upper bounds, the algorithm attains highly
scalable pairwise k-Means constrained clustering via parallelism. Experimental
results show that our approach handles datasets with 200,000 samples with
cannot-link constraints and 1,500,000 samples with must-link constraints, which
is 200 - 1500 times larger than the current state-of-the-art under comparable
constraint settings, while reaching an optimality gap of less than 3%. In
providing deterministic global guarantees, our method also avoids the search
failures that off-the-shelf heuristics often encounter on large datasets.

TL;DR: RSNNs通过随机搜索替代随机游走，显著提高了稀疏图上的全局结构捕捉能力，并降低了采样复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RWNNs在有限采样下难以捕捉图的全局结构，限制了其表达能力。

Method: 提出RSNNs，利用随机搜索保证节点全覆盖，理论证明稀疏图中仅需O(log|V|)次搜索即可覆盖所有边。

Result: RSNNs在分子和蛋白质基准测试中表现优于RWNNs，采样序列减少16倍。

Conclusion: RSNNs为稀疏图学习提供了高效且表达能力强的框架。

Abstract: Random walk neural networks (RWNNs) have emerged as a promising approach for
graph representation learning, leveraging recent advances in sequence models to
process random walks. However, under realistic sampling constraints, RWNNs
often fail to capture global structure even in small graphs due to incomplete
node and edge coverage, limiting their expressivity. To address this, we
propose \textit{random search neural networks} (RSNNs), which operate on random
searches, each of which guarantees full node coverage. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that in sparse graphs, only $O(\log |V|)$ searches are needed to
achieve full edge coverage, substantially reducing sampling complexity compared
to the $O(|V|)$ walks required by RWNNs (assuming walk lengths scale with graph
size). Furthermore, when paired with universal sequence models, RSNNs are
universal approximators. We lastly show RSNNs are probabilistically invariant
to graph isomorphisms, ensuring their expectation is an isomorphism-invariant
graph function. Empirically, RSNNs consistently outperform RWNNs on molecular
and protein benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior performance with up to
16$\times$ fewer sampled sequences. Our work bridges theoretical and practical
advances in random walk based approaches, offering an efficient and expressive
framework for learning on sparse graphs.

TL;DR: IsoNet++是一种基于早期交互的图神经网络，通过多轮消息传递和节点对齐更新，显著提升了子图匹配的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统子图匹配方法（如IsoNet）独立计算图嵌入后再对齐，缺乏早期交互信息。IsoNet++旨在通过跨图消息传递和动态对齐优化解决这一问题。

Method: 1. 跨图消息传递；2. 多轮懒更新对齐；3. 引入节点对交互机制。

Result: 实验表明多轮对齐逐步优化，检索性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: IsoNet++的三项创新技术共同提升了子图匹配的准确性。

Abstract: Graph retrieval based on subgraph isomorphism has several real-world
applications such as scene graph retrieval, molecular fingerprint detection and
circuit design. Roy et al. [35] proposed IsoNet, a late interaction model for
subgraph matching, which first computes the node and edge embeddings of each
graph independently of paired graph and then computes a trainable alignment
map. Here, we present IsoNet++, an early interaction graph neural network
(GNN), based on several technical innovations. First, we compute embeddings of
all nodes by passing messages within and across the two input graphs, guided by
an injective alignment between their nodes. Second, we update this alignment in
a lazy fashion over multiple rounds. Within each round, we run a layerwise GNN
from scratch, based on the current state of the alignment. After the completion
of one round of GNN, we use the last-layer embeddings to update the alignments,
and proceed to the next round. Third, IsoNet++ incorporates a novel notion of
node-pair partner interaction. Traditional early interaction computes attention
between a node and its potential partners in the other graph, the attention
then controlling messages passed across graphs. In contrast, we consider node
pairs (not single nodes) as potential partners. Existence of an edge between
the nodes in one graph and non-existence in the other provide vital signals for
refining the alignment. Our experiments on several datasets show that the
alignments get progressively refined with successive rounds, resulting in
significantly better retrieval performance than existing methods. We
demonstrate that all three innovations contribute to the enhanced accuracy. Our
code and datasets are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的强化学习奖励机制会同等奖励有缺陷的推理轨迹（如猜测答案或跳跃推理），导致模型学习不可靠的推理模式。

Method: 提出了Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO)，通过参数无关的奖励惩罚机制，区分有缺陷和完全正确的推理轨迹。同时引入生成式奖励模型（GenRM）来精确检测推理错误。

Result: 实验表明，FAPO在多个领域有效，提高了结果的正确性、推理过程的可靠性以及训练的稳定性，且未增加计算成本。

Conclusion: FAPO通过动态调整对有缺陷推理轨迹的奖励，实现了早期快速提升和后期稳定优化的平衡，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language
models (LLMs). In this context, models explore reasoning trajectories and
exploit rollouts with correct answers as positive signals for policy
optimization. However, these rollouts might involve flawed patterns such as
answer-guessing and jump-in-reasoning. Such flawed-positive rollouts are
rewarded identically to fully correct ones, causing policy models to
internalize these unreliable reasoning patterns. In this work, we first conduct
a systematic study of flawed-positive rollouts in RL and find that they enable
rapid capability gains during the early optimization stage, while constraining
reasoning capability later by reinforcing unreliable patterns. Building on
these insights, we propose Flawed-Aware Policy Optimization (FAPO), which
presents a parameter-free reward penalty for flawed-positive rollouts, enabling
the policy to leverage them as useful shortcuts in the warm-up stage, securing
stable early gains, while gradually shifting optimization toward reliable
reasoning in the later refinement stage. To accurately and comprehensively
detect flawed-positive rollouts, we introduce a generative reward model (GenRM)
with a process-level reward that precisely localizes reasoning errors.
Experiments show that FAPO is effective in broad domains, improving outcome
correctness, process reliability, and training stability without increasing the
token budget.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在噪声水平高时表现优异，性能提升25%。

Conclusion: 该方法为随机轨迹恢复提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: With recent technological advances, process logs, which were traditionally
deterministic in nature, are being captured from non-deterministic sources,
such as uncertain sensors or machine learning models (that predict activities
using cameras). In the presence of stochastically-known logs, logs that contain
probabilistic information, the need for stochastic trace recovery increases, to
offer reliable means of understanding the processes that govern such systems.
We design a novel deep learning approach for stochastic trace recovery, based
on Diffusion Denoising Probabilistic Models (DDPM), which makes use of process
knowledge (either implicitly by discovering a model or explicitly by injecting
process knowledge in the training phase) to recover traces by denoising. We
conduct an empirical evaluation demonstrating state-of-the-art performance with
up to a 25% improvement over existing methods, along with increased robustness
under high noise levels.

Result: 算法实现了O(√t)的遗憾和Õ(√t)的累积约束违反界。

Conclusion: 算法在动态遗憾和乐观设置下表现优异，并通过数值实验验证了实用性。

Abstract: We propose an anytime online algorithm for the problem of learning a sequence
of adversarial convex cost functions while approximately satisfying another
sequence of adversarial online convex constraints. A sequential algorithm is
called \emph{anytime} if it provides a non-trivial performance guarantee for
any intermediate timestep $t$ without requiring prior knowledge of the length
of the entire time horizon $T$. Our proposed algorithm achieves optimal
performance bounds without resorting to the standard doubling trick, which has
poor practical performance due to multiple restarts. Our core technical
contribution is the use of time-varying Lyapunov functions to keep track of
constraint violations. This must be contrasted with prior works that used a
fixed Lyapunov function tuned to the known horizon length $T$. The use of
time-varying Lyapunov function poses unique analytical challenges as
properties, such as \emph{monotonicity}, on which the prior proofs rest, no
longer hold. By introducing a new analytical technique, we show that our
algorithm achieves $O(\sqrt{t})$ regret and $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{t})$ cumulative
constraint violation bounds for any $t\geq 1$.
  We extend our results to the dynamic regret setting, achieving bounds that
adapt to the path length of the comparator sequence without prior knowledge of
its total length. We also present an adaptive algorithm in the optimistic
setting, whose performance gracefully scales with the cumulative prediction
error. We demonstrate the practical utility of our algorithm through numerical
experiments involving the online shortest path problem.

Abstract: Prediction-Powered Inference (PPI) is a recently proposed statistical
inference technique for parameter estimation that leverages pseudo-labels on
both labeled and unlabeled data to construct an unbiased, low-variance
estimator. In this work, we extend its core idea to semi-supervised learning
(SSL) for model training, introducing a novel unbiased gradient estimator. This
extension addresses a key challenge in SSL: while unlabeled data can improve
model performance, its benefit heavily depends on the quality of pseudo-labels.
Inaccurate pseudo-labels can introduce bias, leading to suboptimal models.To
balance the contributions of labeled and pseudo-labeled data, we utilize an
interpolation parameter and tune it on the fly, alongside the model parameters,
using a one-dimensional online learning algorithm. We verify the practical
advantage of our approach through experiments on both synthetic and real
datasets, demonstrating improved performance over classic SSL baselines and PPI
methods that tune the interpolation parameter offline.

Abstract: Geometric data analysis and learning has emerged as a distinct and rapidly
developing research area, increasingly recognized for its effectiveness across
diverse applications. At the heart of this field lies curvature, a powerful and
interpretable concept that captures intrinsic geometric structure and underpins
numerous tasks, from community detection to geometric deep learning. A wide
range of discrete curvature models have been proposed for various data
representations, including graphs, simplicial complexes, cubical complexes, and
point clouds sampled from manifolds. These models not only provide efficient
characterizations of data geometry but also constitute essential components in
geometric learning frameworks. In this paper, we present the first
comprehensive review of existing discrete curvature models, covering their
mathematical foundations, computational formulations, and practical
applications in data analysis and learning. In particular, we discuss discrete
curvature from both Riemannian and metric geometry perspectives and propose a
systematic pipeline for curvature-driven data analysis. We further examine the
corresponding computational algorithms across different data representations,
offering detailed comparisons and insights. Finally, we review state-of-the-art
applications of curvature in both supervised and unsupervised learning. This
survey provides a conceptual and practical roadmap for researchers to gain a
better understanding of discrete curvature as a fundamental tool for geometric
understanding and learning.

Motivation: 现实中的训练数据常被噪声和隐藏异常污染，影响现有无监督方法的准确性；复杂深度学习模型易过拟合且延迟高。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上，F1提高73.04%，运行时间降低81.28%；CRTF集成到其他模型平均提升5.35% F1。

Conclusion: CLEANet在污染数据和效率方面表现优异，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is essential for maintaining
the reliability of industrial systems, yet real-world deployment is hindered by
two critical challenges: training data contamination (noises and hidden
anomalies) and inefficient model inference. Existing unsupervised methods
assume clean training data, but contamination distorts learned patterns and
degrades detection accuracy. Meanwhile, complex deep models often overfit to
contamination and suffer from high latency, limiting practical use. To address
these challenges, we propose CLEANet, a robust and efficient anomaly detection
framework in contaminated multivariate time series. CLEANet introduces a
Contamination-Resilient Training Framework (CRTF) that mitigates the impact of
corrupted samples through an adaptive reconstruction weighting strategy
combined with clustering-guided contrastive learning, thereby enhancing
robustness. To further avoid overfitting on contaminated data and improve
computational efficiency, we design a lightweight conjugate MLP that
disentangles temporal and cross-feature dependencies. Across five public
datasets, CLEANet achieves up to 73.04% higher F1 and 81.28% lower runtime
compared with ten state-of-the-art baselines. Furthermore, integrating CRTF
into three advanced models yields an average 5.35% F1 gain, confirming its
strong generalizability.

Result: 推理速度提升1.55-1.85倍，性能损失极小。

Conclusion: FastVLM在保持性能的同时显著提升了推理效率。

Abstract: Vision-language Models (VLMs) have made significant strides in visual
understanding and query response generation, but often face challenges of high
computational cost and inference latency due to autoregressive decoding. In
this work, we introduce an imitation-learning-based Self-Speculative Decoding
(SSD) framework, named FastVLM, to address these limitations. Our approach
employs a lightweight draft model for token generation in an autoregressive
manner, while a full model verifies these tokens non-autoregressively. Accepted
tokens proceed seamlessly, while rejected tokens are corrected by the full
model and used to guide the draft model's refinement. Through an imitation
network, FastVLM enhances the draft model by integrating deeper level insights
from the full model's architecture. Also, it maintains the performance
integrity of the full model while training the draft model, achieving a balance
between efficiency and accuracy. Our method speeds up the inference process by
1.55-1.85x as compared to the final layer with minimal loss in performance.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved strong performance across a range
of graph representation learning tasks, yet their adversarial robustness in
graph classification remains underexplored compared to node classification.
While most existing defenses focus on the message-passing component, this work
investigates the overlooked role of pooling operations in shaping robustness.
We present a theoretical analysis of standard flat pooling methods (sum,
average and max), deriving upper bounds on their adversarial risk and
identifying their vulnerabilities under different attack scenarios and graph
structures. Motivated by these insights, we propose \textit{Robust Singular
Pooling (RS-Pool)}, a novel pooling strategy that leverages the dominant
singular vector of the node embedding matrix to construct a robust graph-level
representation. We theoretically investigate the robustness of RS-Pool and
interpret the resulting bound leading to improved understanding of our proposed
pooling operator. While our analysis centers on Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs), RS-Pool is model-agnostic and can be implemented efficiently via power
iteration. Empirical results on real-world benchmarks show that RS-Pool
provides better robustness than the considered pooling methods when subject to
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks while maintaining competitive clean
accuracy. Our code is publicly available

Conclusion: VPT模型为深度学习提供了一种灵活、非参数的贝叶斯先验，适用于随机梯度优化，并在性能和功能上具有竞争力。

Abstract: Density estimation is essential for generative modeling, particularly with
the rise of modern neural networks. While existing methods capture complex data
distributions, they often lack interpretability and uncertainty quantification.
Bayesian nonparametric methods, especially the \polya tree, offer a robust
framework that addresses these issues by accurately capturing function behavior
over small intervals. Traditional techniques like Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) face high computational complexity and scalability limitations,
hindering the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods in deep learning. To tackle
this, we introduce the variational \polya tree (VPT) model, which employs
stochastic variational inference to compute posterior distributions. This model
provides a flexible, nonparametric Bayesian prior that captures latent
densities and works well with stochastic gradient optimization. We also
leverage the joint distribution likelihood for a more precise variational
posterior approximation than traditional mean-field methods. We evaluate the
model performance on both real data and images, and demonstrate its
competitiveness with other state-of-the-art deep density estimation methods. We
also explore its ability in enhancing interpretability and uncertainty
quantification. Code is available at

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a spectrum of graph-related tasks, however concerns persist regarding their
vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. While prevailing defense strategies
focus primarily on pre-processing techniques and adaptive message-passing
schemes, this study delves into an under-explored dimension: the impact of
weight initialization and associated hyper-parameters, such as training epochs,
on a model's robustness. We introduce a theoretical framework bridging the
connection between initialization strategies and a network's resilience to
adversarial perturbations. Our analysis reveals a direct relationship between
initial weights, number of training epochs and the model's vulnerability,
offering new insights into adversarial robustness beyond conventional defense
mechanisms. While our primary focus is on GNNs, we extend our theoretical
framework, providing a general upper-bound applicable to Deep Neural Networks.
Extensive experiments, spanning diverse models and real-world datasets
subjected to various adversarial attacks, validate our findings. We illustrate
that selecting appropriate initialization not only ensures performance on clean
datasets but also enhances model robustness against adversarial perturbations,
with observed gaps of up to 50\% compared to alternative initialization
approaches.

Conclusion: M-LCB首次在预算约束下为多自适应专家训练提供遗憾保证，扩展了经典多臂老虎机范式。

Abstract: In many modern applications, a system must dynamically choose between several
adaptive learning algorithms that are trained online. Examples include model
selection in streaming environments, switching between trading strategies in
finance, and orchestrating multiple contextual bandit or reinforcement learning
agents. At each round, a learner must select one predictor among $K$ adaptive
experts to make a prediction, while being able to update at most $M \le K$ of
them under a fixed training budget.
  We address this problem in the \emph{stochastic setting} and introduce
\algname{M-LCB}, a computationally efficient UCB-style meta-algorithm that
provides \emph{anytime regret guarantees}. Its confidence intervals are built
directly from realized losses, require no additional optimization, and
seamlessly reflect the convergence properties of the underlying experts. If
each expert achieves internal regret $\tilde O(T^\alpha)$, then \algname{M-LCB}
ensures overall regret bounded by $\tilde O\!\Bigl(\sqrt{\tfrac{KT}{M}} \;+\;
(K/M)^{1-\alpha}\,T^\alpha\Bigr)$.
  To our knowledge, this is the first result establishing regret guarantees
when multiple adaptive experts are trained simultaneously under per-round
budget constraints. We illustrate the framework with two representative cases:
(i) parametric models trained online with stochastic losses, and (ii) experts
that are themselves multi-armed bandit algorithms. These examples highlight how
\algname{M-LCB} extends the classical bandit paradigm to the more realistic
scenario of coordinating stateful, self-learning experts under limited
resources.

learning representations without labeled data. Most SSL approaches rely on
strong, well-established, handcrafted data augmentations to generate diverse
views for representation learning. However, designing such augmentations
requires domain-specific knowledge and implicitly imposes representational
invariances on the model, which can limit generalization. In this work, we
propose an unsupervised representation learning method that replaces
augmentations by generating views using orthonormal bases and overcomplete
frames. We show that embeddings learned from orthonormal and overcomplete
spaces reside on distinct manifolds, shaped by the geometric biases introduced
by representing samples in different spaces. By jointly leveraging the
complementary geometry of these distinct manifolds, our approach achieves
superior performance without artificially increasing data diversity through
strong augmentations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on nine
datasets across five temporal sequence tasks, where signal-specific
characteristics make data augmentations particularly challenging. Without
relying on augmentation-induced diversity, our method achieves performance
gains of up to 15--20\% over existing self-supervised approaches. Source code:

*Shan Zhong,Shutong Ding,He Diao,Xiangyu Wang,Kah Chan Teh,Bei Peng*

TL;DR: FlowCritic提出了一种基于流匹配的生成范式，用于强化学习中的价值估计，解决了现有方法在捕捉复杂价值分布时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如多评论家集成和分布RL）在价值函数估计的可靠性上存在不足，前者缺乏分布信息，后者受限于离散化或分位数回归。

Method: FlowCritic利用流匹配建模价值分布并生成样本，取代传统的确定性价值预测回归方法。

Result: 该方法能够更灵活地表达复杂的价值分布。

Conclusion: FlowCritic为强化学习中的价值估计提供了一种新的生成范式，提升了估计的可靠性和表达能力。

Abstract: Reliable value estimation serves as the cornerstone of reinforcement learning
(RL) by evaluating long-term returns and guiding policy improvement,
significantly influencing the convergence speed and final performance. Existing
works improve the reliability of value function estimation via multi-critic
ensembles and distributional RL, yet the former merely combines multi point
estimation without capturing distributional information, whereas the latter
relies on discretization or quantile regression, limiting the expressiveness of
complex value distributions. Inspired by flow matching's success in generative
modeling, we propose a generative paradigm for value estimation, named
FlowCritic. Departing from conventional regression for deterministic value
prediction, FlowCritic leverages flow matching to model value distributions and
generate samples for value estimation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理多个潜在变量同时影响观测变量的场景时存在局限性，需要严格或不可验证的假设。

Method: 利用线性非高斯模型，通过构建特定高阶累积量矩阵，直接从矩阵的秩缺陷性质判断因果不对称性。

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性和渐近正确性。

Conclusion: 该方法无需迭代过程即可识别因果结构，适用于复杂潜在变量场景。

Abstract: Recovering causal structure in the presence of latent variables is an
important but challenging task. While many methods have been proposed to handle
it, most of them require strict and/or untestable assumptions on the causal
structure. In real-world scenarios, observed variables may be affected by
multiple latent variables simultaneously, which, generally speaking, cannot be
handled by these methods. In this paper, we consider the linear, non-Gaussian
case, and make use of the joint higher-order cumulant matrix of the observed
variables constructed in a specific way. We show that, surprisingly, causal
asymmetry between two observed variables can be directly seen from the rank
deficiency properties of such higher-order cumulant matrices, even in the
presence of an arbitrary number of latent confounders. Identifiability results
are established, and the corresponding identification methods do not even
involve iterative procedures. Experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and asymptotic correctness of our proposed method.

TL;DR: S-Chain是一个大规模医学视觉问答数据集，包含专家标注的视觉推理链，显著提升了医学视觉语言模型的可解释性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学视觉语言模型需要透明地对齐文本推理和视觉证据，但目前缺乏大规模专家级数据集支持逐步推理和视觉定位。

Method: 引入S-Chain数据集，包含12,000张医学图像和结构化视觉推理链（SV-CoT），并支持16种语言。通过该数据集对多种VLMs进行基准测试，并提出新机制加强视觉证据与推理的对齐。

Result: SV-CoT监督显著提升了模型的可解释性、定位准确性和鲁棒性，同时研究了其与检索增强生成的协同作用。

Conclusion: S-Chain为医学推理设立了新基准，推动了更可信和可解释的医学视觉语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Faithful reasoning in medical vision-language models (VLMs) requires not only
accurate predictions but also transparent alignment between textual rationales
and visual evidence. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise
in medical visual question answering (VQA), no large-scale expert-level dataset
has captured stepwise reasoning with precise visual grounding. We introduce
S-Chain, the first large-scale dataset of 12,000 expert-annotated medical
images with bounding boxes and structured visual CoT (SV-CoT), explicitly
linking visual regions to reasoning steps. The dataset further supports 16
languages, totaling over 700k VQA pairs for broad multilingual applicability.
Using S-Chain, we benchmark state-of-the-art medical VLMs (ExGra-Med,
LLaVA-Med) and general-purpose VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL2.5), showing that
SV-CoT supervision significantly improves interpretability, grounding fidelity,
and robustness. Beyond benchmarking, we study its synergy with
retrieval-augmented generation, revealing how domain knowledge and visual
grounding interact during autoregressive reasoning. Finally, we propose a new
mechanism that strengthens the alignment between visual evidence and reasoning,
improving both reliability and efficiency. S-Chain establishes a new benchmark
for grounded medical reasoning and paves the way toward more trustworthy and
explainable medical VLMs.

TL;DR: GP-BO在DBMS自动调优中存在局限性，Centrum通过两阶段学习过程和自适应预测改进调优效率和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GP-BO在DBMS性能建模和优化中的基本假设常被违反，而树集成方法（如SMAC）能避免这些问题，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出Centrum，采用两阶段随机梯度提升集成学习，结合自适应预测实现无分布不确定性估计。

Result: Centrum在两种DBMS和三种工作负载上优于21种现有方法。

Conclusion: Centrum首次实现无分布性，提升了BO在DBMS自动调优中的实用性，并融合了梯度提升集成和共形推断。

Abstract: Gaussian-Process-based Bayesian optimization (GP-BO), is a prevailing
model-based framework for DBMS auto-tuning. However, recent work shows
GP-BO-based DBMS auto-tuners significantly outperformed auto-tuners based on
SMAC, which features random forest surrogate models; such results motivate us
to rethink and investigate the limitations of GP-BO in auto-tuner design. We
find the fundamental assumptions of GP-BO are widely violated when modeling and
optimizing DBMS performance, while tree-ensemble-BOs (e.g., SMAC) can avoid the
assumption pitfalls and deliver improved tuning efficiency and effectiveness.
Moreover, we argue that existing tree-ensemble-BOs restrict further advancement
in DBMS auto-tuning. First, existing tree-ensemble-BOs can only achieve
distribution-free point estimates, but still impose unrealistic distributional
assumptions on uncertainty estimates, compromising surrogate modeling and
distort the acquisition function. Second, recent advances in gradient boosting,
which can further enhance surrogate modeling against vanilla GP and random
forest counterparts, have rarely been applied in optimizing DBMS auto-tuners.
To address these issues, we propose a novel model-based DBMS auto-tuner,
Centrum. Centrum improves distribution-free point and interval estimation in
surrogate modeling with a two-phase learning procedure of stochastic gradient
boosting ensembles. Moreover, Centrum adopts a generalized SGBE-estimated
locally-adaptive conformal prediction to facilitate a distribution-free
uncertainty estimation and acquisition function. To our knowledge, Centrum is
the first auto-tuner to realize distribution-freeness, enhancing BO's
practicality in DBMS auto-tuning, and the first to seamlessly fuse gradient
boosting ensembles and conformal inference in BO. Extensive physical and
simulation experiments on two DBMSs and three workloads show Centrum
outperforms 21 SOTA methods.

Method: 提出扩散模型参数化的模糊集设计，并基于此开发D-DRO算法，解决内层最大化问题。

Result: 理论证明了D-DRO的收敛性，实验显示其在OOD泛化任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: D-DRO通过扩散模型有效扩展了模糊集的多样性，提升了鲁棒性和泛化性能。

Abstract: This paper studies Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), a fundamental
framework for enhancing the robustness and generalization of statistical
learning and optimization. An effective ambiguity set for DRO must involve
distributions that remain consistent with the nominal distribution while being
diverse enough to account for a variety of potential scenarios. Moreover, it
should lead to tractable DRO solutions. To this end, we propose a
diffusion-based ambiguity set design that captures various adversarial
distributions beyond the nominal support space while maintaining consistency
with the nominal distribution. Building on this ambiguity modeling, we propose
Diffusion-based DRO (D-DRO), a tractable DRO algorithm that solves the inner
maximization over the parameterized diffusion model space. We formally
establish the stationary convergence performance of D-DRO and empirically
demonstrate its superior Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization performance
in a ML prediction task.

TL;DR: TALE是一种推理时算法，通过优化任务特定验证性能来剪枝Transformer层，无需重新训练即可提升准确率并降低计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常需要重新训练，而TALE旨在通过直接优化任务性能来剪枝层，同时提高效率和准确性。

Method: TALE在推理时剪枝Transformer层，通过任务特定验证性能优化选择剪枝层，支持零样本和少样本设置。

Result: 在9个任务和5个模型上验证，TALE显著提升准确率并减少计算成本，且在微调中进一步改善性能。

Conclusion: TALE通过选择性剪枝解决瓶颈层问题，生成更小、更快、更准确的模型，同时增强Transformer的可解释性。

Abstract: In this paper we introduce Tale, Task-Aware Layer Elimination, an
inference-time algorithm that prunes entire transformer layers in an LLM by
directly optimizing task-specific validation performance. We evaluate TALE on 9
tasks and 5 models, including LLaMA 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B, Qwen 2.5 0.5B, Mistral
7B, and Lucie 7B, under both zero-shot and few-shot settings. Unlike prior
approaches, TALE requires no retraining and consistently improves accuracy
while reducing computational cost across all benchmarks. Furthermore, applying
TALE during finetuning leads to additional performance gains. Finally, TALE
provides flexible user control over trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency.
Mutual information analysis shows that certain layers act as bottlenecks,
degrading task-relevant representations. Tale's selective layer removal
remedies this problem, producing smaller, faster, and more accurate models that
are also faster to fine-tune while offering new insights into transformer
interpretability.

TL;DR: SeeDNorm是一种动态调整缩放系数的归一化层，通过保留输入范数信息并实现数据依赖的动态归一化，提升了模型的表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RMSNorm丢弃了输入范数信息，且静态缩放系数可能无法适应输入数据的广泛变化和分布偏移，限制了性能提升。

Method: 提出SeeDNorm，动态调整缩放系数，保留输入范数信息，并在反向传播中保持RMSNorm的动态梯度调整能力。

Result: 在大型语言模型预训练及计算机视觉任务中，SeeDNorm性能优于RMSNorm、LayerNorm和DyT。

Conclusion: SeeDNorm通过引入少量参数，显著提升了模型性能，且不影响效率。

Abstract: Normalization layer constitutes an essential component in neural networks. In
transformers, the predominantly used RMSNorm constrains vectors to a unit
hypersphere, followed by dimension-wise rescaling through a learnable scaling
coefficient $\gamma$ to maintain the representational capacity of the model.
However, RMSNorm discards the input norm information in forward pass and a
static scaling factor $\gamma$ may be insufficient to accommodate the wide
variability of input data and distributional shifts, thereby limiting further
performance improvements, particularly in zero-shot scenarios that large
language models routinely encounter. To address this limitation, we propose
SeeDNorm, which enhances the representational capability of the model by
dynamically adjusting the scaling coefficient based on the current input,
thereby preserving the input norm information and enabling data-dependent,
self-rescaled dynamic normalization. During backpropagation, SeeDNorm retains
the ability of RMSNorm to dynamically adjust gradient according to the input
norm. We provide a detailed analysis of the training optimization for SeedNorm
and proposed corresponding solutions to address potential instability issues
that may arise when applying SeeDNorm. We validate the effectiveness of
SeeDNorm across models of varying sizes in large language model pre-training as
well as supervised and unsupervised computer vision tasks. By introducing a
minimal number of parameters and with neglligible impact on model efficiency,
SeeDNorm achieves consistently superior performance compared to previously
commonly used normalization layers such as RMSNorm and LayerNorm, as well as
element-wise activation alternatives to normalization layers like DyT.

Method: 动态计算节点嵌入，支持跨数据集归纳迁移学习。

Result: 在零样本设置下表现优异，轻量微调后性能进一步提升。

Conclusion: 图推荐中的归纳迁移学习可行，交互级消息传递支持跨数据集泛化。

Abstract: Graph-based recommender systems are commonly trained in transductive
settings, which limits their applicability to new users, items, or datasets. We
propose NBF-Rec, a graph-based recommendation model that supports inductive
transfer learning across datasets with disjoint user and item sets. Unlike
conventional embedding-based methods that require retraining for each domain,
NBF-Rec computes node embeddings dynamically at inference time. We evaluate the
method on seven real-world datasets spanning movies, music, e-commerce, and
location check-ins. NBF-Rec achieves competitive performance in zero-shot
settings, where no target domain data is used for training, and demonstrates
further improvements through lightweight fine-tuning. These results show that
inductive transfer is feasible in graph-based recommendation and that
interaction-level message passing supports generalization across datasets
without requiring aligned users or items.

Conclusion: 该方法可能是神经网络之外的可扩展机器学习与人工智能的可行替代方案，同时保持底层机制的人类可理解性。

Abstract: Traditional machine learning relies on explicit models and domain
assumptions, limiting flexibility and interpretability. We introduce a
model-free framework using surprisal (information theoretic uncertainty) to
directly analyze and perform inferences from raw data, eliminating distribution
modeling, reducing bias, and enabling efficient updates including direct edits
and deletion of training data. By quantifying relevance through uncertainty,
the approach enables generalizable inference across tasks including generative
inference, causal discovery, anomaly detection, and time series forecasting. It
emphasizes traceability, interpretability, and data-driven decision making,
offering a unified, human-understandable framework for machine learning, and
achieves at or near state-of-the-art performance across most common machine
learning tasks. The mathematical foundations create a ``physics'' of
information, which enable these techniques to apply effectively to a wide
variety of complex data types, including missing data. Empirical results
indicate that this may be a viable alternative path to neural networks with
regard to scalable machine learning and artificial intelligence that can
maintain human understandability of the underlying mechanics.

Result: 理论证明后悔上界为O(log T)，包含集中式最优后悔和通信效率影响的附加项。

Conclusion: 算法优于现有基准，验证了理论后悔与问题复杂度的关系。

Abstract: We study the distributed multi-agent multi-armed bandit problem with
heterogeneous rewards over random communication graphs. Uniquely, at each time
step $t$ agents communicate over a time-varying random graph $G_t$ generated by
applying the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model to a fixed connected base graph $G$ (for
classical Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs, $G$ is a complete graph), where each
potential edge in $G$ is randomly and independently present with the link
probability $p$. Notably, the resulting random graph is not necessarily
connected at each time step. Each agent's arm rewards follow time-invariant
distributions, and the reward distribution for the same arm may differ across
agents. The goal is to minimize the cumulative expected regret relative to the
global mean reward of each arm, defined as the average of that arm's mean
rewards across all agents. To this end, we propose a fully distributed
algorithm that integrates the arm elimination strategy with the random gossip
algorithm. We theoretically show that the regret upper bound is of order $\log
T$ and is highly interpretable, where $T$ is the time horizon. It includes the
optimal centralized regret $O\left(\sum_{k: \Delta_k>0} \frac{\log
T}{\Delta_k}\right)$ and an additional term $O\left(\frac{N^2 \log T}{p
\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))} + \frac{KN^2 \log T}{p}\right)$ where $N$ and $K$ denote
the total number of agents and arms, respectively. This term reflects the
impact of $G$'s algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{N-1}(Lap(G))$ and the link
probability $p$, and thus highlights a fundamental trade-off between
communication efficiency and regret. As a by-product, we show a nearly optimal
regret lower bound. Finally, our numerical experiments not only show the
superiority of our algorithm over existing benchmarks, but also validate the
theoretical regret scaling with problem complexity.

Method: 通过LOESS分解AQI序列为趋势、季节和残差部分，ARIMA建模平滑部分，深度学习模块捕捉残差中的多尺度波动，并使用UAMMO优化超参数。

Result: 在2021-2023年数据上，该方法在PM2.5、O3、CO和NOx上均优于基线，MSE降低5-8%，R^2得分>0.94。

Conclusion: 该框架对突发污染事件敏感，适用于城市空气质量管理，表现出鲁棒性和高准确性。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a critical environmental and public health concern in
Indian megacities such as Delhi, Kolkata, and Mumbai, where sudden spikes in
pollutant levels challenge timely intervention. Accurate Air Quality Index
(AQI) forecasting is difficult due to the coexistence of linear trends,
seasonal variations, and volatile nonlinear patterns. This paper proposes a
hybrid forecasting framework that integrates LOESS decomposition, ARIMA
modeling, and a multi-scale CNN-BiLSTM network with a residual-gated attention
mechanism. The LOESS step separates the AQI series into trend, seasonal, and
residual components, with ARIMA modeling the smooth components and the proposed
deep learning module capturing multi-scale volatility in the residuals. Model
hyperparameters are tuned via the Unified Adaptive Multi-Stage Metaheuristic
Optimizer (UAMMO), combining multiple optimization strategies for efficient
convergence. Experiments on 2021-2023 AQI datasets from the Central Pollution
Control Board show that the proposed method consistently outperforms
statistical, deep learning, and hybrid baselines across PM2.5, O3, CO, and NOx
in three major cities, achieving up to 5-8% lower MSE and higher R^2 scores
(>0.94) for all pollutants. These results demonstrate the framework's
robustness, sensitivity to sudden pollution events, and applicability to urban
air quality management.

Method: 通过理论分析，研究了BOBW FTRL算法（1/2-Tsallis-INF）的Bregman散度衰减速率。

Result: 研究发现，Bregman散度以$t^{-1/2}$的速率衰减，部分验证了对数遗憾与$t^{-1}$收敛速率相关的直觉。

Conclusion: 本文部分证实了对数遗憾与$t^{-1}$收敛速率相关的直觉，为FTRL算法的最后迭代收敛提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The convergence analysis of online learning algorithms is central to machine
learning theory, where last-iterate convergence is particularly important, as
it captures the learner's actual decisions and describes the evolution of the
learning process over time. However, in multi-armed bandits, most existing
algorithmic analyses mainly focus on the order of regret, while the
last-iterate (simple regret) convergence rate remains less explored --
especially for the widely studied Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL)
algorithms. Recently, a growing line of work has established the
Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) property of FTRL algorithms in bandit problems,
showing in particular that they achieve logarithmic regret in stochastic
bandits. Nevertheless, their last-iterate convergence rate has not yet been
studied. Intuitively, logarithmic regret should correspond to a $t^{-1}$
last-iterate convergence rate. This paper partially confirms this intuition
through theoretical analysis, showing that the Bregman divergence, defined by
the regular function $\Psi(p)=-4\sum_{i=1}^{d}\sqrt{p_i}$ associated with the
BOBW FTRL algorithm $1/2$-Tsallis-INF (arXiv:1807.07623), between the point
mass on the optimal arm and the probability distribution over the arm set
obtained at iteration $t$, decays at a rate of $t^{-1/2}$.

Result: 实验显示92%-98%属性满足率，神经GAN训练提升5%-14%挑战性属性表现。

Conclusion: LOGAN提供了一种逻辑约束生成的有效方法，兼具可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: GANs promise indistinguishability, logic explains it. We put the two on a
budget: a discriminator that can only ``see'' up to a logical depth $k$, and a
generator that must look correct to that bounded observer. \textbf{LOGAN}
(LOGical GANs) casts the discriminator as a depth-$k$ Ehrenfeucht--Fra\"iss\'e
(EF) \emph{Opponent} that searches for small, legible faults (odd cycles,
nonplanar crossings, directed bridges), while the generator plays
\emph{Builder}, producing samples that admit a $k$-round matching to a target
theory $T$. We ship a minimal toolkit -- an EF-probe simulator and MSO-style
graph checkers -- and four experiments including real neural GAN training with
PyTorch. Beyond verification, we score samples with a \emph{logical loss} that
mixes budgeted EF round-resilience with cheap certificate terms, enabling a
practical curriculum on depth. Framework validation demonstrates $92\%$--$98\%$
property satisfaction via simulation (Exp.~3), while real neural GAN training
achieves $5\%$--$14\%$ improvements on challenging properties and $98\%$
satisfaction on connectivity (matching simulation) through adversarial learning
(Exp.~4). LOGAN is a compact, reproducible path toward logic-bounded generation
with interpretable failures, proven effectiveness (both simulated and real
training), and dials for control.

Conclusion: 该方法通过自适应噪声处理、不确定性量化和通用去噪能力，显著提升了单细胞数据的分析质量。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables the study of cellular
heterogeneity. Yet, clustering accuracy, and with it downstream analyses based
on cell labels, remain challenging due to measurement noise and biological
variability. In standard latent spaces (e.g., obtained through PCA), data from
different cell types can be projected close together, making accurate
clustering difficult. We introduce a latent plug-and-play diffusion framework
that separates the observation and denoising space. This separation is
operationalized through a novel Gibbs sampling procedure: the learned diffusion
prior is applied in a low-dimensional latent space to perform denoising, while
to steer this process, noise is reintroduced into the original high-dimensional
observation space. This unique "input-space steering" ensures the denoising
trajectory remains faithful to the original data structure. Our approach offers
three key advantages: (1) adaptive noise handling via a tunable balance between
prior and observed data; (2) uncertainty quantification through principled
uncertainty estimates for downstream analysis; and (3) generalizable denoising
by leveraging clean reference data to denoise noisier datasets, and via
averaging, improve quality beyond the training set. We evaluate robustness on
both synthetic and real single-cell genomics data. Our method improves
clustering accuracy on synthetic data across varied noise levels and dataset
shifts. On real-world single-cell data, our method demonstrates improved
biological coherence in the resulting cell clusters, with cluster boundaries
that better align with known cell type markers and developmental trajectories.

Result: 训练后的PINN能准确预测噪声强度、兴奋性和时间尺度分离对尖峰序列相干性的影响，计算效率显著优于纯数据驱动方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为模拟和分析多尺度随机系统中的噪声诱导相干性提供了一种数据高效且可解释的替代模型。

Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent
oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without
external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a
physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in
the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic
differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints
directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a
Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates
data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints
derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the
dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and
timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with
substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely
data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The
framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for
simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic
systems.

Conclusion: E2D2通过架构创新和算法优化，显著提升了离散扩散模型的效率和性能。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models enable parallel token sampling for faster inference
than autoregressive approaches. However, prior diffusion models use a
decoder-only architecture, which requires sampling algorithms that invoke the
full network at every denoising step and incur high computational cost. Our key
insight is that discrete diffusion models perform two types of computation: 1)
representing clean tokens and 2) denoising corrupted tokens, which enables us
to use separate modules for each task. We propose an encoder-decoder
architecture to accelerate discrete diffusion inference, which relies on an
encoder to represent clean tokens and a lightweight decoder to iteratively
refine a noised sequence. We also show that this architecture enables faster
training of block diffusion models, which partition sequences into blocks for
better quality and are commonly used in diffusion language model inference. We
introduce a framework for Efficient Encoder-Decoder Diffusion (E2D2),
consisting of an architecture with specialized training and sampling
algorithms, and we show that E2D2 achieves superior trade-offs between
generation quality and inference throughput on summarization, translation, and
mathematical reasoning tasks. We provide the code, model weights, and blog post

Abstract: Precipitation prediction has undergone a profound transformation -- from
early symbolic and empirical methods rooted in divination and observation, to
modern technologies based on atmospheric physics and artificial intelligence.
This review traces the historical and technological evolution of precipitation
forecasting, presenting a survey about end-to-end precipitation prediction
technologies that spans ancient practices, the foundations of meteorological
science, the rise of numerical weather prediction (NWP), and the emergence of
machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. We first explore
traditional and indigenous forecasting methods, then describe the development
of physical modeling and statistical frameworks that underpin contemporary
operational forecasting. Particular emphasis is placed on recent advances in
neural network-based approaches, including automated deep learning,
interpretability-driven design, and hybrid physical-data models. By compositing
research across multiple eras and paradigms, this review not only depicts the
history of end-to-end precipitation prediction but also outlines future
directions in next generation forecasting systems.

TL;DR: RLPD-GX框架通过分离策略优化与安全执行，结合动态课程学习，实现了高效且稳定的混合离线-在线强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决混合离线-在线强化学习中因数据分布偏移导致的不稳定性问题。

Method: 采用奖励驱动的学习器自由探索，基于投影的守护者确保安全执行，并引入动态课程学习。

Result: 在Atari-100k上取得3.02的标准化平均分（比现有方法提升45%），并在安全性和稳定性上表现优异。

Conclusion: 分离安全执行是一种简单而有效的设计，为强化学习中探索与安全的平衡提供了新思路。

Abstract: Hybrid offline--online reinforcement learning (O2O RL) promises both sample
efficiency and robust exploration, but suffers from instability due to
distribution shift between offline and online data. We introduce RLPD-GX, a
framework that decouples policy optimization from safety enforcement: a
reward-seeking learner explores freely, while a projection-based guardian
guarantees rule-consistent execution and safe value backups. This design
preserves the exploratory value of online interactions without collapsing to
conservative policies. To further stabilize training, we propose dynamic
curricula that gradually extend temporal horizons and anneal offline--online
data mixing. We prove convergence via a contraction property of the guarded
Bellman operator, and empirically show state-of-the-art performance on
Atari-100k, achieving a normalized mean score of 3.02 (+45\% over prior hybrid
methods) with stronger safety and stability. Beyond Atari, ablations
demonstrate consistent gains across safety-critical and long-horizon tasks,
underscoring the generality of our design. Extensive and comprehensive results
highlight decoupled safety enforcement as a simple yet principled route to
robust O2O RL, suggesting a broader paradigm for reconciling exploration and
safety in reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在48小时后的PM2.5预测稳定性不足，尤其在监测网络稀疏的城市。

Method: 结合DTW选择相似站点、轻量级CNN-GRU架构和气象特征，优化稀疏网络设计。

Result: 在伊朗伊斯法罕的实验中，24小时预测R2=0.91，首次实现稳定的10天预测（R2=0.73）。

Conclusion: 该框架计算高效，适用于资源受限的城市环境，满足早期预警需求。

Abstract: Reliable long-term forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations is critical for public
health early-warning systems, yet existing deep learning approaches struggle to
maintain prediction stability beyond 48 hours, especially in cities with sparse
monitoring networks. This paper presents a deep learning framework that
combines Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for intelligent station similarity
selection with a CNN-GRU architecture to enable extended-horizon PM2.5
forecasting in Isfahan, Iran, a city characterized by complex pollution
dynamics and limited monitoring coverage. Unlike existing approaches that rely
on computationally intensive transformer models or external simulation tools,
our method integrates three key innovations: (i) DTW-based historical sampling
to identify similar pollution patterns across peer stations, (ii) a lightweight
CNN-GRU architecture augmented with meteorological features, and (iii) a
scalable design optimized for sparse networks. Experimental validation using
multi-year hourly data from eight monitoring stations demonstrates superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning methods, achieving R2 =
0.91 for 24-hour forecasts. Notably, this is the first study to demonstrate
stable 10-day PM2.5 forecasting (R2 = 0.73 at 240 hours) without performance
degradation, addressing critical early-warning system requirements. The
framework's computational efficiency and independence from external tools make
it particularly suitable for deployment in resource-constrained urban
environments.

Motivation: 研究基础模型在临床表型发现中的有效性，尤其是其生成的嵌入是否具有临床意义。

Method: 使用LSTM和简化Transformer模型在HIV和急性低血压数据集上进行训练，并添加随机间隔以模拟不规则性。

Result: 模型能复现特征分布，但无法保持跨特征结构，表明生成预训练仅具备局部真实性。

Conclusion: 需进行领域特异性评估，轨迹合成可作为微调或部署前的实用测试。

Abstract: Foundation models refer to architectures trained on vast datasets using
autoregressive pre-training from natural language processing to capture
intricate patterns and motifs. They were originally developed to transfer such
learned knowledge to downstream predictive tasks. Recently, however, some
studies repurpose these learned representations for phenotype discovery without
rigorous validation, risking superficially realistic but clinically incoherent
embeddings. To test this mismatch, we trained two autoregressive models -- a
sequence-to-sequence LSTM and a reduced Transformer -- on longitudinal ART for
HIV and Acute Hypotension datasets. Controlled irregularity was added during
training via random inter-visit gaps, while test sequences stayed complete.
Patient-trajectory synthesis evaluated distributional and correlational
fidelity. Both reproduced feature distributions but failed to preserve
cross-feature structure -- showing that generative pre-training yields local
realism but limited clinical coherence. These results highlight the need for
domain-specific evaluation and support trajectory synthesis as a practical
probe before fine-tuning or deployment.

Result: 在多个联邦多模态基准测试中，性能提升高达36.45%，理论分析支持实证结果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了数据不完整和异构问题，提升了联邦学习的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal federated learning in real-world settings often encounters
incomplete and heterogeneous data across clients. This results in misaligned
local feature representations that limit the effectiveness of model
aggregation. Unlike prior work that assumes either differing modality sets
without missing input features or a shared modality set with missing features
across clients, we consider a more general and realistic setting where each
client observes a different subset of modalities and might also have missing
input features within each modality. To address the resulting misalignment in
learned representations, we propose a new federated learning framework
featuring locally adaptive representations based on learnable client-side
embedding controls that encode each client's data-missing patterns.
  These embeddings serve as reconfiguration signals that align the globally
aggregated representation with each client's local context, enabling more
effective use of shared information. Furthermore, the embedding controls can be
algorithmically aggregated across clients with similar data-missing patterns to
enhance the robustness of reconfiguration signals in adapting the global
representation. Empirical results on multiple federated multimodal benchmarks
with diverse data-missing patterns across clients demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed method, achieving up to 36.45\% performance improvement under
severe data incompleteness. The method is also supported by a theoretical
analysis with an explicit performance bound that matches our empirical
observations. Our source codes are provided at

Motivation: 传统方法如RLHF复杂且不稳定，需要更简单有效的对齐方法。

Method: 通过MML估计重新定义对齐问题，最大化偏好文本输出的边际对数似然，无需显式奖励模型和熵最大化。

Result: MMPO在135M到8B参数的模型中表现稳定，对齐效果优于基线，同时保留基础模型的语言能力。

Conclusion: MMPO通过梯度更新中的隐式偏好优化，实现了高效且稳定的对齐。

Abstract: Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human preferences is crucial, but
standard methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) are
often complex and unstable. In this work, we propose a new, simpler approach
that recasts alignment through the lens of Maximum Marginal Likelihood (MML)
estimation. Our new MML based Preference Optimization (MMPO) maximizes the
marginal log-likelihood of a preferred text output, using the preference pair
as samples for approximation, and forgoes the need for both an explicit reward
model and entropy maximization. We theoretically demonstrate that MMPO
implicitly performs preference optimization, producing a weighted gradient that
naturally up-weights chosen responses over rejected ones. Across models ranging
from 135M to 8B parameters, we empirically show that MMPO: 1) is more stable
with respect to the hyperparameter $\beta$ compared to alternative baselines,
and 2) achieves competitive or superior preference alignment while better
preserving the base model's general language capabilities. Through a series of
ablation experiments, we show that this improved performance is indeed
attributable to MMPO's implicit preference optimization within the gradient
updates.

Abstract: Linguistic Landscape (LL) research traditionally relies on manual photography
and annotation of public signages to examine distribution of languages in urban
space. While such methods yield valuable findings, the process is
time-consuming and difficult for large study areas. This study explores the use
of AI powered language detection method to automate LL analysis. Using Honolulu
Chinatown as a case study, we constructed a georeferenced photo dataset of
1,449 images collected by researchers and applied AI for optical character
recognition (OCR) and language classification. We also conducted manual
validations for accuracy checking. This model achieved an overall accuracy of
79%. Five recurring types of mislabeling were identified, including distortion,
reflection, degraded surface, graffiti, and hallucination. The analysis also
reveals that the AI model treats all regions of an image equally, detecting
peripheral or background texts that human interpreters typically ignore.
Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the potential of integrating
AI-assisted workflows into LL research to reduce such time-consuming processes.
However, due to all the limitations and mis-labels, we recognize that AI cannot
be fully trusted during this process. This paper encourages a hybrid approach
combining AI automation with human validation for a more reliable and efficient
workflow.

Abstract: Natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions, pose significant challenges to
daily life and incur considerable global economic losses. The emergence of
next-generation small-satellites, capable of constellation-based operations,
offers unparalleled opportunities for near-real-time monitoring and onboard
processing of such events. However, a major bottleneck remains the lack of
extensive annotated datasets capturing volcanic activity, which hinders the
development of robust detection systems. This paper introduces a novel dataset
explicitly designed for volcanic activity and eruption detection, encompassing
diverse volcanoes worldwide. The dataset provides binary annotations to
identify volcanic anomalies or non-anomalies, covering phenomena such as
temperature anomalies, eruptions, and volcanic ash emissions. These annotations
offer a foundational resource for developing and evaluating detection models,
addressing a critical gap in volcanic monitoring research. Additionally, we
present comprehensive benchmarks using state-of-the-art models to establish
baselines for future studies. Furthermore, we explore the potential for
deploying these models onboard next-generation satellites. Using the Intel
Movidius Myriad X VPU as a testbed, we demonstrate the feasibility of volcanic
activity detection directly onboard. This capability significantly reduces
latency and enhances response times, paving the way for advanced early warning
systems. This paves the way for innovative solutions in volcanic disaster
management, encouraging further exploration and refinement of onboard
monitoring technologies.

Abstract: Subgraph matching is vital in knowledge graph (KG) question answering,
molecule design, scene graph, code and circuit search, etc. Neural methods have
shown promising results for subgraph matching. Our study of recent systems
suggests refactoring them into a unified design space for graph matching
networks. Existing methods occupy only a few isolated patches in this space,
which remains largely uncharted. We undertake the first comprehensive
exploration of this space, featuring such axes as attention-based vs. soft
permutation-based interaction between query and corpus graphs, aligning nodes
vs. edges, and the form of the final scoring network that integrates neural
representations of the graphs. Our extensive experiments reveal that judicious
and hitherto-unexplored combinations of choices in this space lead to large
performance benefits. Beyond better performance, our study uncovers valuable
insights and establishes general design principles for neural graph
representation and interaction, which may be of wider interest.

Abstract: We investigate the role of network architecture in shaping the inductive
biases of modern score-based generative models. To this end, we introduce the
Score Anisotropy Directions (SADs), architecture-dependent directions that
reveal how different networks preferentially capture data structure. Our
analysis shows that SADs form adaptive bases aligned with the architecture's
output geometry, providing a principled way to predict generalization ability
in score models prior to training. Through both synthetic data and standard
image benchmarks, we demonstrate that SADs reliably capture fine-grained model
behavior and correlate with downstream performance, as measured by Wasserstein
metrics. Our work offers a new lens for explaining and predicting directional
biases of generative models.

Conclusion: SSBA是一种简单有效的模型无关方法，能够生成最近且可行的反事实解释，适用于高维和约束场景。

Abstract: In our article, we describe a method for generating counterfactual
explanations in high-dimensional spaces using four steps that involve fitting
our dataset to a model, finding the decision boundary, determining constraints
on the problem, and computing the closest point (counterfactual explanation)
from that boundary. We propose a discretized approach where we find many
discrete points on the boundary and then identify the closest feasible
counterfactual explanation. This method, which we later call $\textit{Segmented
Sampling for Boundary Approximation}$ (SSBA), applies binary search to find
decision boundary points and then searches for the closest boundary point.
Across four datasets of varying dimensionality, we show that our method can
outperform current methods for counterfactual generation with reductions in
distance between $5\%$ to $50\%$ in terms of the $L_2$ norm. Our method can
also handle real-world constraints by restricting changes to immutable and
categorical features, such as age, gender, sex, height, and other related
characteristics such as the case for a health-based dataset. In terms of
runtime, the SSBA algorithm generates decision boundary points on multiple
orders of magnitude in the same given time when we compare to a grid-based
approach. In general, our method provides a simple and effective model-agnostic
method that can compute nearest feasible (i.e. realistic with constraints)
counterfactual explanations. All of our results and our code can be found here

Conclusion: 简化损失函数和对比学习思想的结合有效提升了USDMs的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been extended to language generation through
Masked Diffusion Language Models (MDLMs), which achieve performance competitive
with strong autoregressive models. However, MDLMs tend to degrade in the
few-step regime and cannot directly adopt existing few-step distillation
methods designed for continuous diffusion models, as they lack the intrinsic
property of mapping from noise to data. Recent Uniform-state Diffusion Models
(USDMs), initialized from a uniform prior, alleviate some limitations but still
suffer from complex loss formulations that hinder scalability. In this work, we
propose a simplified denoising-based loss for USDMs that optimizes only
noise-replaced tokens, stabilizing training and matching ELBO-level
performance. Furthermore, by framing denoising as self-supervised learning, we
introduce a simple modification to our denoising loss with contrastive-inspired
negative gradients, which is practical and yield additional improvements in
generation quality.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in complex, high-dimensional data, such as UAV sensor
readings, is essential for operational safety but challenging for existing
methods due to their limited sensitivity, scalability, and inability to capture
intricate dependencies. We propose the Diffuse to Detect (DTD) framework, a
novel approach that innovatively adapts diffusion models for anomaly detection,
diverging from their conventional use in generative tasks with high inference
time. By comparison, DTD employs a single-step diffusion process to predict
noise patterns, enabling rapid and precise identification of anomalies without
reconstruction errors. This approach is grounded in robust theoretical
foundations that link noise prediction to the data distribution's score
function, ensuring reliable deviation detection. By integrating Graph Neural
Networks to model sensor relationships as dynamic graphs, DTD effectively
captures spatial (inter-sensor) and temporal anomalies. Its two-branch
architecture, with parametric neural network-based energy scoring for
scalability and nonparametric statistical methods for interpretability,
provides flexible trade-offs between computational efficiency and transparency.
Extensive evaluations on UAV sensor data, multivariate time series, and images
demonstrate DTD's superior performance over existing methods, underscoring its
generality across diverse data modalities. This versatility, combined with its
adaptability, positions DTD as a transformative solution for safety-critical
applications, including industrial monitoring and beyond.

establishing statistical reliability guarantees for LLMs under CL, particularly
in the setting of continual domain pretraining (CDP). Conformal Prediction (CP)
has shown promise in offering correctness guarantees for LLMs, but it faces
major challenges in CDP: testing data often stems from unknown or shifting
domain distributions, under which CP may no longer provide valid guarantees.
Moreover, when high coverage is required, CP can yield excessively large
prediction sets for unanswerable queries, reducing informativeness. To address
these challenges, we introduce an adaptive rejection and non-exchangeable CP
framework. Our method first estimates the distribution of questions across
domains in the test set using transformer-based clustering, then reweights or
resamples the calibration data accordingly. Building on this, adaptive
rejection CP allows the LLM to selectively abstain from answering when its
confidence or competence shifts significantly. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework enhances both the effectiveness and reliability
of CP under CDP scenarios. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的动态生成辅助任务的方法，避免了双层优化的计算成本，并在CIFAR100上表现优于人工标注的辅助任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辅助学习需要标注的辅助任务，这需要人力和领域知识。现有方法依赖双层优化，计算成本高且复杂。

Method: 使用强化学习代理动态选择辅助标签，并通过奖励机制优化主任务性能。还探索了辅助损失权重的学习策略。

Result: 在CIFAR100上，RL方法优于人工标注任务，与双层优化技术相当。权重学习方法显著优于所有基准。

Conclusion: 强化学习是动态生成辅助任务的可行方法，且可以学习样本级辅助任务权重，取得优异结果。

Abstract: Auxiliary Learning (AL) is a special case of Multi-task Learning (MTL) in
which a network trains on auxiliary tasks to improve performance on its main
task. This technique is used to improve generalization and, ultimately,
performance on the network's main task. AL has been demonstrated to improve
performance across multiple domains, including navigation, image
classification, and natural language processing. One weakness of AL is the need
for labeled auxiliary tasks, which can require human effort and domain
expertise to generate. Meta Learning techniques have been used to solve this
issue by learning an additional auxiliary task generation network that can
create helpful tasks for the primary network. The most prominent techniques
rely on Bi-Level Optimization, which incurs computational cost and increased
code complexity. To avoid the need for Bi-Level Optimization, we present an
RL-based approach to dynamically create auxiliary tasks. In this framework, an
RL agent is tasked with selecting auxiliary labels for every data point in a
training set. The agent is rewarded when their selection improves the
performance on the primary task. We also experiment with learning optimal
strategies for weighing the auxiliary loss per data point. On the 20-Superclass
CIFAR100 problem, our RL approach outperforms human-labeled auxiliary tasks and
performs as well as a prominent Bi-Level Optimization technique. Our weight
learning approaches significantly outperform all of these benchmarks. For
example, a Weight-Aware RL-based approach helps the VGG16 architecture achieve
80.9% test accuracy while the human-labeled auxiliary task setup achieved
75.53%. The goal of this work is to (1) prove that RL is a viable approach to
dynamically generate auxiliary tasks and (2) demonstrate that per-sample
auxiliary task weights can be learned alongside the auxiliary task labels and
can achieve strong results.

*Zhenglai Shen,Hongyu Zhou*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT)框架，结合物理信息神经网络、多模态数据融合和公平风险分析，用于城市级灾害响应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复合气候灾害（如野火引发的停电和城市热浪）威胁城市稳定性和公平性，需要一种智能决策支持系统。

Method: H-RDT结合物理信息神经网络建模、多模态数据融合和公平风险分析，通过强化学习模块动态调整输入权重。

Result: 在模拟灾害场景中，H-RDT保持稳定的室内温度预测，减少热风险11-13%，尾部风险7-17%，过热时间减少9%。

Conclusion: H-RDT为城市灾害响应提供了可扩展的框架，将物理灾害建模与社会公平和决策智能结合，推动数字城市韧性发展。

Abstract: Compounding climate hazards, such as wildfire-induced outages and urban
heatwaves, challenge the stability and equity of cities. We present a
Hazard-Responsive Digital Twin (H-RDT) that combines physics-informed neural
network modeling, multimodal data fusion, and equity-aware risk analytics for
urban-scale response. In a synthetic district with diverse building archetypes
and populations, a simulated wildfire-outage-heatwave cascade shows that H-RDT
maintains stable indoor temperature predictions (approximately 31 to 33 C)
under partial sensor loss, reproducing outage-driven surges and recovery. The
reinforcement learning based fusion module adaptively reweights IoT, UAV, and
satellite inputs to sustain spatiotemporal coverage, while the equity-adjusted
mapping isolates high-vulnerability clusters (schools, clinics, low-income
housing). Prospective interventions, such as preemptive cooling-center
activation and microgrid sharing, reduce population-weighted thermal risk by 11
to 13 percent, shrink the 95th-percentile (tail) risk by 7 to 17 percent, and
cut overheating hours by up to 9 percent. Beyond the synthetic demonstration,
the framework establishes a transferable foundation for real-city
implementation, linking physical hazard modeling with social equity and
decision intelligence. The H-RDT advances digital urban resilience toward
adaptive, learning-based, and equity-centered decision support for climate
adaptation.

TL;DR: 通过Hankel奇异值正则化，使状态空间模型更易于压缩，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决状态空间模型在训练后难以压缩的问题。

Method: 提出Hankel奇异值正则化方法，并开发高效计算算法。

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中，压缩性提高10倍，精度保持。

Conclusion: Hankel正则化有效提升状态空间模型的压缩性，适用于长序列任务。

Abstract: Deep neural networks using state space models as layers are well suited for
long-range sequence tasks but can be challenging to compress after training. We
use that regularizing the sum of Hankel singular values of state space models
leads to a fast decay of these singular values and thus to compressible models.
To make the proposed Hankel singular value regularization scalable, we develop
an algorithm to efficiently compute the Hankel singular values during training
iterations by exploiting the specific block-diagonal structure of the system
matrices that is we use in our state space model parametrization. Experiments
on Long Range Arena benchmarks demonstrate that the regularized state space
layers are up to 10$\times$ more compressible than standard state space layers
while maintaining high accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CKA在比较表示时未考虑流形结构且依赖启发式方法，导致其在不同数据规模下表现不一致。

Method: 提出MKA方法，将流形几何融入对齐任务，并推导了理论框架。

Result: 实验表明MKA在合成和真实数据集上比现有方法更鲁棒。

Conclusion: MKA为表示学习提供了更可靠的度量基础。

Abstract: Centered kernel alignment (CKA) is a popular metric for comparing
representations, determining equivalence of networks, and neuroscience
research. However, CKA does not account for the underlying manifold and relies
on numerous heuristics that cause it to behave differently at different scales
of data. In this work, we propose Manifold approximated Kernel Alignment (MKA),
which incorporates manifold geometry into the alignment task. We derive a
theoretical framework for MKA. We perform empirical evaluations on synthetic
datasets and real-world examples to characterize and compare MKA to its
contemporaries. Our findings suggest that manifold-aware kernel alignment
provides a more robust foundation for measuring representations, with potential
applications in representation learning.

TL;DR: SARNet结合ModernTCN和尖峰检测技术，提升剩余使用寿命预测的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型在故障起始点附近表现脆弱且缺乏物理解释性，SARNet旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用ModernTCN预测退化敏感指标，结合自适应阈值检测尖峰，并通过特征工程和RF-LGBM回归器生成最终RUL。

Result: 在基准数据集上，SARNet显著降低误差（RMSE 0.0365，MAE 0.0204），且轻量易部署。

Conclusion: SARNet在提升预测准确性的同时，兼具鲁棒性和可解释性，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of remaining useful life (RUL) is essential to enhance
system reliability and reduce maintenance risk. Yet many strong contemporary
models are fragile around fault onset and opaque to engineers: short,
high-energy spikes are smoothed away or misread, fixed thresholds blunt
sensitivity, and physics-based explanations are scarce. To remedy this, we
introduce SARNet (Spike-Aware Consecutive Validation Framework), which builds
on a Modern Temporal Convolutional Network (ModernTCN) and adds spike-aware
detection to provide physics-informed interpretability. ModernTCN forecasts
degradation-sensitive indicators; an adaptive consecutive threshold validates
true spikes while suppressing noise. Failure-prone segments then receive
targeted feature engineering (spectral slopes, statistical derivatives, energy
ratios), and the final RUL is produced by a stacked RF--LGBM regressor. Across
benchmark-ported datasets under an event-triggered protocol, SARNet
consistently lowers error compared to recent baselines (RMSE 0.0365, MAE
0.0204) while remaining lightweight, robust, and easy to deploy.

### [436] [The Reasoning Trap: How Enhancing LLM Reasoning Amplifies Tool Hallucination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22977)
*Chenlong Yin,Zeyang Sha,Shiwen Cui,Changhua Meng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现增强LLMs的推理能力会加剧工具幻觉，揭示了能力与可靠性之间的权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨推理能力增强是否会导致工具幻觉，填补研究空白。

Method: 使用SimpleToolHalluBench基准，通过控制实验验证推理增强与工具幻觉的因果关系。

Result: 推理增强与工具幻觉呈正相关，且不受任务类型或方法影响。

Conclusion: 当前推理增强方法需优化，以平衡能力与可靠性。

Abstract: Enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key
strategy for building Agents that "think then act." However, recent
observations, like OpenAI's o3, suggest a paradox: stronger reasoning often
coincides with increased hallucination, yet no prior work has systematically
examined whether reasoning enhancement itself causes tool hallucination. To
address this gap, we pose the central question: Does strengthening reasoning
increase tool hallucination? To answer this, we introduce SimpleToolHalluBench,
a diagnostic benchmark measuring tool hallucination in two failure modes: (i)
no tool available, and (ii) only distractor tools available. Through controlled
experiments, we establish three key findings. First, we demonstrate a causal
relationship: progressively enhancing reasoning through RL increases tool
hallucination proportionally with task performance gains. Second, this effect
transcends overfitting - training on non-tool tasks (e.g., mathematics) still
amplifies subsequent tool hallucination. Third, the effect is method-agnostic,
appearing when reasoning is instilled via supervised fine-tuning and when it is
merely elicited at inference by switching from direct answers to step-by-step
thinking. We also evaluate mitigation strategies including Prompt Engineering
and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), revealing a fundamental
reliability-capability trade-off: reducing hallucination consistently degrades
utility. Mechanistically, Reasoning RL disproportionately collapses
tool-reliability-related representations, and hallucinations surface as
amplified divergences concentrated in late-layer residual streams. These
findings reveal that current reasoning enhancement methods inherently amplify
tool hallucination, highlighting the need for new training objectives that
jointly optimize for capability and reliability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了谱感知矩阵值优化器（如Muon和Shampoo）在深度学习中的泛化性能，发现其在处理不平衡数据时优于传统欧几里得梯度下降（GD）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究谱优化器在深度学习中的表现，特别是在不平衡数据场景下，以理解其为何及何时优于传统优化算法。

Method: 通过引入简化抽象，如使用不平衡数据作为测试平台，研究谱梯度下降（SpecGD）的规范形式，并在高斯混合数据模型和线性/双线性模型中量化其性能。

Result: SpecGD能够均衡学习数据的所有主成分，而GD则优先学习主导成分，导致SpecGD在训练早期表现出更高的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: 谱优化器通过更均衡地学习数据底层成分，实现了更优的泛化性能，这一效应在深度模型中进一步放大。

Abstract: The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon
and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their
generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform
competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate
simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a
testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is
Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $U\Sigma
V^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we
identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD
outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both
linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning
dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal
components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a
growing gap in balanced accuracy favoring SpecGD early in training and further
show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive
step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models,
we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our
theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments
compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against
their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that
these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more
balanced learning of the data's underlying components.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为QoSMGAA的新架构，用于在复杂和嘈杂的网络服务环境中提高QoS预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QoS预测方法难以捕捉丰富的上下文信息，且在数据稀疏和结构噪声下表现不佳。

Method: QoSMGAA整合了多阶注意力机制和对抗神经网络，利用Gumbel-Softmax方法生成负样本。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集上的实验表明，QoSMGAA显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: QoSMGAA在服务选择和推荐场景中具有实际部署潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of internet technologies, network services have
become critical for delivering diverse and reliable applications to users.
However, the exponential growth in the number of available services has
resulted in many similar offerings, posing significant challenges in selecting
optimal services. Predicting Quality of Service (QoS) accurately thus becomes a
fundamental prerequisite for ensuring reliability and user satisfaction.
However, existing QoS prediction methods often fail to capture rich contextual
information and exhibit poor performance under extreme data sparsity and
structural noise. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel architecture, QoSMGAA,
specifically designed to enhance prediction accuracy in complex and noisy
network service environments. QoSMGAA integrates a multi-order attention
mechanism to aggregate extensive contextual data and predict missing QoS values
effectively. Additionally, our method incorporates adversarial neural networks
to perform autoregressive supervised learning based on transformed interaction
matrices. To capture complex, higher-order interactions among users and
services, we employ a discrete sampling technique leveraging the Gumbel-Softmax
method to generate informative negative samples. Comprehensive experimental
validation conducted on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrates that our
proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods,
highlighting its strong potential for practical deployment in service selection
and recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 现有等变模型仅适用于简单对称性（如旋转），无法处理科学领域中更广泛的线性变换（GL(n)）。

Method: 引入ReLNs，通过新型伴随不变双线性层实现稳定等变性，适用于Lie代数特征和矩阵输入。

Result: 在sl(3)、sp(4)对称性任务和Lorentz等变粒子物理任务中表现优异，3D无人机状态估计中显著提升轨迹精度。

Conclusion: ReLNs为Lie代数和矩阵数据上的广泛线性对称性学习提供了实用且通用的框架。

Abstract: Encoding symmetries is a powerful inductive bias for improving the
generalization of deep neural networks. However, most existing equivariant
models are limited to simple symmetries like rotations, failing to address the
broader class of general linear transformations, GL(n), that appear in many
scientific domains. We introduce Reductive Lie Neurons (ReLNs), a novel neural
network architecture exactly equivariant to these general linear symmetries.
ReLNs are designed to operate directly on a wide range of structured inputs,
including general n-by-n matrices. ReLNs introduce a novel adjoint-invariant
bilinear layer to achieve stable equivariance for both Lie-algebraic features
and matrix-valued inputs, without requiring redesign for each subgroup. This
architecture overcomes the limitations of prior equivariant networks that only
apply to compact groups or simple vector data. We validate ReLNs' versatility
across a spectrum of tasks: they outperform existing methods on algebraic
benchmarks with sl(3) and sp(4) symmetries and achieve competitive results on a
Lorentz-equivariant particle physics task. In 3D drone state estimation with
geometric uncertainty, ReLNs jointly process velocities and covariances,
yielding significant improvements in trajectory accuracy. ReLNs provide a
practical and general framework for learning with broad linear group symmetries
on Lie algebras and matrix-valued data. Project page:

Abstract: Random Forests (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) are two of the
most widely used and highly performing classification and regression models.
They aggregate equally weighted CART trees, generated randomly in RF or
sequentially in XGBoost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Forests (AF), a
novel approach that adaptively selects the weights of the underlying CART
models. AF combines (a) the Optimal Predictive-Policy Trees (OP2T) framework to
prescribe tailored, input-dependent unequal weights to trees and (b) Mixed
Integer Optimization (MIO) to refine weight candidates dynamically, enhancing
overall performance. We demonstrate that AF consistently outperforms RF,
XGBoost, and other weighted RF in binary and multi-class classification
problems over 20+ real-world datasets.

Conclusion: 示例与步骤的对齐是关键，改进方法验证了这一观点。

Abstract: Composing basic skills from simple tasks to accomplish composite tasks is
crucial for modern intelligent systems. We investigate the in-context
composition ability of language models to perform composite tasks that combine
basic skills demonstrated in in-context examples. This is more challenging than
the standard setting, where skills and their composition can be learned in
training. We conduct systematic experiments on various representative
open-source language models, utilizing linguistic and logical tasks designed to
probe composition abilities. The results reveal that simple task examples can
have a surprising negative impact on the performance, because the models
generally struggle to recognize and assemble the skills correctly, even with
Chain-of-Thought examples. Theoretical analysis further shows that it is
crucial to align examples with the corresponding steps in the composition. This
inspires a method for the probing tasks, whose improved performance provides
positive support for our insights.

Motivation: 现有理论通常假设softmax的Lipschitz常数为1，但缺乏全面的分析。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Result: softmax的Lipschitz常数确实为1/2，且这一结果直接改进了现有理论。

Conclusion: 本文为softmax的Lipschitz连续性提供了全面分析，并展示了其实际应用价值。

Abstract: The softmax function is a basic operator in machine learning and
optimization, used in classification, attention mechanisms, reinforcement
learning, game theory, and problems involving log-sum-exp terms. Existing
robustness guarantees of learning models and convergence analysis of
optimization algorithms typically consider the softmax operator to have a
Lipschitz constant of $1$ with respect to the $\ell_2$ norm. In this work, we
prove that the softmax function is contractive with the Lipschitz constant
$1/2$, uniformly across all $\ell_p$ norms with $p \ge 1$. We also show that
the local Lipschitz constant of softmax attains $1/2$ for $p = 1$ and $p =
\infty$, and for $p \in (1,\infty)$, the constant remains strictly below $1/2$
and the supremum $1/2$ is achieved only in the limit. To our knowledge, this is
the first comprehensive norm-uniform analysis of softmax Lipschitz continuity.
We demonstrate how the sharper constant directly improves a range of existing
theoretical results on robustness and convergence. We further validate the
sharpness of the $1/2$ Lipschitz constant of the softmax operator through
empirical studies on attention-based architectures (ViT, GPT-2, Qwen3-8B) and
on stochastic policies in reinforcement learning.

Result: 在三个知识图谱基准测试中，MoEMeta显著优于现有基线，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MoEMeta通过平衡全局泛化和局部适应能力，推动了小样本关系学习的进展。

Abstract: Few-shot knowledge graph relational learning seeks to perform reasoning over
relations given only a limited number of training examples. While existing
approaches largely adopt a meta-learning framework for enabling fast adaptation
to new relations, they suffer from two key pitfalls. First, they learn relation
meta-knowledge in isolation, failing to capture common relational patterns
shared across tasks. Second, they struggle to effectively incorporate local,
task-specific contexts crucial for rapid adaptation. To address these
limitations, we propose MoEMeta, a novel meta-learning framework that
disentangles globally shared knowledge from task-specific contexts to enable
both effective generalization and rapid adaptation. MoEMeta introduces two key
innovations: (i) a mixture-of-experts (MoE) model that learns globally shared
relational prototypes to enhance generalization, and (ii) a task-tailored
adaptation mechanism that captures local contexts for fast task-specific
adaptation. By balancing global generalization with local adaptability, MoEMeta
significantly advances few-shot relational learning. Extensive experiments and
analyses on three KG benchmarks demonstrate that MoEMeta consistently
outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习在IoT入侵检测系统中面临的类别不平衡、非独立同分布数据和高通信开销问题。

Method: 采用双模型架构（个性化教师模型和轻量级共享学生模型），结合双向知识蒸馏、多特征对齐和类别平衡损失函数。

Result: 在IoTID20和5GNIDD数据集上显著优于现有联邦学习方法，尤其在极端数据异构下表现优异。

Conclusion: Sentinel在保持通信效率的同时，提升了性能，为联邦学习在IoT入侵检测中的应用提供了新基准。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving paradigm for machine
learning, but its application in intrusion detection systems (IDS) within IoT
networks is challenged by severe class imbalance, non-IID data, and high
communication overhead.These challenges severely degrade the performance of
conventional FL methods in real-world network traffic classification. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Sentinel, a personalized federated IDS
(pFed-IDS) framework that incorporates a dual-model architecture on each
client, consisting of a personalized teacher and a lightweight shared student
model. This design effectively balances deep local adaptation with efficient
global model consensus while preserving client privacy by transmitting only the
compact student model, thus reducing communication costs. Sentinel integrates
three key mechanisms to ensure robust performance: bidirectional knowledge
distillation with adaptive temperature scaling, multi-faceted feature
alignment, and class-balanced loss functions. Furthermore, the server employs
normalized gradient aggregation with equal client weighting to enhance fairness
and mitigate client drift. Extensive experiments on the IoTID20 and 5GNIDD
benchmark datasets demonstrate that Sentinel significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art federated methods, establishing a new performance benchmark,
especially under extreme data heterogeneity, while maintaining communication
efficiency.

Abstract: Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have substantially improved
the training of large-scale language models, leading to significant gains in
generation quality and reasoning ability. However, most existing research
focuses on dense models, while RL training for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
architectures remains underexplored. To address the instability commonly
observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize
importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a
rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient
variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the
final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic
innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction
for efficient training of large-scale expert models.

Result: ANN草图在流模型中实现了亚线性内存和查询时间；A-KDE草图在滑动窗口模型中首次实现了理论亚线性保证。

Conclusion: 实验验证了草图算法的轻量级和低误差特性，为动态数据流中的ANN和A-KDE问题提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search and Approximate Kernel Density
Estimation (A-KDE) are fundamental problems at the core of modern machine
learning, with broad applications in data analysis, information systems, and
large-scale decision making. In massive and dynamic data streams, a central
challenge is to design compact sketches that preserve essential structural
properties of the data while enabling efficient queries.
  In this work, we develop new sketching algorithms that achieve sublinear
space and query time guarantees for both ANN and A-KDE for a dynamic stream of
data. For ANN in the streaming model, under natural assumptions, we design a
sublinear sketch that requires only $\mathcal{O}(n^{1+\rho-\eta})$ memory by
storing only a sublinear ($n^{-\eta}$) fraction of the total inputs, where
$\rho$ is a parameter of the LSH family, and $0<\eta<1$. Our method supports
sublinear query time, batch queries, and extends to the more general Turnstile
model. While earlier works have focused on Exact NN, this is the first result
on ANN that achieves near-optimal trade-offs between memory size and
approximation error.
  Next, for A-KDE in the Sliding-Window model, we propose a sketch of size
$\mathcal{O}\left(RW \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\epsilon} - 1} \log^2 N\right)$,
where $R$ is the number of sketch rows, $W$ is the LSH range, $N$ is the window
size, and $\epsilon$ is the approximation error. This, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first theoretical sublinear sketch guarantee for A-KDE in the
Sliding-Window model.
  We complement our theoretical results with experiments on various real-world
datasets, which show that the proposed sketches are lightweight and achieve
consistently low error in practice.

TL;DR: CrysLLMGen结合LLM和扩散模型，生成新颖且稳定的晶体材料。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（LLM或去噪模型）在生成晶体结构时各有不足，需结合两者优势。

Method: 先使用LLM生成原子类型、坐标和晶格结构，再用扩散模型优化坐标和晶格。

Result: 在多个任务中表现优于现有方法，生成更稳定、新颖的材料。

Conclusion: CrysLLMGen在结构和组成有效性上表现平衡，且支持条件生成。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have shown significant promise in
designing novel periodic crystal structures. Existing approaches typically rely
on either large language models (LLMs) or equivariant denoising models, each
with complementary strengths: LLMs excel at handling discrete atomic types but
often struggle with continuous features such as atomic positions and lattice
parameters, while denoising models are effective at modeling continuous
variables but encounter difficulties in generating accurate atomic
compositions. To bridge this gap, we propose CrysLLMGen, a hybrid framework
that integrates an LLM with a diffusion model to leverage their complementary
strengths for crystal material generation. During sampling, CrysLLMGen first
employs a fine-tuned LLM to produce an intermediate representation of atom
types, atomic coordinates, and lattice structure. While retaining the predicted
atom types, it passes the atomic coordinates and lattice structure to a
pre-trained equivariant diffusion model for refinement. Our framework
outperforms state-of-the-art generative models across several benchmark tasks
and datasets. Specifically, CrysLLMGen not only achieves a balanced performance
in terms of structural and compositional validity but also generates more
stable and novel materials compared to LLM-based and denoisingbased models
Furthermore, CrysLLMGen exhibits strong conditional generation capabilities,
effectively producing materials that satisfy user-defined constraints. Code is

Motivation: 解决Pass@K目标下两种看似不同的策略梯度优化方法的矛盾，揭示其内在联系。

Method: 通过反向工程分析优势塑造技术，将其解释为隐式优化替代奖励；同时从替代奖励目标出发推导新的优势塑造方法。

Result: 证明两种方法本质相同，并提供了统一的理论框架。

Conclusion: 这一视角不仅适用于Pass@K目标，还为更广泛的RLVR策略梯度优化提供了新思路。

Abstract: This note reconciles two seemingly distinct approaches to policy gradient
optimization for the Pass@K objective in reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards: (1) direct REINFORCE-style methods, and (2) advantage-shaping
techniques that directly modify GRPO. We show that these are two sides of the
same coin. By reverse-engineering existing advantage-shaping algorithms, we
reveal that they implicitly optimize surrogate rewards. We specifically
interpret practical ``hard-example up-weighting'' modifications to GRPO as
reward-level regularization. Conversely, starting from surrogate reward
objectives, we provide a simple recipe for deriving both existing and new
advantage-shaping methods. This perspective provides a lens for RLVR policy
gradient optimization beyond our original motivation of Pass@K.

Motivation: 预训练模型在下游任务中表现优异，但逐个微调以选择最佳模型耗时且低效。

Method: 采用学习引导方法，利用双编码器架构嵌入时间序列和模型特征，计算兼容性分数，并引入动态专家权重调整和跨任务学习增强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SwiftTS通过高效的数据-模型匹配和泛化增强模块，显著提升了时间序列预训练模型选择的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Pre-trained models exhibit strong generalization to various downstream tasks.
However, given the numerous models available in the model hub, identifying the
most suitable one by individually fine-tuning is time-consuming. In this paper,
we propose \textbf{SwiftTS}, a swift selection framework for time series
pre-trained models. To avoid expensive forward propagation through all
candidates, SwiftTS adopts a learning-guided approach that leverages historical
dataset-model performance pairs across diverse horizons to predict model
performance on unseen datasets. It employs a lightweight dual-encoder
architecture that embeds time series and candidate models with rich
characteristics, computing patchwise compatibility scores between data and
model embeddings for efficient selection. To further enhance the generalization
across datasets and horizons, we introduce a horizon-adaptive expert
composition module that dynamically adjusts expert weights, and the
transferable cross-task learning with cross-dataset and cross-horizon task
sampling to enhance out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness. Extensive experiments
on 14 downstream datasets and 8 pre-trained models demonstrate that SwiftTS
achieves state-of-the-art performance in time series pre-trained model
selection.

Motivation: 解决多无人机协同MEC系统中动态和不确定环境下的协调问题，克服现有方法在可扩展性、收敛速度和知识共享效率上的不足。

Method: 设计了双层动态图注意力网络、双Actor单Critic架构以及基于信誉的分散联邦学习机制。

Result: 实验显示，AirFed在加权成本、截止时间满足率和设备覆盖率上显著优于基线，同时减少了通信开销。

Conclusion: AirFed在大规模无人机-MEC部署中表现出强大的实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) cooperative Mobile Edge Computing
(MEC) systems face critical challenges in coordinating trajectory planning,
task offloading, and resource allocation while ensuring Quality of Service
(QoS) under dynamic and uncertain environments. Existing approaches suffer from
limited scalability, slow convergence, and inefficient knowledge sharing among
UAVs, particularly when handling large-scale IoT device deployments with
stringent deadline constraints. This paper proposes AirFed, a novel federated
graph-enhanced multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that addresses
these challenges through three key innovations. First, we design dual-layer
dynamic Graph Attention Networks (GATs) that explicitly model spatial-temporal
dependencies among UAVs and IoT devices, capturing both service relationships
and collaborative interactions within the network topology. Second, we develop
a dual-Actor single-Critic architecture that jointly optimizes continuous
trajectory control and discrete task offloading decisions. Third, we propose a
reputation-based decentralized federated learning mechanism with
gradient-sensitive adaptive quantization, enabling efficient and robust
knowledge sharing across heterogeneous UAVs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that AirFed achieves 42.9% reduction in weighted cost compared to
state-of-the-art baselines, attains over 99% deadline satisfaction and 94.2%
IoT device coverage rate, and reduces communication overhead by 54.5%.
Scalability analysis confirms robust performance across varying UAV numbers,
IoT device densities, and system scales, validating AirFed's practical
applicability for large-scale UAV-MEC deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要从目标分布采样或计算配分函数，TCSIS通过提出目标具体分数恒等式，避免了这些需求。

Method: 利用前向均匀扩散核的Boltzmann因子期望比来估计具体分数，并用神经网络近似具体分数，提出了两种算法：自归一化和无偏TCSIS。

Result: 在统计物理问题上验证了TCSIS的有效性。

Conclusion: TCSIS提供了一种无需目标分布采样或配分函数计算的高效采样方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Target Concrete Score Identity Sampler (TCSIS), a method for
sampling from unnormalized densities on discrete state spaces by learning the
reverse dynamics of a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC). Our approach builds
on a forward in time CTMC with a uniform noising kernel and relies on the
proposed Target Concrete Score Identity, which relates the concrete score, the
ratio of marginal probabilities of two states, to a ratio of expectations of
Boltzmann factors under the forward uniform diffusion kernel. This formulation
enables Monte Carlo estimation of the concrete score without requiring samples
from the target distribution or computation of the partition function. We
approximate the concrete score with a neural network and propose two
algorithms: Self-Normalized TCSIS and Unbiased TCSIS. Finally, we demonstrate
the effectiveness of TCSIS on problems from statistical physics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即神经算子或PDE模拟器的性能受限于训练数据的精度。

Method: 通过理论分析和实验验证，研究神经网络在多步预测中如何通过归纳偏置和训练目标超越训练数据的限制。

Result: 实验证明，神经网络可以隐式学习比训练数据更正则化的动态，甚至在某些情况下超越训练数据的物理保真度。

Conclusion: 神经模拟器可能在特定操作范围内实现比训练数据更高的物理保真度，需重新评估其基准测试方法。

Abstract: Neural operators or emulators for PDEs trained on data from numerical solvers
are conventionally assumed to be limited by their training data's fidelity. We
challenge this assumption by identifying "emulator superiority," where neural
networks trained purely on low-fidelity solver data can achieve higher accuracy
than those solvers when evaluated against a higher-fidelity reference. Our
theoretical analysis reveals how the interplay between emulator inductive
biases, training objectives, and numerical error characteristics enables
superior performance during multi-step rollouts. We empirically validate this
finding across different PDEs using standard neural architectures,
demonstrating that emulators can implicitly learn dynamics that are more
regularized or exhibit more favorable error accumulation properties than their
training data, potentially surpassing training data limitations and mitigating
numerical artifacts. This work prompts a re-evaluation of emulator
benchmarking, suggesting neural emulators might achieve greater physical
fidelity than their training source within specific operational regimes.

Conclusion: PINNs在数据有限情况下能可靠预测结构重量，有助于轻量桥梁设计的早期失效分析。

Abstract: Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are gaining attention for their
ability to embed physical laws into deep learning models, which is particularly
useful in structural engineering tasks with limited data. This paper aims to
explore the use of PINNs to predict the weight of small scale spaghetti
bridges, a task relevant to understanding load limits and potential failure
modes in simplified structural models. Our proposed framework incorporates
physics-based constraints to the prediction model for improved performance. In
addition to standard PINNs, we introduce a novel architecture named Physics
Informed Kolmogorov Arnold Network (PIKAN), which blends universal function
approximation theory with physical insights. The structural parameters provided
as input to the model are collected either manually or through computer vision
methods. Our dataset includes 15 real bridges, augmented to 100 samples, and
our best model achieves an $R^2$ score of 0.9603 and a mean absolute error
(MAE) of 10.50 units. From applied perspective, we also provide a web based
interface for parameter entry and prediction. These results show that PINNs can
offer reliable estimates of structural weight, even with limited data, and may
help inform early stage failure analysis in lightweight bridge designs.

Result: 在稳定测量和脑电图数据上验证，假阳性率低于2%，可靠性超过99%。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同领域有效检测异常，具有高可靠性和低假阳性率。

Abstract: Outlier detection is an important problem occurring in a wide range of areas.
Outliers are the outcome of fraudulent behaviour, mechanical faults, human
error, or simply natural deviations. Many data mining applications perform
outlier detection, often as a preliminary step in order to filter out outliers
and build more representative models. In this paper, we propose an outlier
detection method based on a clustering process. The aim behind the proposal
outlined in this paper is to overcome the specificity of many existing outlier
detection techniques that fail to take into account the inherent dispersion of
domain objects. The outlier detection method is based on four criteria designed
to represent how human beings (experts in each domain) visually identify
outliers within a set of objects after analysing the clusters. This has an
advantage over other clustering-based outlier detection techniques that are
founded on a purely numerical analysis of clusters. Our proposal has been
evaluated, with satisfactory results, on data (particularly time series) from
two different domains: stabilometry, a branch of medicine studying
balance-related functions in human beings and electroencephalography (EEG), a
neurological exploration used to diagnose nervous system disorders. To validate
the proposed method, we studied method outlier detection and efficiency in
terms of runtime. The results of regression analyses confirm that our proposal
is useful for detecting outlier data in different domains, with a false
positive rate of less than 2% and a reliability greater than 99%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过建立GSPO的重要性权重与信息论量之间的联系，提供更深入的理解。

Method: 将GSPO的序列级权重表示为困惑度比和交叉熵变化，并进行数学等价性验证。

Result: 实验验证了数学等价性，并解释了GSPO的方差减少和训练稳定性。

Conclusion: GSPO的重要性权重具有信息论解释，有助于理解其经验性质。

Abstract: We provide a new perspective on GSPO's length-normalized importance ratios by
establishing their connection to information-theoretic quantities. We show that
GSPO's sequence-level weight $s(\theta) =
(\pi_\theta/\pi_{\theta_{\text{old}}})^{1/|y|}$ can be equivalently expressed
as the inverse perplexity ratio
$\text{PPL}_{\theta_{\text{old}}}/\text{PPL}_\theta$ and as the exponential
cross-entropy change $\exp(\Delta H)$. While the perplexity-entropy
relationship follows from standard definitions, this observation provides a
useful lens for understanding GSPO: the algorithm weights policy gradient
updates by perplexity ratios, offering an information-theoretic interpretation
of the importance weights. This perspective helps explain GSPO's empirical
properties, including log-domain variance reduction through geometric averaging
and stability in training mixture-of-experts models. We validate the
mathematical equivalences and variance predictions through controlled
experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks.

Motivation: 传统架构将感知与决策分离，导致效率低下，无法直接反馈优化感知模块。

Result: 在BabyAI GoToLocal环境中表现优于PPO基线，奖励更稳定且对齐更强。

Conclusion: PDiT为开发更集成的自主智能体提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning agents often struggle when tasks require
understanding both vision and language. Conventional architectures typically
isolate perception (for example, CNN-based visual encoders) from
decision-making (policy networks). This separation can be inefficient, since
the policy's failures do not directly help the perception module learn what is
important. To address this, we implement the Perception-Decision Interleaving
Transformer (PDiT) architecture introduced by Mao et al. (2023), a model that
alternates between perception and decision layers within a single transformer.
This interleaving allows feedback from decision-making to refine perceptual
features dynamically. In addition, we integrate a contrastive loss inspired by
CLIP to align textual mission embeddings with visual scene features. We
evaluate the PDiT encoders on the BabyAI GoToLocal environment and find that
the approach achieves more stable rewards and stronger alignment compared to a
standard PPO baseline. The results suggest that interleaved transformer
encoders are a promising direction for developing more integrated autonomous
agents.

Result: 在FPGA上实现低延迟（6.83-9.22 ms）和高精度（0.949-0.970），能耗低于1.2 mJ/次。

Conclusion: 该方法适合长期边缘计算部署，平衡了精度、延迟和能耗。

Abstract: The growing demand for smart home interfaces has increased interest in
non-intrusive sensing methods like vibration-based gesture recognition. While
prior studies demonstrated feasibility, they often rely on complex
preprocessing and large Neural Networks (NNs) requiring costly high-performance
hardware, resulting in high energy usage and limited real-world deployability.
This study proposes an energy-efficient solution deploying compact NNs on
low-power Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to enable real-time gesture
recognition with competitive accuracy. We adopt a series of optimizations: (1)
We replace complex spectral preprocessing with raw waveform input, eliminating
complex on-board preprocessing while reducing input size by 21x without
sacrificing accuracy. (2) We design two lightweight architectures (1D-CNN and
1D-SepCNN) tailored for embedded FPGAs, reducing parameters from 369 million to
as few as 216 while maintaining comparable accuracy. (3) With integer-only
quantization and automated RTL generation, we achieve seamless FPGA deployment.
A ping-pong buffering mechanism in 1D-SepCNN further improves deployability
under tight memory constraints. (4) We extend a hardware-aware search framework
to support constraint-driven model configuration selection, considering
accuracy, deployability, latency, and energy consumption. Evaluated on two
swipe-direction datasets with multiple users and ordinary tables, our approach
achieves low-latency, energy-efficient inference on the AMD Spartan-7 XC7S25
FPGA. Under the PS data splitting setting, the selected 6-bit 1D-CNN reaches
0.970 average accuracy across users with 9.22 ms latency. The chosen 8-bit
1D-SepCNN further reduces latency to 6.83 ms (over 53x CPU speedup) with
slightly lower accuracy (0.949). Both consume under 1.2 mJ per inference,
demonstrating suitability for long-term edge operation.

Conclusion: 研究为预测性基准测试的科学有效性提供了理论基础，强调了其在机器学习中的概念和理论推理重要性。

Abstract: Predictive benchmarking, the evaluation of machine learning models based on
predictive performance and competitive ranking, is a central epistemic practice
in machine learning research and an increasingly prominent method for
scientific inquiry. Yet, benchmark scores alone provide at best measurements of
model performance relative to an evaluation dataset and a concrete learning
problem. Drawing substantial scientific inferences from the results, say about
theoretical tasks like image classification, requires additional assumptions
about the theoretical structure of the learning problems, evaluation functions,
and data distributions. We make these assumptions explicit by developing
conditions of construct validity inspired by psychological measurement theory.
We examine these assumptions in practice through three case studies, each
exemplifying a typical intended inference: measuring engineering progress in
computer vision with ImageNet; evaluating policy-relevant weather predictions
with WeatherBench; and examining limitations of the predictability of life
events with the Fragile Families Challenge. Our framework clarifies the
conditions under which benchmark scores can support diverse scientific claims,
bringing predictive benchmarking into perspective as an epistemological
practice and a key site of conceptual and theoretical reasoning in machine
learning.

Result: 在英语/阿拉伯语到法语的多语言设置中，PTPP感知方法在未见PTPP下预测目标损失优于基线。

Conclusion: PTPP感知方法不仅可用于预测，还能在实际应用中规划回放比例和适应预算。

Abstract: Continual pre-training (CPT) for domain adaptation must balance target-domain
gains with stability on the base domain. Existing CPT scaling laws typically
assume a fixed pre-training budget, which limits their ability to forecast
adaptation outcomes for models trained at different tokens-per-parameter
(PTPP). We present \emph{PTPP-aware} adaptation scaling laws that make the
pre-training budget an explicit variable, enabling accurate \emph{prediction}
of adaptation loss at unseen \ptpp. On a multilingual setup (English/Arabic
$\rightarrow$ French), PTPP-aware formulations trained on early stages
(\ptpp{}=\{15,31\}) predict target loss at \ptpp{}=279 and outperform a
PTPP-agnostic \dcpt{} transfer baseline on metrics (Huber-on-log,
MAE$_\mathrm{rel}$, calibration slope); full diagnostics (RMSE, MAPE) are in
the appendix. Beyond forecasting, we show a practical use case: planning replay
ratios and adaptation token budgets that satisfy target and forgetting
constraints under compute limits.

Conclusion: 推理中心的合成数据生成是提升LLM编码能力的有效方法，数据集和管道已公开。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive promise in code
generation, yet their progress remains limited by the shortage of large-scale
datasets that are both diverse and well-aligned with human reasoning. Most
existing resources pair problems with solutions, but omit the intermediate
thought process that guides coding. To close this gap, we present a scalable
synthetic data generation pipeline that produces nearly 800k
instruction-reasoning-code-test quadruplets. Each sample combines a task, a
step-by-step reasoning trace, a working solution, and executable tests,
enabling models to learn not just the what but also the how of problem solving.
Our pipeline combines four key components: curated contest problems, web-mined
content filtered by relevance classifiers, data expansion guided by reasoning
patterns, and multi-stage execution-based validation. A genetic mutation
algorithm further increases task diversity while maintaining consistency
between reasoning traces and code implementations. Our key finding is that
fine-tuning LLMs on this dataset yields consistent improvements on coding
benchmarks. Beyond raw accuracy, reasoning-aware data can substitute for model
scaling, generalize across architectures, and outperform leading open-source
alternatives under identical sample budgets. Our work establishes
reasoning-centered synthetic data generation as an efficient approach for
advancing coding capabilities in LLMs. We publish our dataset and generation
pipeline to facilitate further research.

Result: 实验结果表明，SCSF比传统数值求解器快3.5倍。

Conclusion: SCSF是首个加速特征值数据生成的方法，显著提升了效率。

Abstract: Eigenvalue problems are among the most important topics in many scientific
disciplines. With the recent surge and development of machine learning, neural
eigenvalue methods have attracted significant attention as a forward pass of
inference requires only a tiny fraction of the computation time compared to
traditional solvers. However, a key limitation is the requirement for large
amounts of labeled data in training, including operators and their eigenvalues.
To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel method, named Sorting Chebyshev
Subspace Filter (SCSF), which significantly accelerates eigenvalue data
generation by leveraging similarities between operators -- a factor overlooked
by existing methods. Specifically, SCSF employs truncated fast Fourier
transform sorting to group operators with similar eigenvalue distributions and
constructs a Chebyshev subspace filter that leverages eigenpairs from
previously solved problems to assist in solving subsequent ones, reducing
redundant computations. To the best of our knowledge, SCSF is the first method
to accelerate eigenvalue data generation. Experimental results show that SCSF
achieves up to a $3.5\times$ speedup compared to various numerical solvers.

Method: 基于Grassmann流形上的Riemannian插值，提出了一种低通图滤波器插值算法。

Result: 推导了子空间插值的误差界限，并提出了两种应用：调整网络同质性程度的相似性校正和改进节点分类的消息传递方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为参数化图族的低通滤波器计算提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-pass graph filters are fundamental for signal processing on graphs and
other non-Euclidean domains. However, the computation of such filters for
parametric graph families can be prohibitively expensive as computation of the
corresponding low-frequency subspaces, requires the repeated solution of an
eigenvalue problem. We suggest a novel algorithm of low-pass graph filter
interpolation based on Riemannian interpolation in normal coordinates on the
Grassmann manifold. We derive an error bound estimate for the subspace
interpolation and suggest two possible applications for induced parametric
graph families. First, we argue that the temporal evolution of the node
features may be translated to the evolving graph topology via a similarity
correction to adjust the homophily degree of the network. Second, we suggest a
dot product graph family induced by a given static graph which allows to infer
improved message passing scheme for node classification facilitated by the
filter interpolation.

Motivation: 现有HQMM学习算法对数据损坏敏感且缺乏对抗性扰动的鲁棒性机制。

Result: RILA在多个基准测试中表现出更好的收敛稳定性、抗损坏能力和物理有效性保持。

Conclusion: RILA为量子序列学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的方法。

Abstract: Hidden Quantum Markov Models (HQMMs) extend classical Hidden Markov Models to
the quantum domain, offering a powerful probabilistic framework for modeling
sequential data with quantum coherence. However, existing HQMM learning
algorithms are highly sensitive to data corruption and lack mechanisms to
ensure robustness under adversarial perturbations. In this work, we introduce
the Adversarially Corrupted HQMM (AC-HQMM), which formalizes robustness
analysis by allowing a controlled fraction of observation sequences to be
adversarially corrupted. To learn AC-HQMMs, we propose the Robust Iterative
Learning Algorithm (RILA), a derivative-free method that integrates a Remove
Corrupted Rows by Entropy Filtering (RCR-EF) module with an iterative
stochastic resampling procedure for physically valid Kraus operator updates.
RILA incorporates L1-penalized likelihood objectives to enhance stability,
resist overfitting, and remain effective under non-differentiable conditions.
Across multiple HQMM and HMM benchmarks, RILA demonstrates superior convergence
stability, corruption resilience, and preservation of physical validity
compared to existing algorithms, establishing a principled and efficient
approach for robust quantum sequential learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统聚类算法在高维和非均匀分布数据中表现不佳，尤其是低密度边界样本易受干扰，导致聚类结果不稳定。

Method: GCAO通过群体级优化机制，将低密度边界点聚集成协作移动的群体，结合局部密度估计和邻域拓扑，构建有效的引力相互作用。

Result: 在多个高维数据集上，GCAO优于11种代表性聚类方法，平均性能提升显著。

Conclusion: GCAO在保持聚类完整性、增强边界可分性和鲁棒性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Traditional clustering algorithms often struggle with high-dimensional and
non-uniformly distributed data, where low-density boundary samples are easily
disturbed by neighboring clusters, leading to unstable and distorted clustering
results. To address this issue, we propose a Group-driven Clustering via
Gravitational Attraction and Optimization (GCAO) algorithm. GCAO introduces a
group-level optimization mechanism that aggregates low-density boundary points
into collaboratively moving groups, replacing the traditional point-based
contraction process. By combining local density estimation with neighborhood
topology, GCAO constructs effective gravitational interactions between groups
and their surroundings, enhancing boundary clarity and structural consistency.
Using groups as basic motion units, a gravitational contraction strategy
ensures globally stable and directionally consistent convergence. Experiments
on multiple high-dimensional datasets demonstrate that GCAO outperforms 11
representative clustering methods, achieving average improvements of 37.13%,
52.08%, 44.98%, and 38.81% in NMI, ARI, Homogeneity, and ACC, respectively,
while maintaining competitive efficiency and scalability. These results
highlight GCAO's superiority in preserving cluster integrity, enhancing
boundary separability, and ensuring robust performance on complex data
distributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列分割评估指标（如ARI）无法全面反映分割质量，且忽略错误类型和位置。

Method: 引入WARI（加权调整兰德指数）和SMS（状态匹配分数），分别考虑错误位置和四种基本错误类型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证，WARI和SMS能更准确评估分割质量并提供错误来源和类型的洞察。

Conclusion: 新指标WARI和SMS弥补了传统指标的不足，为时间序列分割提供了更全面和可解释的评估方法。

Abstract: Time series segmentation is a fundamental task in analyzing temporal data
across various domains, from human activity recognition to energy monitoring.
While numerous state-of-the-art methods have been developed to tackle this
problem, the evaluation of their performance remains critically limited.
Existing measures predominantly focus on change point accuracy or rely on
point-based measures such as Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), which fail to capture
the quality of the detected segments, ignore the nature of errors, and offer
limited interpretability. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by
introducing two novel evaluation measures: WARI (Weighted Adjusted Rand Index),
that accounts for the position of segmentation errors, and SMS (State Matching
Score), a fine-grained measure that identifies and scores four fundamental
types of segmentation errors while allowing error-specific weighting. We
empirically validate WARI and SMS on synthetic and real-world benchmarks,
showing that they not only provide a more accurate assessment of segmentation
quality but also uncover insights, such as error provenance and type, that are
inaccessible with traditional measures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ACDC方法在大语言模型上效率低下，线性近似方法牺牲了分析准确性。

Method: PAHQ利用激活修补与混合精度量化的对齐，仅对研究组件保持高精度，其余部分降低精度。

Result: PAHQ将ACDC运行时间减少80%，内存消耗降低30%，同时保持准确性。

Conclusion: PAHQ为加速机制解释性方法提供了实用且新颖的途径，无需训练即可集成现有技术。

Abstract: Circuit discovery, which involves identifying sparse and task-relevant
subnetworks in pre-trained language models, is a cornerstone of mechanistic
interpretability. Automated Circuit Discovery (ACDC) has emerged as a pivotal
methodology in circuit discovery, but its application to large language models
is severely limited by computational inefficiency and prohibitively high memory
requirements. Although several accelerated approaches have been proposed, they
primarily rely on linear approximations to ACDC, which significantly
compromises analytical faithfulness. Our proposed method for accelerating
automated circuit discovery, Per Attention Head Quantization (PAHQ), takes a
fundamentally different approach by optimizing the efficiency of each
individual patching operation. PAHQ leverages a fundamental alignment between
activation patching and mixed-precision quantization (MPQ): interpretability
analysis through patching essentially performs targeted ablation studies.
Therefore, we can maintain high precision exclusively for investigated
components while safely reducing precision elsewhere in the network.
PAHQ-accelerated ACDC reduces runtime by up to 80\% and memory consumption by
up to 30\% compared to unaccelerated ACDC while maintaining faithfulness.
Importantly, our method readily integrates with existing edge-based circuit
discovery techniques by modifying the attention computation mechanism. This
training-free approach provides a practical and novel pathway for accelerating
mechanistic interpretability methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: DAMPE框架通过OT对齐和CGG融合解决蛋白质功能预测中的多模态异质性和噪声问题，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 蛋白质功能预测需整合多模态数据，但存在跨模态分布不匹配和噪声图数据问题。

Method: 提出DAMPE框架，结合OT对齐和CGG融合方法。

Result: 在标准GO基准上优于现有方法，AUPR和Fmax显著提升。

Conclusion: DAMPE为多模态蛋白质表示学习提供了可扩展的理论基础，显著提升预测性能。

Abstract: Accurate protein function prediction requires integrating heterogeneous
intrinsic signals (e.g., sequence and structure) with noisy extrinsic contexts
(e.g., protein-protein interactions and GO term annotations). However, two key
challenges hinder effective fusion: (i) cross-modal distributional mismatch
among embeddings produced by pre-trained intrinsic encoders, and (ii) noisy
relational graphs of extrinsic data that degrade GNN-based information
aggregation. We propose Diffused and Aligned Multi-modal Protein Embedding
(DAMPE), a unified framework that addresses these through two core mechanisms.
First, we propose Optimal Transport (OT)-based representation alignment that
establishes correspondence between intrinsic embedding spaces of different
modalities, effectively mitigating cross-modal heterogeneity. Second, we
develop a Conditional Graph Generation (CGG)-based information fusion method,
where a condition encoder fuses the aligned intrinsic embeddings to provide
informative cues for graph reconstruction. Meanwhile, our theoretical analysis
implies that the CGG objective drives this condition encoder to absorb
graph-aware knowledge into its produced protein representations. Empirically,
DAMPE outperforms or matches state-of-the-art methods such as DPFunc on
standard GO benchmarks, achieving AUPR gains of 0.002-0.013 pp and Fmax gains
0.004-0.007 pp. Ablation studies further show that OT-based alignment
contributes 0.043-0.064 pp AUPR, while CGG-based fusion adds 0.005-0.111 pp
Fmax. Overall, DAMPE offers a scalable and theoretically grounded approach for
robust multi-modal protein representation learning, substantially enhancing
protein function prediction.

TL;DR: Torsor CNNs框架用于处理具有局部对称性的图数据，通过边势能实现局部坐标系的变换，并证明了其与群同步问题的等价性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有等变神经网络仅依赖全局对称性，无法处理局部对称性问题。

Method: 提出Torsor CNNs框架，包含Torsor卷积层和frustration损失函数，适用于任意图结构。

Result: 框架统一了多种架构（如经典CNN和Gauge CNN），并在多视角3D识别中验证有效性。

Conclusion: Torsor CNNs为局部对称性学习提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Most equivariant neural networks rely on a single global symmetry, limiting
their use in domains where symmetries are instead local. We introduce Torsor
CNNs, a framework for learning on graphs with local symmetries encoded as edge
potentials-- group-valued transformations between neighboring coordinate
frames. We establish that this geometric construction is fundamentally
equivalent to the classical group synchronization problem, yielding: (1) a
Torsor Convolutional Layer that is provably equivariant to local changes in
coordinate frames, and (2) the frustration loss--a standalone geometric
regularizer that encourages locally equivariant representations when added to
any NN's training objective. The Torsor CNN framework unifies and generalizes
several architectures--including classical CNNs and Gauge CNNs on manifolds--
by operating on arbitrary graphs without requiring a global coordinate system
or smooth manifold structure. We establish the mathematical foundations of this
framework and demonstrate its applicability to multi-view 3D recognition, where
relative camera poses naturally define the required edge potentials.

Abstract: We introduce MIO, a transformer-based model for inferring symbolic ordinary

transformer-based symbolic regression, the model effectively leverages repeated
observations of the same system to learn more generalizable representations of

strategies and show that even simple mean aggregation can substantially boost
performance. MIO is evaluated on systems ranging from one to four dimensions
and under varying noise levels, consistently outperforming existing baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播（BP）在能源效率和生物合理性上存在问题，预测编码（PC）作为一种潜在的更高效算法，其优势尚未完全实现，且深层PC网络难以训练。

Method: 通过优化理论分析PC的学习动态，提出PC近似使用二阶信息的信任域方法，并进一步展示了PC可以利用更高阶信息。此外，提出了一种新的参数化方法μPC。

Result: PC的学习动态可以近似为使用二阶信息的信任域方法，且PC能够利用更高阶信息。μPC首次实现了100+层网络的稳定训练，并在简单任务上表现优异。

Conclusion: 该论文显著提升了对PC网络推理和学习动态的理解，但未来研究需关注硬件协同设计，以推动PC在大规模应用中的竞争力。

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) is the standard algorithm for training the deep neural
networks that power modern artificial intelligence including large language
models. However, BP is energy inefficient and unlikely to be implemented by the
brain. This thesis studies an alternative, potentially more efficient
brain-inspired algorithm called predictive coding (PC). Unlike BP, PC networks
(PCNs) perform inference by iterative equilibration of neuron activities before
learning or weight updates. Recent work has suggested that this iterative
inference procedure provides a range of benefits over BP, such as faster
training. However, these advantages have not been consistently observed, the
inference and learning dynamics of PCNs are still poorly understood, and deep
PCNs remain practically untrainable. Here, we make significant progress towards
scaling PCNs by taking a theoretical approach grounded in optimisation theory.
First, we show that the learning dynamics of PC can be understood as an
approximate trust-region method using second-order information, despite
explicitly using only first-order local updates. Second, going beyond this
approximation, we show that PC can in principle make use of arbitrarily
higher-order information, such that for feedforward networks the effective
landscape on which PC learns is far more benign and robust to vanishing
gradients than the (mean squared error) loss landscape. Third, motivated by a
study of the inference dynamics of PCNs, we propose a new parameterisation
called ``$\mu$PC'', which for the first time allows stable training of 100+
layer networks with little tuning and competitive performance on simple tasks.
Overall, this thesis significantly advances our fundamental understanding of
the inference and learning dynamics of PCNs, while highlighting the need for
future research to focus on hardware co-design if PC is to compete with BP at
scale.

Motivation: 自动驾驶车辆传感器数据的可靠性对安全至关重要，需要高效的实时异常检测方法。

Result: GRAD在异常检测和分类中表现优异，F1-score达97.6%（异常数据）和99.4%（正常数据），计算开销低。

Conclusion: GRAD是一种高效可靠的实时异常检测解决方案，适用于自动驾驶系统，保障安全且计算开销低。

Abstract: This paper introduces GRAD, a real-time anomaly detection method for
autonomous vehicle sensors that integrates statistical analysis and deep
learning to ensure the reliability of sensor data. The proposed approach
combines the Reinforced Exponential Moving Average (REMA), which adapts
smoothing factors and thresholding for outlier detection, with the Multi-Stage
Sliding Window (MS-SW) technique for capturing both short- and long-term
patterns. These features are processed using a lightweight Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) model, which detects and classifies anomalies based on bias types, while
a recovery module restores damaged sensor data to ensure continuous system
operation. GRAD has a lightweight architecture consisting of two layers of GRU
with a limited number of neurons that make it appropriate for real-time
applications while maintaining high detection accuracy. The GRAD framework
achieved remarkable performance in anomaly detection and classification. The
model demonstrated an overall F1-score of 97.6% for abnormal data and 99.4% for
normal data, signifying its high accuracy in distinguishing between normal and
anomalous sensor data. Regarding the anomaly classification, GRAD successfully
categorized different anomaly types with high precision, enabling the recovery
module to accurately restore damaged sensor data. Relative to analogous
studies, GRAD surpasses current models by attaining a balance between elevated
detection accuracy and diminished computational expense. These results
demonstrate GRAD's potential as a reliable and efficient solution for real-time
anomaly detection in autonomous vehicle systems, guaranteeing safe vehicle
operation with minimal computational overhead.

Conclusion: 块对角LoRA在保持参数效率的同时，显著提升了多设备环境下的服务效率。

Abstract: When serving a single base LLM with several different LoRA adapters
simultaneously, the adapters cannot simply be merged with the base model's
weights as the adapter swapping would create overhead and requests using
different adapters could not be batched. Rather, the LoRA computations have to
be separated from the base LLM computations, and in a multi-device setup the
LoRA adapters can be sharded in a way that is well aligned with the base
model's tensor parallel execution, as proposed in S-LoRA. However, the S-LoRA
sharding strategy encounters some communication overhead, which may be small in
theory, but can be large in practice. In this paper, we propose to constrain
certain LoRA factors to be block-diagonal, which allows for an alternative way
of sharding LoRA adapters that does not require any additional communication
for the LoRA computations. We demonstrate in extensive experiments that our
block-diagonal LoRA approach is similarly parameter efficient as standard LoRA
(i.e., for a similar number of parameters it achieves similar downstream
performance) and that it leads to significant end-to-end speed-up over S-LoRA.
For example, when serving on eight A100 GPUs, we observe up to 1.79x (1.23x)
end-to-end speed-up with 0.87x (1.74x) the number of adapter parameters for
Llama-3.1-70B, and up to 1.63x (1.3x) end-to-end speed-up with 0.86x (1.73x)
the number of adapter parameters for Llama-3.1-8B.

Result: 实验表明，SSO-PGA在性能和稳定性上显著优于传统PGA及其他先进算法。

Conclusion: SSO-PGA结合了优化的可解释性和深度学习的强大能力，为非负逆问题提供了鲁棒且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Proximal gradient algorithms (PGA), while foundational for inverse problems
like image reconstruction, often yield unstable convergence and suboptimal
solutions by violating the critical non-negativity constraint. We identify the
gradient descent step as the root cause of this issue, which introduces
negative values and induces high sensitivity to hyperparameters. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel multiplicative update proximal gradient
algorithm (SSO-PGA) with convergence guarantees, which is designed for
robustness in non-negative inverse problems. Our key innovation lies in
superseding the gradient descent step with a learnable sigmoid-based operator,
which inherently enforces non-negativity and boundedness by transforming
traditional subtractive updates into multiplicative ones. This design,
augmented by a sliding parameter for enhanced stability and convergence, not
only improves robustness but also boosts expressive capacity and noise
immunity. We further formulate a degradation model for multi-modal restoration
and derive its SSO-PGA-based optimization algorithm, which is then unfolded
into a deep network to marry the interpretability of optimization with the
power of deep learning. Extensive numerical and real-world experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses traditional PGA and other
state-of-the-art algorithms, ensuring superior performance and stability.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful accelerator of

requiring additional data collection and retraining for each new property. Here
we introduce and validate GATE (Geometrically Aligned Transfer Encoder) -- a
generalizable AI framework that jointly learns 34 physicochemical properties
spanning thermal, electrical, mechanical, and optical domains. By aligning
these properties within a shared geometric space, GATE captures cross-property
correlations that reduce disjoint-property bias -- a key factor causing false
negatives in multi-criteria screening. To demonstrate its generalizability,
GATE -- without any problem-specific reconfiguration -- was directly applied to
the discovery of immersion cooling fluids for data centers, a stringent
real-world challenge defined by the Open Compute Project (OCP). Screening
billions of candidates, GATE identified 92,861 molecules as promising for
practical deployment. Four were experimentally or literarily validated, showing
strong agreement with wet-lab measurements and performance comparable to or

generators meeting formal correctness criteria. In \textit{Symbolic Neural
Generators} (SNGs), symbolic learners examine logical specifications of
feasible data from a small set of instances -- sometimes just one. Each
specification in turn constrains the conditional information supplied to a
neural-based generator, which rejects any instance violating the symbolic
specification. Like other neurosymbolic approaches, SNG exploits the
complementary strengths of symbolic and neural methods. The outcome of an SNG
is a triple $(H, X, W)$, where $H$ is a symbolic description of feasible
instances constructed from data, $X$ a set of generated new instances that
satisfy the description, and $W$ an associated weight. We introduce a semantics
for such systems, based on the construction of appropriate \textit{base} and
\textit{fibre} partially-ordered sets combined into an overall partial order,
and outline a probabilistic extension relevant to practical applications. In
this extension, SNGs result from searching over a weighted partial ordering. We
implement an SNG combining a restricted form of Inductive Logic Programming
(ILP) with a large language model (LLM) and evaluate it on early-stage drug
design. Our main interest is the description and the set of potential inhibitor
molecules generated by the SNG. On benchmark problems -- where drug targets are
well understood -- SNG performance is statistically comparable to
state-of-the-art methods. On exploratory problems with poorly understood
targets, generated molecules exhibit binding affinities on par with leading
clinical candidates. Experts further find the symbolic specifications useful as
preliminary filters, with several generated molecules identified as viable for
synthesis and wet-lab testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在单次生成问题中表现良好，但其微调过程可能损害模型的探索能力，导致生成多样性下降。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效优化max@k指标，使模型与Best-of-N推理策略对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了强化学习微调中的探索能力问题，提升了模型在多样化生成任务中的性能。

Abstract: The application of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to
mathematical and coding domains has demonstrated significant improvements in
the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of Large Language Models. Despite
its success in single generation problem solving, the reinforcement learning
fine-tuning process may harm the model's exploration ability, as reflected in
decreased diversity of generations and a resulting degradation of performance
during Best-of-N sampling for large N values. In this work, we focus on
optimizing the max@k metric, a continuous generalization of pass@k. We derive
an unbiased on-policy gradient estimate for direct optimization of this metric.
Furthermore, we extend our derivations to the off-policy updates, a common
element in modern RLVR algorithms, that allows better sample efficiency.
Empirically, we show that our objective effectively optimizes max@k metric in
off-policy scenarios, aligning the model with the Best-of-N inference strategy.

*Youngjun Choi,Joonseong Kang,Sungjun Lim,Kyungwoo Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EV框架通过特征值分析提升数据估值在OOD场景下的鲁棒性，无需额外训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据估值方法在OOD场景下表现不佳，且计算成本高。

Method: 提出Eigen-Value（EV）框架，利用ID数据的特征值近似域差异，并通过扰动理论估计数据点贡献。

Result: EV在真实数据集上提升了OOD鲁棒性，且计算高效。

Conclusion: EV为大规模域偏移场景提供了一种高效的数据估值解决方案。

Abstract: Data valuation has become central in the era of data-centric AI. It drives
efficient training pipelines and enables objective pricing in data markets by
assigning a numeric value to each data point. Most existing data valuation
methods estimate the effect of removing individual data points by evaluating
changes in model validation performance under in-distribution (ID) settings, as
opposed to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios where data follow different
patterns. Since ID and OOD data behave differently, data valuation methods
based on ID loss often fail to generalize to OOD settings, particularly when
the validation set contains no OOD data. Furthermore, although OOD-aware
methods exist, they involve heavy computational costs, which hinder practical
deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce \emph{Eigen-Value} (EV),
a plug-and-play data valuation framework for OOD robustness that uses only an
ID data subset, including during validation. EV provides a new spectral
approximation of domain discrepancy, which is the gap of loss between ID and
OOD using ratios of eigenvalues of ID data's covariance matrix. EV then
estimates the marginal contribution of each data point to this discrepancy via
perturbation theory, alleviating the computational burden. Subsequently, EV
plugs into ID loss-based methods by adding an EV term without any additional
training loop. We demonstrate that EV achieves improved OOD robustness and
stable value rankings across real-world datasets, while remaining
computationally lightweight. These results indicate that EV is practical for
large-scale settings with domain shift, offering an efficient path to
OOD-robust data valuation.

Abstract: We explore a "best-of-both" approach to modelling molecular properties by
combining learned molecular descriptors from a graph neural network (GNN) with
general-purpose descriptors and a mixed ensemble of machine learning (ML)

combining task-specific GNN-derived features with conventional molecular
descriptors.
  We demonstrate that our framework outperforms the cutting-edge ChemProp model
on all regression datasets tested and 6 of 9 classification datasets. We
further show that including the GNN features derived from ChemProp boosts the
ensemble model's performance on several datasets where it otherwise would have
underperformed. We conclude that to achieve optimal performance across a wide
set of problems, it is vital to combine general-purpose descriptors with
task-specific learned features and use a diverse set of ML models to make the
predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于真实数据集被噪声污染且不可观测，传统核心集评估方法难以直接应用，因此需要设计新的误差度量方法。

Method: 提出一种新的误差度量方法，并基于此设计核心集构建算法，证明其在噪声环境下能提供更紧的近似保证。

Result: 新方法在理论和实验中均优于传统方法，核心集大小可减少至多$\mathrm{poly}(k)$倍。

Conclusion: 新误差度量方法在噪声环境下显著提升核心集构建效率和质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of constructing coresets for $(k, z)$-clustering when
the input dataset is corrupted by stochastic noise drawn from a known
distribution. In this setting, evaluating the quality of a coreset is
inherently challenging, as the true underlying dataset is unobserved. To
address this, we investigate coreset construction using surrogate error metrics
that are tractable and provably related to the true clustering cost. We analyze
a traditional metric from prior work and introduce a new error metric that more
closely aligns with the true cost. Although our metric is defined independently
of the noise distribution, it enables approximation guarantees that scale with
the noise level. We design a coreset construction algorithm based on this
metric and show that, under mild assumptions on the data and noise, enforcing
an $\varepsilon$-bound under our metric yields smaller coresets and tighter
guarantees on the true clustering cost than those obtained via classical
metrics. In particular, we prove that the coreset size can improve by a factor
of up to $\mathrm{poly}(k)$, where $n$ is the dataset size. Experiments on
real-world datasets support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the
practical advantages of our approach.

Conclusion: SNN为概率预测提供了连贯且可处理的框架，从点估计提升到基于振幅的分布。

Abstract: We introduce the Schrodinger Neural Network (SNN), a principled architecture
for conditional density estimation and uncertainty quantification inspired by
quantum mechanics. The SNN maps each input to a normalized wave function on the
output domain and computes predictive probabilities via the Born rule. The SNN
departs from standard parametric likelihood heads by learning complex
coefficients of a spectral expansion (e . g ., Chebyshev polynomials) whose
squared modulus yields the conditional density $p(y|x)=\left| \psi _x(y)\right|
{}^2$ with analytic normalization. This representation confers three practical
advantages: positivity and exact normalization by construction, native
multimodality through interference among basis modes without explicit mixture
bookkeeping, and yields closed-form (or efficiently computable)
functionals$-$such as moments and several calibration diagnostics$-$as
quadratic forms in coefficient space. We develop the statistical and
computational foundations of the SNN, including (i) training by exact
maximum-likelihood with unit-sphere coefficient parameterization, (ii)
physics-inspired quadratic regularizers (kinetic and potential energies)
motivated by uncertainty relations between localization and spectral
complexity, (iii) scalable low-rank and separable extensions for multivariate
outputs, (iv) operator-based extensions that represent observables,
constraints, and weak labels as self-adjoint matrices acting on the amplitude
space, and (v) a comprehensive framework for evaluating multimodal predictions.
The SNN provides a coherent, tractable framework to elevate probabilistic
prediction from point estimates to physically inspired amplitude-based
distributions.

Motivation: 利用移动用户的地理信息，优化联邦学习模型，使其更好地适应不同地理区域的数据和行为。

Result: 在6个国家的心率预测数据上，SGFusion显著提升模型性能，且计算成本可控。

Conclusion: SGFusion通过地理信息融合和随机梯度共享，有效提升联邦学习模型的实用性和收敛性。

Abstract: This paper proposes Stochastic Geographic Gradient Fusion (SGFusion), a novel
training algorithm to leverage the geographic information of mobile users in
Federated Learning (FL). SGFusion maps the data collected by mobile devices
onto geographical zones and trains one FL model per zone, which adapts well to
the data and behaviors of users in that zone. SGFusion models the local
data-based correlation among geographical zones as a hierarchical random graph
(HRG) optimized by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. At each training step,
every zone fuses its local gradient with gradients derived from a small set of
other zones sampled from the HRG. This approach enables knowledge fusion and
sharing among geographical zones in a probabilistic and stochastic gradient
fusion process with self-attention weights, such that "more similar" zones have
"higher probabilities" of sharing gradients with "larger attention weights."
SGFusion remarkably improves model utility without introducing undue
computational cost. Extensive theoretical and empirical results using a
heart-rate prediction dataset collected across 6 countries show that models
trained with SGFusion converge with upper-bounded expected errors and
significantly improve utility in all countries compared to existing approaches
without notable cost in system scalability.

Conclusion: 理论分析和数值结果验证了在特定条件下，差分隐私可以作为信道噪声的额外优势实现。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed learning paradigm that preserves
privacy by eliminating the need to exchange raw data during training. In its
prototypical edge instantiation with underlying wireless transmissions enabled
by analog over-the-air computing (AirComp), referred to as \emph{over-the-air
FL (AirFL)}, the inherent channel noise plays a unique role of \emph{frenemy}
in the sense that it degrades training due to noisy global aggregation while
providing a natural source of randomness for privacy-preserving mechanisms,
formally quantified by \emph{differential privacy (DP)}. It remains,
nevertheless, challenging to effectively harness such channel impairments, as
prior arts, under assumptions of either simple channel models or restricted
types of loss functions, mostly considering (local) DP enhancement with a
single-round or non-convergent bound on privacy loss. In this paper, we study
AirFL over multiple-access fading channels with a multi-antenna base station
(BS) subject to user-level DP requirements. Despite a recent study, which
claimed in similar settings that artificial noise (AN) must be injected to
ensure DP in general, we demonstrate, on the contrary, that DP can be gained as
a \emph{perk} even \emph{without} employing any AN. Specifically, we derive a
novel bound on DP that converges under general bounded-domain assumptions on
model parameters, along with a convergence bound with general smooth and
non-convex loss functions. Next, we optimize over receive beamforming and power
allocations to characterize the optimal convergence-privacy trade-offs, which
also reveal explicit conditions in which DP is achievable without compromising
training. Finally, our theoretical findings are validated by extensive
numerical results.

Result: 在四个数据集上实验表明，ADPrompt在节点分类任务中优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: ADPrompt有效解决了预训练GNN的公平性问题，并在下游任务中表现优异。

Abstract: In recent years, pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) through
self-supervised learning on unlabeled graph data has emerged as a widely
adopted paradigm in graph learning. Although the paradigm is effective for
pre-training powerful GNN models, the objective gap often exists between
pre-training and downstream tasks. To bridge this gap, graph prompting adapts
pre-trained GNN models to specific downstream tasks with extra learnable
prompts while keeping the pre-trained GNN models frozen. As recent graph
prompting methods largely focus on enhancing model utility on downstream tasks,
they often overlook fairness concerns when designing prompts for adaptation. In
fact, pre-trained GNN models will produce discriminative node representations
across demographic subgroups, as downstream graph data inherently contains
biases in both node attributes and graph structures. To address this issue, we
propose an Adaptive Dual Prompting (ADPrompt) framework that enhances fairness
for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. To mitigate attribute
bias, we design an Adaptive Feature Rectification module that learns customized
attribute prompts to suppress sensitive information at the input layer,
reducing bias at the source. Afterward, we propose an Adaptive Message
Calibration module that generates structure prompts at each layer, which adjust
the message from neighboring nodes to enable dynamic and soft calibration of
the information flow. Finally, ADPrompt jointly optimizes the two prompting
modules to adapt the pre-trained GNN while enhancing fairness. We conduct
extensive experiments on four datasets with four pre-training strategies to
evaluate the performance of ADPrompt. The results demonstrate that our proposed
ADPrompt outperforms seven baseline methods on node classification tasks.

Abstract: Chip placement is a vital stage in modern chip design as it has a substantial
impact on the subsequent processes and the overall quality of the final chip.
The use of black-box optimization (BBO) for chip placement has a history of
several decades. However, early efforts were limited by immature problem
formulations and inefficient algorithm designs. Recent progress has shown the
effectiveness and efficiency of BBO for chip placement, proving its potential
to achieve state-of-the-art results. Despite these advancements, the field
lacks a unified, BBO-specific benchmark for thoroughly assessing various
problem formulations and BBO algorithms. To fill this gap, we propose
BBOPlace-Bench, the first benchmark designed specifically for evaluating and
developing BBO algorithms for chip placement tasks. It integrates three problem
formulations of BBO for chip placement, and offers a modular, decoupled, and
flexible framework that enables users to seamlessly implement, test, and
compare their own algorithms. BBOPlace-Bench integrates a wide variety of
existing BBO algorithms, including simulated annealing (SA), evolutionary
algorithms (EAs), and Bayesian optimization (BO). Experimental results show
that the problem formulations of mask-guided optimization and hyperparameter
optimization exhibit superior performance than the sequence pair problem
formulation, while EAs demonstrate better overall performance than SA and BO,
especially in high-dimensional search spaces, and also achieve state-of-the-art
performance compared to the mainstream chip placement methods. BBOPlace-Bench
not only facilitates the development of efficient BBO-driven solutions for chip
placement but also broadens the practical application scenarios (which are
urgently needed) for the BBO community. The code of BBOPlace-Bench is available
at https://github.com/lamda-bbo/BBOPlace-Bench.

Result: 实验验证了T-REGS在合成数据和经典SSL基准上的有效性。

Conclusion: T-REGS是一种简单有效的正则化方法，能显著提升自监督学习的表示质量。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for
learning representations without labeled data, often by enforcing invariance to
input transformations such as rotations or blurring. Recent studies have
highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding
dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional
subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this
work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on
the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation.
We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously
mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on
arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data
and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at
enhancing representation quality.

Conclusion: 该框架为神经ODE提供了一种高效且可靠的混合精度训练方案，并开源了PyTorch包rampde。

Abstract: Exploiting low-precision computations has become a standard strategy in deep
learning to address the growing computational costs imposed by ever larger
models and datasets. However, naively performing all computations in low
precision can lead to roundoff errors and instabilities. Therefore, mixed
precision training schemes usually store the weights in high precision and use
low-precision computations only for whitelisted operations. Despite their
success, these principles are currently not reliable for training
continuous-time architectures such as neural ordinary differential equations
(Neural ODEs). This paper presents a mixed precision training framework for
neural ODEs, combining explicit ODE solvers with a custom backpropagation
scheme, and demonstrates its effectiveness across a range of learning tasks.
Our scheme uses low-precision computations for evaluating the velocity,
parameterized by the neural network, and for storing intermediate states, while
stability is provided by a custom dynamic adjoint scaling and by accumulating
the solution and gradients in higher precision. These contributions address two
key challenges in training neural ODE: the computational cost of repeated
network evaluations and the growth of memory requirements with the number of
time steps or layers. Along with the paper, we publish our extendable,
open-source PyTorch package rampde, whose syntax resembles that of leading
packages to provide a drop-in replacement in existing codes. We demonstrate the
reliability and effectiveness of our scheme using challenging test cases and on
neural ODE applications in image classification and generative models,
achieving approximately 50% memory reduction and up to 2x speedup while
maintaining accuracy comparable to single-precision training.

Result: RGA KANs在多个PDE基准测试中表现优于cPIKANs和PirateNets，稳定性显著提升。

Conclusion: RGA KANs是解决深度cPIKANs训练不稳定问题的有效方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Since their introduction, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have been
successfully applied across several domains, with physics-informed machine
learning (PIML) emerging as one of the areas where they have thrived. In the
PIML setting, Chebyshev-based physics-informed KANs (cPIKANs) have become the
standard due to their computational efficiency. However, like their multilayer
perceptron-based counterparts, cPIKANs face significant challenges when scaled
to depth, leading to training instabilities that limit their applicability to
several PDE problems. To address this, we propose a basis-agnostic, Glorot-like
initialization scheme that preserves activation variance and yields substantial
improvements in stability and accuracy over the default initialization of
cPIKANs. Inspired by the PirateNet architecture, we further introduce
Residual-Gated Adaptive KANs (RGA KANs), designed to mitigate divergence in
deep cPIKANs where initialization alone is not sufficient. Through empirical
tests and information bottleneck analysis, we show that RGA KANs successfully
traverse all training phases, unlike baseline cPIKANs, which stagnate in the
diffusion phase in specific PDE settings. Evaluations on seven standard forward
PDE benchmarks under a fixed training pipeline with adaptive components
demonstrate that RGA KANs consistently outperform parameter-matched cPIKANs and
PirateNets - often by several orders of magnitude - while remaining stable in
settings where the others diverge.

Result: 在合成和真实网络中，DFNMF在保持模块性的同时显著提高了组平衡性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DFNMF是一种高效、可扩展且透明的公平图聚类方法。

Abstract: Fair graph clustering seeks partitions that respect network structure while
maintaining proportional representation across sensitive groups, with
applications spanning community detection, team formation, resource allocation,
and social network analysis. Many existing approaches enforce rigid constraints
or rely on multi-stage pipelines (e.g., spectral embedding followed by
$k$-means), limiting trade-off control, interpretability, and scalability. We
introduce \emph{DFNMF}, an end-to-end deep nonnegative tri-factorization
tailored to graphs that directly optimizes cluster assignments with a soft
statistical-parity regularizer. A single parameter $\lambda$ tunes the
fairness--utility balance, while nonnegativity yields parts-based factors and
transparent soft memberships. The optimization uses sparse-friendly alternating
updates and scales near-linearly with the number of edges. Across synthetic and
real networks, DFNMF achieves substantially higher group balance at comparable
modularity, often dominating state-of-the-art baselines on the Pareto front.

TL;DR: Seq-MADAC框架通过考虑参数间的依赖关系，改进了动态算法配置的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法未考虑复杂算法中参数间的固有依赖关系，导致结果次优。

Method: 提出Seq-MADAC框架，利用顺序优势分解网络捕捉参数依赖。

Result: 实验表明Seq-MADAC优于现有MARL方法，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: Seq-MADAC为依赖感知的自动算法配置提供了新范式。

Abstract: Dynamic algorithm configuration (DAC) is a recent trend in automated machine
learning, which can dynamically adjust the algorithm's configuration during the
execution process and relieve users from tedious trial-and-error tuning tasks.
Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches have improved
the configuration of multiple heterogeneous hyperparameters, making various
parameter configurations for complex algorithms possible. However, many complex
algorithms have inherent inter-dependencies among multiple parameters (e.g.,
determining the operator type first and then the operator's parameter), which
are, however, not considered in previous approaches, thus leading to
sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose the sequential multi-agent DAC
(Seq-MADAC) framework to address this issue by considering the inherent
inter-dependencies of multiple parameters. Specifically, we propose a
sequential advantage decomposition network, which can leverage action-order
information through sequential advantage decomposition. Experiments from
synthetic functions to the configuration of multi-objective optimization
algorithms demonstrate Seq-MADAC's superior performance over state-of-the-art
MARL methods and show strong generalization across problem classes. Seq-MADAC
establishes a new paradigm for the widespread dependency-aware automated
algorithm configuration. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的多语言翻译流程，结合U-Net文本检测、Tesseract文本识别和自定义Seq2Seq Transformer模型，验证了从图像直接翻译文本的可行性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决依赖预训练模型的局限性，强调完全定制化和适应性，实现从图像中直接翻译文本。

Method: 使用U-Net检测图像文本区域，Tesseract提取文本，自定义Transformer进行多语言翻译。

Result: 在文本检测、识别和翻译性能（BLEU分数）上表现出色。

Conclusion: 验证了定制化系统在图像文本翻译中的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end multilingual translation pipeline that
integrates a custom U-Net for text detection, the Tesseract engine for text
recognition, and a from-scratch sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) Transformer for
Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Our approach first utilizes a U-Net model,
trained on a synthetic dataset , to accurately segment and detect text regions
from an image. These detected regions are then processed by Tesseract to
extract the source text. This extracted text is fed into a custom Transformer
model trained from scratch on a multilingual parallel corpus spanning 5
languages. Unlike systems reliant on monolithic pre-trained models, our
architecture emphasizes full customization and adaptability. The system is
evaluated on its text detection accuracy, text recognition quality, and
translation performance via BLEU scores. The complete pipeline demonstrates
promising results, validating the viability of a custom-built system for
translating text directly from images.

TL;DR: TAMI框架通过LTE和LHA组件解决时序图中异构性问题，提升链接预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时序图中交互的异构性导致现有方法在编码时序信息和处理间歇性交互时效果不佳。

Method: 提出TAMI框架，包含LTE（对数时间编码）和LHA（链接历史聚合）组件。

Result: 在13个经典数据集和3个TGB数据集上，TAMI显著提升了链接预测性能。

Conclusion: TAMI能有效解决时序图中的异构性问题，并可无缝集成到现有模型中。

Abstract: Temporal graph link prediction aims to predict future interactions between
nodes in a graph based on their historical interactions, which are encoded in
node embeddings. We observe that heterogeneity naturally appears in temporal
interactions, e.g., a few node pairs can make most interaction events, and
interaction events happen at varying intervals. This leads to the problems of
ineffective temporal information encoding and forgetting of past interactions
for a pair of nodes that interact intermittently for their link prediction.
Existing methods, however, do not consider such heterogeneity in their learning
process, and thus their learned temporal node embeddings are less effective,
especially when predicting the links for infrequently interacting node pairs.
To cope with the heterogeneity, we propose a novel framework called TAMI, which
contains two effective components, namely log time encoding function (LTE) and
link history aggregation (LHA). LTE better encodes the temporal information
through transforming interaction intervals into more balanced ones, and LHA
prevents the historical interactions for each target node pair from being
forgotten. State-of-the-art temporal graph neural networks can be seamlessly
and readily integrated into TAMI to improve their effectiveness. Experiment
results on 13 classic datasets and three newest temporal graph benchmark (TGB)
datasets show that TAMI consistently improves the link prediction performance
of the underlying models in both transductive and inductive settings. Our code
is available at https://github.com/Alleinx/TAMI_temporal_graph.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决DPO对数据噪声敏感和过拟合的问题，同时避免现有DRO方法的保守性和高计算成本。

Method: 提出DPO-PRO，通过轻量级DRO公式专注于偏好不确定性，避免不必要的保守性。

Result: 在标准对齐基准和实际公共卫生任务中，DPO-PRO显著提升对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种高效且鲁棒的DPO改进方法，适用于噪声环境下的模型微调。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a popular method for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) due to its stability and simplicity.
However, it is also known to be sensitive to noise in the data and prone to
overfitting. Recent works have proposed using distributionally robust
optimization (DRO) to address potential noise and distributional shift in the
data. However, these methods often suffer from excessive conservatism and high
computational cost. We propose DPO-PRO (DPO with Preference Robustness), a
robust fine-tuning algorithm based on DPO which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution through a lightweight DRO formulation. Unlike prior
DRO-based variants, DPO-PRO focuses solely on uncertainty in preferences,
avoiding unnecessary conservatism and incurring negligible computational
overhead. We further show that DPO-PRO is equivalent to a regularized DPO
objective that penalizes model overconfidence under weak preference signals. We
evaluate DPO-PRO on standard alignment benchmarks and a real-world public
health task. Experimental results show that our method consistently improves
robustness to noisy preference signals compared to existing DPO variants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准掩码扩散模型无法有效捕捉并发预测令牌间的依赖关系，导致生成质量下降。

Result: 在合成数据集、数独和文本数据上，VMD成功学习到依赖关系，提升生成质量和全局一致性。

Conclusion: VMD通过整合变分推理显著提升了掩码扩散模型的依赖建模能力，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Masked diffusion models have recently emerged as a flexible framework for
discrete generative modeling. However, a key limitation of standard masked
diffusion is its inability to effectively capture dependencies among tokens
that are predicted concurrently, leading to degraded generation quality when
dependencies among tokens are important. To explicitly model dependencies among
tokens, we propose Variational Masked Diffusion (VMD), a framework that
introduces latent variables into the masked diffusion process. Through
controlled experiments on synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that VMD
successfully learns dependencies that conventional masked diffusion fails to
capture. We further validate the effectiveness of our approach on Sudoku
puzzles and text datasets, where learning of dependencies among tokens improves
global consistency. Across these domains, VMD enhances both generation quality
and dependency awareness, highlighting the value of integrating variational
inference into masked diffusion. Our code is available at:
