### [1] [Explainable Detection of AI-Generated Images with Artifact Localization Using Faster-Than-Lies and Vision-Language Models for Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23775)
*Aryan Mathur,Asaduddin Ahmed,Pushti Amit Vasoya,Simeon Kandan Sonar,Yasir Z,Madesh Kuppusamy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合轻量级卷积分类器和视觉语言模型的可解释图像真实性检测系统，用于分类、定位和解释低分辨率图像中的伪影。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成图像的逼真度增加，验证视觉真实性面临挑战。

Method: 结合Faster-Than-Lies卷积分类器和Qwen2-VL-7B视觉语言模型，利用自编码器重建误差图生成伪影定位热图。

Result: 在扩展的CiFAKE数据集上达到96.5%准确率，推理时间175ms，支持本地或边缘设备部署。

Conclusion: 展示了视觉与语言推理结合在低分辨率图像真实性检测中的可行性，并展望了跨领域应用潜力。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [2] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer是一种基于Transformer的框架，通过识别重复和结构一致性实现类无关对象计数，性能接近当前最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能轻松计数多样对象，但现有模型在复杂形状或重叠对象时容易出错。

Method: 结合DINOv2自监督基础模型和位置嵌入融合，通过轻量卷积解码器生成密度图。

Result: 在FSC-147数据集上表现优异，尤其在结构复杂或密集场景中更准确。

Conclusion: 基础模型（如DINOv2）的整合使计数系统接近人类结构感知能力，推动通用无示例计数范式。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [3] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用固定摄像头和深度学习监测河流漂浮垃圾的新方法，重点解决了数据泄漏和几何模型问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流中漂浮的人为垃圾对环境和人类活动造成严重影响，亟需有效的监测方法。

Method: 使用固定摄像头和深度学习模型进行连续监测，结合几何模型估计物体实际大小。

Result: 验证了数据集构建协议的重要性，并展示了结合几何模型和回归修正的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本、自动化的城市水域监测系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [4] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow是一种物理感知的超分辨率框架，针对遥感图像在分布外条件下的鲁棒性设计，通过双条件架构和多方面损失函数确保物理准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决遥感图像超分辨率在分布外条件下（如罕见地貌特征）产生的视觉合理但物理不准确的问题。

Method: 采用双条件架构（Gated ControlNet和文本提示）和多方面损失函数，结合随机前向传播量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在盲评中，专家认为其输出接近真实图像，显著优于现有方法，FID降低近40%。

Conclusion: RareFlow为数据稀缺科学领域提供了高保真合成框架，并为严重域偏移下的可控生成提供了新范例。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [5] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的3D场景生成方法，利用通用文本到3D对象扩散模型作为模块化生成器，通过多块去噪和加权平均实现大规模场景合成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多局限于单对象生成、需领域特定训练或缺乏360度视角支持，限制了应用范围。

Method: 将场景生成重新定义为多块去噪问题，独立生成重叠3D区域并通过加权平均无缝融合。

Result: 支持多样化场景布局、高效生成和灵活编辑，保留了局部语义控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为通用语言驱动的3D场景构建提供了简单而强大的基础。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [6] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LHT-CLIP是一种无需训练的框架，通过分层、多头和令牌级别的视觉判别性提升CLIP模型的语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP模型的图像级预训练目标与像素级视觉理解需求不匹配，导致语义分割性能不佳。

Method: 提出语义空间重加权、选择性头增强和异常令牌替换三种技术。

Result: 在8个语义分割基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: LHT-CLIP高效且实用，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [7] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride是一种无需手动场景分割即可生成连贯场景级字幕的管道，通过自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术提升字幕质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有字幕可能因缺乏结构和连贯性而影响教育视频的学习效果，DynaStride旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用自适应帧采样、多模态窗口技术和动态步长窗口选择算法，结合多模态链式思维生成字幕。

Result: 在N-gram和语义相似度指标上优于基线模型，生成的字幕更连贯且信息丰富。

Conclusion: DynaStride为AI生成教学内容提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [8] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D是一种低延迟的人像新视角合成方法，通过结合图像扩散模型提升现有图像到3D方法的输出质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人像生成图像到3D模型存在视觉伪影、细节不足和身份保留不完整的问题，而图像扩散模型虽能生成高质量图像，但缺乏3D一致性且计算成本高。

Method: 结合前馈图像到3D生成管道和单步扩散模型，通过合成多视图数据预训练和高质量真实图像微调，实现多视图一致的渲染优化。

Result: 在质量和效率上均优于当前最先进的人像新视角合成方法。

Conclusion: TurboPortrait3D通过扩散模型显著提升了3D人像生成的质量和一致性，同时保持低延迟。

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [9] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS是一种基于3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的框架，专为室内场景重建设计，通过引入语言提示平面先验（LP3）和几何先验监督，显著提升了低纹理区域的3D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低纹理和大区域的室内场景中，传统3DGS的光度损失会导致几何模糊和低保真3D表面重建。

Method: 提出LP3流程，利用预训练视觉语言分割模型生成区域建议，并通过跨视图融合和几何先验优化3D高斯分布，加入平面先验和几何先验监督项。

Result: 在标准室内基准测试中，PlanarGS显著优于现有方法，重建出更准确和详细的3D表面。

Conclusion: PlanarGS通过结合语言提示和几何先验，有效解决了3DGS在室内场景中的局限性，实现了高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [10] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe是一种自适应训练方案，通过神经元剪枝和输入频率密集化优化隐式神经表示（INR）架构，减少冗余并提升表示能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决隐式神经表示中频率选择和架构冗余的挑战，避免启发式方法和繁重的超参数优化。

Method: 采用神经元剪枝机制和输入频率密集化，动态调整网络架构。

Result: 在图像和SDF实验中，AIRe减小模型规模的同时保持或提升重建质量。

Conclusion: AIRe提供了一种高效的INR优化方案，平衡网络规模与重建质量。

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [11] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Neural USD的框架，用于解决生成模型中精确和迭代对象编辑的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成模型在对象编辑时容易导致全局变化，缺乏精确控制。

Method: 借鉴计算机图形学中的USD标准，采用结构化、层次化的场景表示，并结合微调方法解耦控制信号。

Result: Neural USD框架实现了对对象外观、几何和姿态的独立控制，支持迭代和增量工作流。

Conclusion: Neural USD为生成模型中的精确对象编辑提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision是一种新型图像护栏，通过结合人类推理提升适应性和透明度，无需重新训练即可动态适应新威胁，并在性能上优于GPT-4o。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像护栏模型因缺乏语义推理和适应新威胁的能力而受限，SafeVision旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用数据收集与生成框架、策略遵循训练流程和定制损失函数，结合多样化QA生成策略。

Result: 在VisionHarm-T和VisionHarm-C数据集上分别比GPT-4o提升8.6%和15.5%，速度提升16倍以上。

Conclusion: SafeVision提供了一种全面、可解释且动态适应新威胁的图像护栏解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合链式思维（CoT）推理的框架，用于胸部X光片分析，旨在提高模型的透明度和临床可审计性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像分析中缺乏透明推理过程，无法满足临床需求。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方法：基于推理风格的监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），结合可验证的奖励机制。

Result: 模型在分布外评估中表现优异，同时提高了可解释性；专家研究表明，完整推理轨迹增强了信心并减少了报告时间。

Conclusion: 该框架为胸部X光片等医学影像任务提供了可信赖且可解释的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

Abstract: Cost-and-Quality (CQ) controllability in arbitrary-scale super-resolution is

TL;DR: TeleEgo是一个多模态、长时记忆的基准测试，用于评估现实场景中的自我中心AI助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估能力，缺乏真实流式场景或仅支持短期任务。

Method: TeleEgo包含14小时/参与者的同步多模态数据，涵盖四个领域，定义了12个子任务。

Result: 包含3,291个人工验证的QA项，提出两个关键指标评估实时性和长时记忆。

Conclusion: TeleEgo为实用AI助手的发展提供了全面且真实的评估。

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习模型在糖尿病视网膜病变检测中因设备、人口统计和成像条件差异导致的分布变化问题。

Result: 在多数据集上验证了方法的有效性，尤其在未见过的外部数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: AdvBlur方法显著提升了糖尿病视网膜病变分类的鲁棒性，适用于不同分布的数据集。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a

Motivation: 火星科学领域缺乏标准化的基准和评估框架，限制了基础模型的发展。Mars-Bench旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 引入Mars-Bench基准，包含20个数据集，涵盖地质特征分类、分割和检测任务，并提供标准化数据集和基线评估。

Result: 分析表明，火星专用基础模型可能优于通用模型，支持领域适应性预训练的进一步探索。

Conclusion: Mars-Bench为火星科学领域的机器学习模型开发和比较提供了标准化基础，数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I模型红队测试方法依赖白盒访问且生成无意义提示，易被过滤。

Method: 交替优化微调管道，结合双规避策略（困惑度评分和禁用词惩罚）。

Result: 实验显示APT生成的可读对抗提示高效且具有优秀零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: APT成功暴露商业API关键漏洞，为模型安全提供新思路。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Conclusion: ResNet能有效训练深层网络，性能更优且收敛更快。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) has revolutionized computer vision, but
training very deep networks has been challenging due to the vanishing gradient
problem. This paper explores Residual Networks (ResNet), introduced by He et
al. (2015), which overcomes this limitation by using skip connections. ResNet
enables the training of networks with hundreds of layers by allowing gradients
to flow directly through shortcut connections that bypass intermediate layers.
In our implementation on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ResNet-18 achieves 89.9%
accuracy compared to 84.1% for a traditional deep CNN of similar depth, while
also converging faster and training more stably.

Motivation: 现有稀疏调优方法存在两阶段范式的问题：定位任务相关权重时忽略参数调整，且内存使用高。

Method: SNELLA采用低秩矩阵和非线性核函数减少内存，通过自适应双层稀疏分配机制定位权重。

Result: 在FGVC基准上Top-1准确率提升1.8%，内存减少31.1%-39.9%。

Conclusion: SNELLA在性能和内存效率上均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

TL;DR: COLA是一种基于最优传输的框架，通过恢复特征空间中的全局图像-文本对齐和局部结构一致性，解决CLIP模型在对抗扰动下的特征不对齐问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注对抗微调或提示优化，忽略了CLIP编码特征中的不对齐问题，导致对抗扰动下分类性能显著下降。

Method: COLA通过将对抗图像嵌入投影到类文本特征张成的子空间，并利用最优传输优化多视图增强下的图像-文本对齐。

Result: 在14个零样本分类基准测试中，COLA显著提升了对抗攻击下的性能（如ImageNet上平均提升6.7%），同时保持干净样本的高准确率。

Conclusion: COLA是一种无需训练且兼容现有微调模型的有效方法，显著提升了CLIP在对抗条件下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决T2I模型在生成合成训练数据时可能导致的过拟合和多样性降低问题。

Method: 提取类无关属性（如背景和姿态），在微调时显式条件化，生成时边缘化这些属性。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上表现优异，18/24实验设置中优于现有方法，部分准确率提升2%以上。

Conclusion: BOB能有效提升低样本细粒度分类任务的性能，合成数据增强效果显著。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

Result: 发现可解释性与分类性正相关，且通过优化可解释性可进一步提升分类性。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉模型的表示可解释性与分类性可统一优化，为实际应用提供支持。

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识蒸馏方法主要针对同构模型，在异构场景下表现不佳，尤其是涉及中间特征时。

Method: 通过傅里叶变换捕获全局特征，结合特征转换和对齐模块，实现异构教师-学生模型的知识传递。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K上分别取得5.59%和0.83%的性能提升。

Conclusion: UHKD是一种有效统一异构表示并高效利用视觉知识的方法。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

comprises 1.2k motion sequences collected from 10 unique dogs, offering rich
variation in both motion and breed. It addresses key limitations of existing
dog motion datasets, including the lack of multi-view and real 3D data, as well

we further introduce a three-stage, instance-specific optimization pipeline

Motivation: 扩散模型采样成本高，现有方法忽略去噪趋势和误差控制，导致轨迹偏差和结果不一致。

Method: ETC引入趋势预测器和误差容忍搜索机制，稳定加速采样过程。

Result: 实验显示ETC比FLUX加速2.65倍，一致性损失极小（-0.074 SSIM）。

Conclusion: ETC有效解决了扩散模型采样效率与质量平衡的问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,

training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation highlight the critical role
of high-quality video-text pairs in training models capable of producing
coherent and instruction-aligned videos. However, strategies for optimizing
video captions specifically for T2V training remain underexplored. In this
paper, we introduce VC4VG (Video Captioning for Video Generation), a
comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V
models.We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective,
decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all
benchmark tools and code at https://github.com/qyr0403/VC4VG to support further

TL;DR: MSRANetV2是一种基于ResNet50V2的卷积神经网络，通过残差注意力机制和SE块优化，用于结直肠癌组织图像分类，表现出色且可解释性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结直肠癌诊断方法存在主观性和耗时问题，深度学习可提高诊断精度和效率。

Method: 提出MSRANetV2模型，结合残差注意力机制和SE块，融合多尺度特征，并在公开数据集上验证。

Result: 在7K和100K数据集上，模型表现优异，各项指标接近1，Grad-CAM增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: MSRANetV2是一种可靠、高性能且可解释的结直肠癌组织分类模型。

Abstract: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading worldwide cause of cancer-related
mortality, and the role of prompt precise detection is of paramount interest in
improving patient outcomes. Conventional diagnostic methods such as colonoscopy
and histological examination routinely exhibit subjectivity, are extremely
time-consuming, and are susceptible to variation. Through the development of
digital pathology, deep learning algorithms have become a powerful approach in
enhancing diagnostic precision and efficiency. In our work, we proposed a
convolutional neural network architecture named MSRANetV2, specially optimized
for the classification of colorectal tissue images. The model employs a
ResNet50V2 backbone, extended with residual attention mechanisms and
squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks, to extract deep semantic and fine-grained
spatial features. With channel alignment and upsampling operations, MSRANetV2
effectively fuses multi-scale representations, thereby enhancing the robustness
of the classification. We evaluated our model on a five-fold stratified
cross-validation strategy on two publicly available datasets: CRC-VAL-HE-7K and
NCT-CRC-HE-100K. The proposed model achieved remarkable average Precision,
recall, F1-score, AUC, and test accuracy were 0.9884 plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900
plus-minus 0.0151, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0145, 0.9999 plus-minus 0.00006, and
0.9905 plus-minus 0.0025 on the 7K dataset. On the 100K dataset, they were
0.9904 plus-minus 0.0091, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071, 0.9900 plus-minus 0.0071,
0.9997 plus-minus 0.00016, and 0.9902 plus-minus 0.0006. Additionally, Grad-CAM
visualizations were incorporated to enhance model interpretability by
highlighting tissue areas that are medically relevant. These findings validate
that MSRANetV2 is a reliable, interpretable, and high-performing architectural
model for classifying CRC tissues.

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on
safety-critical autonomous driving tasks. Code and prompt are available at

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，UAP-SAM2显著优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2是首个针对SAM2的跨提示通用对抗攻击方法，有效解决了其架构差异带来的挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical

Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉生成中因逐令牌生成速度慢而受限，MC-SJD旨在解决这一问题。

Method: MC-SJD基于耦合理论，通过最大化连续迭代中采样相同草稿令牌的概率，提升SJD的接受率。

Result: MC-SJD在图像和视频生成中分别实现约4.2倍和13.3倍的加速，且输出质量无损。

Conclusion: MC-SJD通过简单修改显著提升自回归生成的效率，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖推理时干预，导致分布偏移和视觉质量下降。

Method: 设计条件扩散模型，结合身份掩码学习和正交身份映射策略。

Result: 在视觉质量、身份抑制和效用保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ID²Face提供了一种高效且可控的匿名化解决方案。

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Abstract: Microsaccades are small, involuntary eye movements vital for visual
perception and neural processing. Traditional microsaccade studies typically
use eye trackers or frame-based analysis, which, while precise, are costly and
limited in scalability and temporal resolution. Event-based sensing offers a
high-speed, low-latency alternative by capturing fine-grained spatiotemporal
changes efficiently. This work introduces a pioneering event-based microsaccade
dataset to support research on small eye movement dynamics in cognitive
computing. Using Blender, we render high-fidelity eye movement scenarios and
simulate microsaccades with angular displacements from 0.5 to 2.0 degrees,
divided into seven distinct classes. These are converted to event streams using
v2e, preserving the natural temporal dynamics of microsaccades, with durations
ranging from 0.25 ms to 2.25 ms. We evaluate the dataset using Spiking-VGG11,
Spiking-VGG13, and Spiking-VGG16, and propose Spiking-VGG16Flow, an
optical-flow-enhanced variant implemented in SpikingJelly. The models achieve
around 90 percent average accuracy, successfully classifying microsaccades by
angular displacement, independent of event count or duration. These results
demonstrate the potential of spiking neural networks for fine motion
recognition and establish a benchmark for event-based vision research. The
dataset, code, and trained models will be publicly available at

Result: 实验表明LR-YOLO在雾霾和低光条件下显著提升检测稳定性、优化平滑性和整体精度。

Conclusion: LROD框架有效解决了恢复与检测网络的功能不匹配问题，为复杂环境下的目标检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: To improve detection robustness in adverse conditions (e.g., haze and low
light), image restoration is commonly applied as a pre-processing step to
enhance image quality for the detector. However, the functional mismatch
between restoration and detection networks can introduce instability and hinder
effective integration -- an issue that remains underexplored. We revisit this
limitation through the lens of Lipschitz continuity, analyzing the functional
differences between restoration and detection networks in both the input space
and the parameter space. Our analysis shows that restoration networks perform
smooth, continuous transformations, while object detectors operate with
discontinuous decision boundaries, making them highly sensitive to minor
perturbations. This mismatch introduces instability in traditional cascade
frameworks, where even imperceptible noise from restoration is amplified during
detection, disrupting gradient flow and hindering optimization. To address
this, we propose Lipschitz-regularized object detection (LROD), a simple yet
effective framework that integrates image restoration directly into the
detector's feature learning, harmonizing the Lipschitz continuity of both tasks
during training. We implement this framework as Lipschitz-regularized YOLO
(LR-YOLO), extending seamlessly to existing YOLO detectors. Extensive
experiments on haze and low-light benchmarks demonstrate that LR-YOLO
consistently improves detection stability, optimization smoothness, and overall
accuracy.

identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.
Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method

Conclusion: UtilGen通过从视觉特性为中心转向任务效用为中心的数据增强范式，生成了更具影响力和任务相关性的合成数据。

Abstract: Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing
augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes
-- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality
synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is
essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as
training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and
network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a
novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the
data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data
via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight
allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic
sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data
generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the
synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative
model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts
generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each
generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying
complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves
superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over
previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that
UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating
the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to
task utility-centric data augmentation.

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

TL;DR: ViPER是一种自举框架，通过两阶段强化学习策略提升视觉语言模型的细粒度视觉感知能力，Qwen-Viper系列在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在细粒度视觉感知上的瓶颈，现有方法（如SFT和RFT）存在局限性。

Method: 提出两阶段任务，结合图像级和实例级重建，通过自批判和自预测实现迭代进化。

Result: Qwen-Viper系列在多个任务中平均提升1.7%，细粒度感知任务提升高达6.0%。

Conclusion: ViPER不仅提升感知能力，还揭示了生成与理解的互惠关系，为开发更自主的视觉语言模型提供了突破。

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感场景分类性能受限于标注数据稀缺和跨领域标注成本高，而现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）直接应用效果不佳。

Method: 系统评估了多种提示学习方法，包括上下文优化、条件上下文优化、多模态提示学习和自约束提示学习。

Result: 提示学习方法在少样本场景中优于零样本CLIP和线性探针基准，其中自约束提示学习表现最稳健。

Conclusion: 提示学习是解决遥感图像领域差距的高效方案，为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Conclusion: 该框架在有限监督下显著提高了分割准确性。

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, demonstrating strong performance
across various tasks. However, the learning effects are still limited by the
strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher
and student networks. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a novel
switching Dual-Student architecture that strategically selects the most
reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image
segmentation datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy
under limited supervision.

TL;DR: W2-Net通过双查询机制和子类可分匹配策略，显著提升了Referring Expression Counting任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在标注时通常关注类级别的特征，而忽略了属性信息，导致子类级别的计数不准确。

Method: 提出W2-Net框架，通过what-to-count和where-to-see双查询机制，以及Subclass Separable Matching策略，分离对象定位和属性特征提取。

Result: 在REC-8K数据集上，计数误差减少22.5%（验证集）和18.0%（测试集），定位F1分别提升7%和8%。

Conclusion: W2-Net通过显式分离对象定位和属性特征提取，有效提升了子类级别的计数和定位性能。

Abstract: Referring Expression Counting (REC) extends class-level object counting to
the fine-grained subclass-level, aiming to enumerate objects matching a textual
expression that specifies both the class and distinguishing attribute. A
fundamental challenge, however, has been overlooked: annotation points are
typically placed on class-representative locations (e.g., heads), forcing
models to focus on class-level features while neglecting attribute information
from other visual regions (e.g., legs for "walking"). To address this, we
propose W2-Net, a novel framework that explicitly decouples the problem into
"what to count" and "where to see" via a dual-query mechanism. Specifically,
alongside the standard what-to-count (w2c) queries that localize the object, we
introduce dedicated where-to-see (w2s) queries. The w2s queries are guided to
seek and extract features from attribute-specific visual regions, enabling
precise subclass discrimination. Furthermore, we introduce Subclass Separable
Matching (SSM), a novel matching strategy that incorporates a repulsive force
to enhance inter-subclass separability during label assignment. W2-Net
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art on the REC-8K dataset, reducing
counting error by 22.5% (validation) and 18.0% (test), and improving
localization F1 by 7% and 8%, respectively. Code will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度学习框架（如nnU-Net）因依赖复杂和设计单一而难以临床部署的问题。

Method: 通过解耦预处理、推理和后处理，使用Anima工具箱和ONNX Runtime优化模型大小和性能。

Result: 在300名亚急性和慢性卒中患者数据上，分割性能与原始PyTorch流程几乎相同（Dice差异<10^-3）。

Conclusion: StrokeSeg证明了高性能研究流程可以转化为便携、临床可用的工具。

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 偏振图像融合在伪装识别、组织病理分析等领域有重要应用，但现有方法在复杂亮度环境下难以有效整合互补信息。

Method: 设计了多尺度空间权重矩阵和亮度增强模块，结合全局-局部特征融合机制，实现非线性亮度校正。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MLSN在主观和客观评估中均优于现有方法，MS-SSIM和SD指标显著提升。

Conclusion: MLSN有效解决了偏振图像融合中的亮度适应问题，并提供了高质量数据集MSP，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Polarization image fusion combines S0 and DOLP images to reveal surface
roughness and material properties through complementary texture features, which
has important applications in camouflage recognition, tissue pathology
analysis, surface defect detection and other fields. To intergrate
coL-Splementary information from different polarized images in complex
luminance environment, we propose a luminance-aware multi-scale network (MLSN).
In the encoder stage, we propose a multi-scale spatial weight matrix through a
brightness-branch , which dynamically weighted inject the luminance into the
feature maps, solving the problem of inherent contrast difference in polarized
images. The global-local feature fusion mechanism is designed at the bottleneck
layer to perform windowed self-attention computation, to balance the global
context and local details through residual linking in the feature dimension
restructuring stage. In the decoder stage, to further improve the adaptability
to complex lighting, we propose a Brightness-Enhancement module, establishing
the mapping relationship between luminance distribution and texture features,
realizing the nonlinear luminance correction of the fusion result. We also
present MSP, an 1000 pairs of polarized images that covers 17 types of indoor
and outdoor complex lighting scenes. MSP provides four-direction polarization
raw maps, solving the scarcity of high-quality datasets in polarization image
fusion. Extensive experiment on MSP, PIF and GAND datasets verify that the
proposed MLSN outperms the state-of-the-art methods in subjective and objective
evaluations, and the MS-SSIM and SD metircs are higher than the average values
of other methods by 8.57%, 60.64%, 10.26%, 63.53%, 22.21%, and 54.31%,
respectively. The source code and dataset is avalable at

Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖放射学报告作为输入，但忽略了标签与文本弱关联的任务，本研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 系统研究了在预训练和微调阶段使用放射学报告的效果，涵盖诊断和预后任务，并考虑了不同训练集大小。

Result: 预训练对标签与文本强关联的任务有益，但对弱关联任务可能有害；微调阶段使用报告在某些情况下效果显著。

Conclusion: 研究提供了如何利用特权文本数据训练医学图像分类器的实用建议，并指出了当前研究的不足。

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

Motivation: 中风后MRI显示的结构变化是恢复和预后的生物标志物，但现有监督分割方法难以捕捉这些异常。

Method: 使用基于流的生成模型REFLECT，通过双专家标注的ATLAS数据评估模型性能，比较不同训练数据（中风患者和健康对照）的效果。

Result: 在健康对照数据上训练的模型表现更好，局灶性异常分割（Dice=0.37）和非局灶性异常检测（FROC=0.62）均优于中风患者数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 训练数据选择对模型性能至关重要，健康解剖数据能更好地建模正常变异，从而提高异常检测的可靠性。

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Motivation: 解决Qaraaoun水库因传感器故障和维护能力不足导致的水量监测不可靠问题。

Method: 结合Sentinel-2和Landsat影像，使用新提出的水体分割指数和SVR模型，仅通过卫星影像提取水面面积估算水量。

Result: 水体分割准确率超95%，SVR模型误差低于1.5%，决定系数超0.98。

Conclusion: 该方法成本低、鲁棒性强，适用于其他水体监测，并提供50年时间序列数据用于气候变化研究。

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

Conclusion: 该研究为推进透明、可信的语义分割模型提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前学习型图像压缩方法难以建模自然图像中复杂的相关性结构，尤其是全局结构与局部纹理的纠缠，导致低比特率下几何变形严重。

Method: 提出DCIC-sgp框架，首先生成自编码先验捕捉图像结构主干，并利用该先验整体调制压缩流程，特别是分析变换，以专注于高熵细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了低比特率下的几何变形，并在Kodak、CLIC和Tecnick数据集上分别实现了14.4%、15.7%和15.1%的BD-rate降低。

Conclusion: DCIC-sgp通过功能分解和深度调制，有效分离信息流，提升了图像压缩的性能和视觉质量。

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Result: VDMs在ARC-AGI、ConceptARC等任务中表现出比语言模型更高的数据效率。

Conclusion: 视频预训练为视觉基础模型的发展提供了有效的归纳偏置，具有潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

Method: Kineo利用现成的2D关键点检测器，结合置信驱动的时空采样和图优化，实现相机校准和3D重建。

Result: 在EgoHumans和Human3.6M数据集上，Kineo显著降低了相机误差和关节位置误差，处理速度快于视频时长。

Conclusion: Kineo为无需校准的运动捕捉提供了高效、高精度的解决方案，代码已开源以促进实际应用。

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

*Kyungmin Lee,Sihyun Yu,Jinwoo Shin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Decoupled MeanFlow 是一种解码策略，将流模型转换为流映射模型，无需架构修改，实现高效采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决去噪生成模型因离散化误差需要多步采样的问题，同时保持与预训练模型的兼容性。

Method: 通过条件化扩散变换器的最终块于后续时间步，将预训练流模型直接转换为流映射模型。

Result: 在 ImageNet 256x256 和 512x512 上，1步 FID 分别为 2.16 和 2.12，4步 FID 接近流模型性能。

Conclusion: Decoupled MeanFlow 高效且兼容性强，显著提升采样速度与生成质量。

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如PTM和HSH）在捕捉复杂反射场时存在局限性，而NeuralRTI虽然质量高，但计算成本大，难以在有限硬件上实现。

Method: 通过知识蒸馏技术，训练一个更小的网络来近似NeuralRTI的解码器，从而降低计算成本。

Result: 新方法在保持高质量的同时，显著降低了计算成本，使其在有限硬件上也能高效运行。

Conclusion: DisK-NeuralRTI是一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持高质量的同时，降低NeuralRTI的计算负担。

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

<details>

Motivation: MLLMs在需要视觉规划和想象的复杂场景中表现不佳，人类通过草图进行视觉思考的方式启发了该研究。

Method: 框架包含Context-Aware Vision Head和Sketch Decoder，将视觉生成集成到MLLMs的自回归推理过程中。

Result: 在MazePlanning数据集上，Latent Sketchpad表现优于或与骨干模型相当，且适用于多种MLLMs。

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了MLLMs的视觉思维，为人机交互和应用开辟了新机会。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

TL;DR: OSWorld-MCP是一个新的基准测试，用于评估多模态代理的工具调用、GUI操作和决策能力，强调工具调用能力的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去对多模态代理的评估主要关注GUI交互能力，而忽略了工具调用能力，导致评估不公平。

Method: 设计了一个自动化代码生成管道来创建工具，并结合现有工具，通过手动验证生成158个高质量工具。

Result: 评估显示工具调用能力显著提升任务成功率，但最强模型的工具调用率仍较低（36.3%）。

Conclusion: OSWorld-MCP为评估复杂工具辅助环境中的代理性能设定了新标准，并揭示了改进空间。

Abstract: With advances in decision-making and reasoning capabilities, multimodal
agents show strong potential in computer application scenarios. Past
evaluations have mainly assessed GUI interaction skills, while tool invocation
abilities, such as those enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP), have been
largely overlooked. Comparing agents with integrated tool invocation to those
evaluated only on GUI interaction is inherently unfair. We present OSWorld-MCP,
the first comprehensive and fair benchmark for assessing computer-use agents'
tool invocation, GUI operation, and decision-making abilities in a real-world
environment. We design a novel automated code-generation pipeline to create
tools and combine them with a curated selection from existing tools. Rigorous
manual validation yields 158 high-quality tools (covering 7 common
applications), each verified for correct functionality, practical
applicability, and versatility. Extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art
multimodal agents on OSWorld-MCP show that MCP tools generally improve task
success rates (e.g., from 8.3% to 20.4% for OpenAI o3 at 15 steps, from 40.1%
to 43.3% for Claude 4 Sonnet at 50 steps), underscoring the importance of
assessing tool invocation capabilities. However, even the strongest models have
relatively low tool invocation rates, Only 36.3%, indicating room for
improvement and highlighting the benchmark's challenge. By explicitly measuring
MCP tool usage skills, OSWorld-MCP deepens understanding of multimodal agents
and sets a new standard for evaluating performance in complex, tool-assisted
environments. Our code, environment, and data are publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT成像中散射会导致CT值偏差和组织对比度降低，影响诊断准确性，因此需要一种有效的散射伪影校正方法。

Method: 使用高斯径向基函数建模点散射函数，并将其嵌入KAN网络层，结合物理特性和非线性映射能力学习散射特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效校正重建图像中的散射伪影，并在定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合物理先验和深度学习，显著提升了散射校正的准确性，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成AI技术的快速发展导致伪造人脸图像威胁AI安全和数字媒体完整性，亟需鲁棒的检测方法。

Method: 使用双分支网络（RGB分支和频率分支），引入通道注意力模块和FSC Loss（结合焦点损失、监督对比损失和频率中心边缘损失）。

Result: 在DiFF基准测试中表现优异，超越人类平均准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法有效，有助于保护AI生态系统免受视觉伪造攻击。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the creation of highly
realistic forged facial images, posing significant threats to AI security,
digital media integrity, and public trust. Face forgery techniques, ranging
from face swapping and attribute editing to powerful diffusion-based image
synthesis, are increasingly being used for malicious purposes such as
misinformation, identity fraud, and defamation. This growing challenge
underscores the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection
methods as a critical component of AI security infrastructure. In this work, we
propose a novel dual-branch convolutional neural network for face forgery
detection that leverages complementary cues from both spatial and frequency
domains. The RGB branch captures semantic information, while the frequency
branch focuses on high-frequency artifacts that are difficult for generative
models to suppress. A channel attention module is introduced to adaptively fuse
these heterogeneous features, highlighting the most informative channels for
forgery discrimination. To guide the network's learning process, we design a
unified loss function, FSC Loss, that combines focal loss, supervised
contrastive loss, and a frequency center margin loss to enhance class
separability and robustness. We evaluate our model on the DiFF benchmark, which
includes forged images generated from four representative methods:
text-to-image, image-to-image, face swap, and face edit. Our method achieves
strong performance across all categories and outperforms average human
accuracy. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness and its potential
contribution to safeguarding AI ecosystems against visual forgery attacks.

Abstract: Interpretation of giga-pixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is an important but
difficult task for pathologists. Their diagnostic accuracy is estimated to
average around 70%. Adding a second pathologist does not substantially improve
decision consistency. The field lacks adequate behavioral data to explain
diagnostic errors and inconsistencies. To fill in this gap, we present
PathoGaze1.0, a comprehensive behavioral dataset capturing the dynamic visual
search and decision-making processes of the full diagnostic workflow during
cancer diagnosis. The dataset comprises 18.69 hours of eye-tracking, mouse
interaction, stimulus tracking, viewport navigation, and diagnostic decision
data (EMSVD) collected from 19 pathologists interpreting 397 WSIs. The data
collection process emphasizes ecological validity through an
application-grounded testbed, called PTAH. In total, we recorded 171,909
fixations, 263,320 saccades, and 1,867,362 mouse interaction events. In
addition, such data could also be used to improve the training of both

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Diffusion-in-Transformer的图像编辑方法缺乏对编辑程度的有效控制，限制了定制化结果的实现。

Method: 通过分析DiT模型中的MM-Attention机制，发现Query和Key令牌共享一个仅依赖层的偏置向量，提出GRAG方法重新加权delta值以调节编辑强度。

Result: 实验表明，GRAG仅需四行代码即可集成到现有框架中，显著提升编辑质量，且比Classifier-Free Guidance实现更平滑和精确的控制。

Conclusion: GRAG是一种简单有效的方法，无需调参即可实现连续精细的编辑控制，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at

Motivation: 解决传统方法和生成方法在处理大时间间隔或语义差异时的局限性。

Method: 结合结构引导（如线图和运动流）与生成合成，无需微调。

Result: 在定量指标和用户研究中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SAGE能够生成平滑且语义一致的视频过渡。

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

*Yihao Li,Saeed Salehi,Lyle Ungar,Konrad P. Kording*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Vision Transformers (ViTs) 自然具备对象绑定能力，通过自监督预训练目标获得，而非架构特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨ViTs是否自然具备对象绑定能力，以及这种能力如何影响其性能。

Method: 使用相似性探针解码ViTs中的IsSameObject属性，分析其在不同预训练目标下的表现。

Result: 自监督ViTs（如DINO、MAE、CLIP）表现出强对象绑定能力，而ImageNet监督模型较弱。IsSameObject信号主动引导注意力。

Conclusion: ViTs通过预训练目标自然获得对象绑定能力，挑战了其缺乏对象绑定的观点。

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Result: 在ImageNet基准测试中，ProMoE在Rectified Flow和DDPM目标下均超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 显式语义指导对视觉MoE至关重要，ProMoE为视觉任务提供了高效扩展模型容量的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete

In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型无法利用未来信息指导当前生成，导致相机轨迹引导时发生碰撞和崩溃。

Method: 提出GVS，采用并行采样算法，结合Omni Guidance技术增强时间一致性，并支持循环闭合机制。

Result: GVS实现了稳定、无碰撞且帧间一致的相机引导视频生成，适用于复杂路径如不可能楼梯。

Conclusion: GVS通过并行采样和未来条件化，显著提升了相机引导视频生成的质量和一致性。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best

### [73] [An Enhanced Dual Transformer Contrastive Network for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23617)
*Phuong Q. Dao,Mark Roantree,Vuong M. Ngo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BERT-ViT-EF的新型多模态情感分析模型，并通过扩展的DTCN进一步优化性能，实验结果表明其在两个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态情感分析（MSA）通过结合文本和图像数据，能够比单模态方法更准确地理解人类情感。本文旨在通过改进模型架构和训练策略，提升多模态情感分析的性能。

Method: 提出BERT-ViT-EF模型，采用早期融合策略结合BERT和ViT编码器；进一步扩展为DTCN，增加Transformer层和对比学习以优化特征对齐。

Result: 在TumEmo数据集上达到78.4%准确率和78.3% F1分数，在MVSA-Single数据集上表现也具竞争力。

Conclusion: 早期融合和深度上下文建模在基于Transformer的多模态情感分析中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) seeks to understand human emotions by
jointly analyzing data from multiple modalities typically text and images
offering a richer and more accurate interpretation than unimodal approaches. In
this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful
Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input
through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal
interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further
enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual
Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN
incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine
textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text
and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning.
Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy
(78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on
MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements
highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in
Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.

### [74] [Speeding Up MACE: Low-Precision Tricks for Equivarient Force Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23621)
*Alexandre Benoit*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了如何通过降低计算精度和优化GPU内核来加速SO(3)-等变模型（如MACE）的分子动力学模拟，同时保持物理保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高计算成本限制了机器学习力场在分子动力学模拟中的应用，因此需要探索降低精度和优化GPU内核的方法以提升效率。

Method: 通过分析MACE的计算瓶颈，评估低精度执行策略，比较e3nn和cuEquivariance后端，并测试FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16设置在不同场景下的表现。

Result: cuEquivariance后端减少了约3倍的推理延迟，BF16/FP16线性层进一步提升了4倍速度，且不影响模拟结果。训练中使用半精度会降低力场精度。

Conclusion: 混合精度推理和优化的GPU内核可以显著加速力场计算，建议默认使用FP32的cuEquivariance，并在线性层启用BF16/FP16以获得最大吞吐量。

Abstract: Machine-learning force fields can deliver accurate molecular dynamics (MD) at
high computational cost. For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is
little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and
GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This
thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by
identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution
policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA
cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32
accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy
training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces
inference latency by about $3\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16
within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and
thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability.
Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq
modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused
equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate
state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A
practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable
BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum
throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on
Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and
pipeline fusion.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性攻击可能导致医疗AI系统误诊或延误治疗，威胁患者安全，尤其是在弱势群体中。

Method: 通过皮肤病数据集进行实证实验，包括威胁建模、实验基准测试和模型评估。

Result: 防御措施（如对抗训练和蒸馏）能降低攻击成功率，但需与模型在干净数据上的性能平衡。

Conclusion: 需结合技术、伦理和政策方法，构建更具韧性和公平性的医疗AI系统。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks pose a severe risk to AI systems used in healthcare,
capable of misleading models into dangerous misclassifications that can delay
treatments or cause misdiagnoses. These attacks, often imperceptible to human
perception, threaten patient safety, particularly in underserved populations.
Our study explores these vulnerabilities through empirical experimentation on a
dermatological dataset, where adversarial methods significantly reduce
classification accuracy. Through detailed threat modeling, experimental
benchmarking, and model evaluation, we demonstrate both the severity of the
threat and the partial success of defenses like adversarial training and
distillation. Our results show that while defenses reduce attack success rates,
they must be balanced against model performance on clean data. We conclude with
a call for integrated technical, ethical, and policy-based approaches to build
more resilient, equitable AI in healthcare.

*Tiago Mendonça dos Santos,Rafael Izbicki,Luís Gustavo Esteves*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiNo和RanBu是两种浅层森林方法，通过将少量深度受限的树转换为高效的距离加权预测器，显著降低了推理延迟和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决随机森林在延迟敏感或资源受限环境中的高推理延迟和内存需求问题。

Method: DiNo通过最近共同祖先测量共表型距离，RanBu对Breiman的经典邻近度量应用核平滑。两者均在森林训练后操作，无需额外树生长。

Result: RanBu在高噪声环境下匹配或超越全深度随机森林的准确性，同时减少训练和推理时间达95%；DiNo在低噪声环境下实现最佳偏差-方差权衡。

Conclusion: 两种方法可直接扩展到分位数回归，保持准确性并显著提升速度，适用于结构化表格数据。

Abstract: Random Forest ensembles are a strong baseline for tabular prediction tasks,
but their reliance on hundreds of deep trees often results in high inference
latency and memory demands, limiting deployment in latency-sensitive or
resource-constrained environments. We introduce DiNo (Distance with Nodes) and
RanBu (Random Bushes), two shallow-forest methods that convert a small set of
depth-limited trees into efficient, distance-weighted predictors. DiNo measures
cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs,
while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure.
Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are
grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only
lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25
public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random
forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus
inference time by up to 95\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in
low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly
to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains. The
implementation is available as an open-source R/C++ package at
https://github.com/tiagomendonca/dirf. We focus on structured tabular random
samples (i.i.d.), leaving extensions to other modalities for future work.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，用于抑郁症检测和知识扩展，通过迭代学习提升预测准确性和医学知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究忽视了通过预测过程扩展医学知识的机会，本文旨在同时提升预测准确性和知识扩展。

Method: 开发了闭环LLM-知识图谱框架，结合预测和知识扩展的迭代学习循环。

Result: 框架提升了预测准确性并扩展了医学知识，专家评估确认了新的临床相关发现。

Conclusion: 框架展示了计算模型与领域知识的共同进化，为动态风险监测提供了基础。

Abstract: Social media user-generated content (UGC) provides real-time, self-reported
indicators of mental health conditions such as depression, offering a valuable
source for predictive analytics. While prior studies integrate medical
knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to
simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a
Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that
integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle.
In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs
depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph
represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the
knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and
entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph
under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using
large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical
understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically
meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to
existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize
prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually
reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical
understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the
co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a
foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other
dynamic risk monitoring contexts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TracePile是一个大规模数据集，将代码执行转化为显式的链式执行（CoE）推理步骤，提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码中的推理通常隐含且与语法或实现噪声纠缠，直接训练效果不佳，需要显式推理步骤。

Method: 构建TracePile数据集（2.6百万样本），包含数学、算法等领域，通过变量追踪和代码重写增强逻辑粒度。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，TracePile显著提升模型性能，如LLaMA3.1-8B在数学数据集上平均提升7.1%。

Conclusion: TracePile通过显式推理步骤有效提升大语言模型的推理能力，尤其在数学和算法任务中表现突出。

Abstract: Building robust and general reasoning ability is a central goal in the
development of large language models (LLMs). Recent efforts increasingly turn
to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and
diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering,
and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and
entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw
code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus
of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit,
step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of
Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical
algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing
questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code
diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups:
continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage
finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5,
and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and
algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements. Notably, TracePile boosts
LLaMA3.1-8B by 7.1\% on average across nine math datasets and delivers clear
gains on LiveCodeBench, CRUX, and MMLU under two-stage fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种从数值时间序列推断结构化事件的任务，并开发了一个结合事件提取器和合成生成器的框架，显著优于现有LLM基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注预测或趋势描述，缺乏对驱动数值变化的潜在事件的解释，因此需要一种能够从数值输入推断结构化事件的方法。

Method: 提出了一个推理感知框架，包括代理引导的事件提取器（AGE）、基于Hawkes的合成生成器（EveDTS）和两阶段微调管道。

Result: 在多领域数据集上，该方法在事件级精确率和召回率上显著优于LLM基线。

Conclusion: 该方法为连接定量推理和语义理解提供了新方向，使LLM能够直接从数值动态解释和预测事件。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal
reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series
signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or
trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical
changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we
introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to
infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current
text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment
challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an
agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based
synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a
time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons
over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs
structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our
method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision
and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative
reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict
events directly from numerical dynamics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖两两偏好优化，忽略了更丰富的人类反馈形式。

Method: 提出RCPO框架，通过最大似然估计结合偏好优化和排名选择模型，支持多种选择模型。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RCPO表现优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: RCPO通过直接利用排名偏好数据，结合合适的选择模型，提供了更有效的对齐方法。

Abstract: Alignment of large language models (LLMs) has predominantly relied on
pairwise preference optimization, where annotators select the better of two
responses to a prompt. While simple, this approach overlooks the opportunity to
learn from richer forms of human feedback, such as multiwise comparisons and
top-$k$ rankings. We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a
unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice
modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible,
supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several
existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled
training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework
with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and
Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across
AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms
competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference
data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.
It offers a versatile and extensible foundation for incorporating (ranked)
choice modeling into LLM training.

<details>

Motivation: 高分辨率科学模拟和观测系统产生的海量时空数据需要高效、误差受限的压缩方法。

Method: LLMCOMP将3D场量化为离散标记，通过Z-order曲线排列以保持局部性，并应用覆盖引导采样训练自回归变换器。

Result: 在多个再分析数据集上，LLMCOMP在严格误差限制下压缩比提升高达30%。

Conclusion: LLM展示了作为高保真科学数据通用压缩器的潜力。

Abstract: The rapid growth of high-resolution scientific simulations and observation
systems is generating massive spatiotemporal datasets, making efficient,
error-bounded compression increasingly important. Meanwhile, decoder-only large
language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in modeling
complex sequential data. In this paper, we propose LLMCOMP, a novel lossy
compression paradigm that leverages decoder-only large LLMs to model scientific
data. LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via
Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to
enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with
spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the
model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback
corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis
datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error
bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose
compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.

Motivation: 预训练扩散模型在零样本逆问题解决中表现出色，但过度或不足的观测信息整合会影响生成过程或无法满足约束条件。

Method: 提出“噪声组合采样”方法，通过合成最优噪声向量来近似测量分数，替代标准去噪扩散概率模型中的噪声项。

Result: 该方法适用于多种逆问题求解器，尤其在生成步骤较少时，性能优越且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 噪声组合采样方法显著提高了鲁棒性和稳定性，无需依赖逐步超参数调整。

Abstract: Pretrained diffusion models have demonstrated strong capabilities in
zero-shot inverse problem solving by incorporating observation information into
the generation process of the diffusion models. However, this presents an
inherent dilemma: excessive integration can disrupt the generative process,
while insufficient integration fails to emphasize the constraints imposed by
the inverse problem. To address this, we propose \emph{Noise Combination
Sampling}, a novel method that synthesizes an optimal noise vector from a noise
subspace to approximate the measurement score, replacing the noise term in the
standard Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models process. This enables
conditional information to be naturally embedded into the generation process
without reliance on step-wise hyperparameter tuning. Our method can be applied
to a wide range of inverse problem solvers, including image compression, and,
particularly when the number of generation steps $T$ is small, achieves
superior performance with negligible computational overhead, significantly
improving robustness and stability.

Conclusion: MAS函数可用于构建通用模型，实验验证了其在集合包含任务中的优势。

Abstract: Motivated by applications for set containment problems, we consider the
following fundamental problem: can we design set-to-vector functions so that
the natural partial order on sets is preserved, namely $S\subseteq T \text{ if
and only if } F(S)\leq F(T) $. We call functions satisfying this property
Monotone and Separating (MAS) set functions. % We establish lower and upper
bounds for the vector dimension necessary to obtain MAS functions, as a
function of the cardinality of the multisets and the underlying ground set. In
the important case of an infinite ground set, we show that MAS functions do not
exist, but provide a model called our which provably enjoys a relaxed MAS
property we name "weakly MAS" and is stable in the sense of Holder continuity.
We also show that MAS functions can be used to construct universal models that
are monotone by construction and can approximate all monotone set functions.
Experimentally, we consider a variety of set containment tasks. The experiments
show the benefit of using our our model, in comparison with standard set models
which do not incorporate set containment as an inductive bias. Our code is
available in https://github.com/yonatansverdlov/Monotone-Embedding.

Motivation: 用户标注（主动或被动）常含噪声，SKEL虽能评估标注准确性，但未考虑用户反馈。

Result: 研究发现平衡用户努力与数据质量的挑战，SKEL能减少标注努力并提升数据质量。

Conclusion: SKEL在真实用户环境中表现良好，但需进一步优化用户参与与数据质量的平衡。

Abstract: Any digital personal assistant, whether used to support task performance,
answer questions, or manage work and daily life, including fitness schedules,
requires high-quality annotations to function properly. However, user
annotations, whether actively produced or inferred from context (e.g., data
from smartphone sensors), are often subject to errors and noise. Previous
research on Skeptical Learning (SKEL) addressed the issue of noisy labels by
comparing offline active annotations with passive data, allowing for an
evaluation of annotation accuracy. However, this evaluation did not include
confirmation from end-users, the best judges of their own context. In this
study, we evaluate SKEL's performance in real-world conditions with actual
users who can refine the input labels based on their current perspectives and
needs. The study involves university students using the iLog mobile application
on their devices over a period of four weeks. The results highlight the
challenges of finding the right balance between user effort and data quality,
as well as the potential benefits of using SKEL, which include reduced
annotation effort and improved quality of collected data.

Abstract: Flight delay prediction has become a key focus in air traffic management, as
delays highlight inefficiencies that impact overall network performance. This
paper presents a lightweight large language model-based multimodal flight delay
prediction, formulated from the perspective of air traffic controllers
monitoring aircraft delay after entering the terminal area. The approach
integrates trajectory representations with textual aeronautical information,
including flight information, weather reports, and aerodrome notices, by
adapting trajectory data into the language modality to capture airspace
conditions. Experimental results show that the model consistently achieves
sub-minute prediction error by effectively leveraging contextual information
related to the sources of delay. The framework demonstrates that linguistic
understanding, when combined with cross-modality adaptation of trajectory
information, enhances delay prediction. Moreover, the approach shows
practicality and scalability for real-world operations, supporting real-time
updates that refine predictions upon receiving new operational information.

Abstract: Premise selection is a key bottleneck for scaling theorem proving in large

isolation, ignoring the web of dependencies that connects them. We present a
graph-augmented approach that combines dense text embeddings of Lean
formalizations with graph neural networks over a heterogeneous dependency graph
capturing both state--premise and premise--premise relations. On the LeanDojo

Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation
model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data
modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic
health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us
(AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex
relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The
methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model
space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on
AoU data demonstrates the model's predictive value for the onset of various
conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay
between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom
classification tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility and efficiency.
This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction,
proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment
strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and
actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare.

TL;DR: MuMo是一个多模态分子表示框架，通过结构化融合和渐进注入机制解决3D构象不可靠性和模态崩溃问题，在多个基准任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态分子模型常因3D构象不可靠和模态崩溃而受限，MuMo旨在提升其鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 采用结构化融合管道（SFP）结合2D拓扑和3D几何，并通过渐进注入（PI）机制不对称整合模态信息。

Result: 在29个基准任务中平均提升2.7%，并在22个任务中排名第一，LD50任务提升27%。

Conclusion: MuMo验证了其对3D构象噪声的鲁棒性和多模态融合在分子表示中的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular models often suffer from 3D conformer unreliability and
modality collapse, limiting their robustness and generalization. We propose
MuMo, a structured multimodal fusion framework that addresses these challenges
in molecular representation through two key strategies. To reduce the
instability of conformer-dependent fusion, we design a Structured Fusion
Pipeline (SFP) that combines 2D topology and 3D geometry into a unified and
stable structural prior. To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion,
we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically
integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific
modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space
backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information
propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and
MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the
best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a
27% improvement on the LD50 task. These results validate its robustness to 3D
conformer noise and the effectiveness of multimodal fusion in molecular
representation. The code is available at: github.com/selmiss/MuMo.

TL;DR: SAL-T是一种基于物理启发的线性Transformer改进模型，通过空间分区和卷积层降低计算复杂度，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在高能粒子碰撞中表现优异，但计算复杂度高，难以在高数据吞吐环境下部署。

Method: 引入空间感知分区和卷积层，结合运动学特征和喷注物理知识，保持线性注意力。

Result: 在喷注分类任务中优于标准线性Transformer，性能接近全注意力Transformer，且资源消耗更低。

Conclusion: SAL-T是一种高效且低延迟的Transformer改进模型，适用于高能物理和其他点云分类任务。

Abstract: Transformers are very effective in capturing both global and local
correlations within high-energy particle collisions, but they present
deployment challenges in high-data-throughput environments, such as the CERN
LHC. The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial
resources and increases latency during inference. In order to address these
issues, we introduce the Spatially Aware Linear Transformer (SAL-T), a
physics-inspired enhancement of the linformer architecture that maintains
linear attention. Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of
particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between
regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers
to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In
addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks,
SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention
transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency
during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset
(ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at
https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.

TL;DR: LRQK是一种两阶段框架，通过低秩分解和混合GPU-CPU缓存机制，显著减少LLMs中KV缓存的内存开销，同时保持精确的注意力输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着输入文本长度增加，KV缓存在LLMs中导致高昂的GPU内存成本，限制了资源受限设备上的长上下文推理。现有方法（如KV量化和剪枝）会损失数值精度或保留次优的键值对。

Method: LRQK在预填充阶段将全精度查询和键矩阵分解为紧凑的低秩因子，并在解码阶段使用低维投影计算代理注意力分数。通过混合GPU-CPU缓存和命中-缺失机制，仅传输缺失的全精度KV对。

Result: 在RULER和LongBench基准测试中，LRQK在长上下文设置中匹配或超越领先的稀疏注意力方法，同时显著节省内存且精度损失最小。

Conclusion: LRQK通过低秩分解和混合缓存策略，有效解决了KV缓存的内存问题，为资源受限设备上的长上下文推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes
prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource
constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning,
reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal
retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention
(LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query
and key matrices into compact rank-\(r\) factors during the prefill stage, and
then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores
in \(\mathcal{O}(lr)\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the
top-\(k\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed
GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing
full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while
reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and
LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK
matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings,
while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy. Our
code is available at https://github.com/tenghuilee/LRQK.

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在许多领域取得了突破，但其庞大的模型尺寸和高计算成本在资源受限的边缘设备上部署时面临挑战。现有层剪枝方法忽略了层间依赖关系，导致性能下降。

Method: CLP框架包含可微分凹门算法和剪枝端点调优策略，前者通过梯度优化自动识别最佳剪枝层段，后者通过微调剪枝段相邻层恢复性能。

Result: 在多个模型架构和尺寸上，CLP显著优于现有基线方法。例如，在20%剪枝率下，LLaMA3-70B的平均性能保留率为95.34%，优于基线4.29%-30.52%。

Conclusion: CLP不仅提升了剪枝效果，还能与量化技术结合进一步压缩模型，仅带来轻微性能损失。

Abstract: Although large language models (LLMs) have achieved revolutionary
breakthroughs in many fields, their large model size and high computational
cost pose significant challenges for practical deployment on
resource-constrained edge devices. To this end, layer pruning has been proposed
to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers.
However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics
to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies
between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely
degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel
continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a
differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best
continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a
cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by
fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive
experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and
Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate
of $20\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\%$ on
LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\%$-$30.52\%$. Furthermore, CLP can
be seamlessly combined with quantization to further compress the model with
only a slight performance loss.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，SAEA显著提升了多种模型的预测性能。

Conclusion: SAEA有效解决了交通预测中的误差自相关问题，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of
research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing
spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of
training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that
the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However,
this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by
both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the
performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current
studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally
Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed
to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic
forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a
random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a
spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic
dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error
correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly
formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is
introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned
coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an
inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically
refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time
forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on
different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting
models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.

Conclusion: 该框架为精准农业中优化冷等离子体种子发芽提供了决策支持工具。

Abstract: Cold plasma (CP) is an eco-friendly method to enhance seed germination, yet
outcomes remain difficult to predict due to complex seed--plasma--environment
interactions. This study introduces the first machine learning framework to
forecast germination uplift in soybean, barley, sunflower, radish, and tomato
under dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma. Among the models tested (GB,
XGB, ET, and hybrids), Extra Trees (ET) performed best (R\textsuperscript{2} =
0.919; RMSE = 3.21; MAE = 2.62), improving to R\textsuperscript{2} = 0.925
after feature reduction. Engineering analysis revealed a hormetic response:
negligible effects at $<$7 kV or $<$200 s, maximum germination at 7--15 kV for
200--500 s, and reduced germination beyond 20 kV or prolonged exposures.
Discharge power was also a dominant factor, with germination rate maximizing at
$\geq$100 W with low exposure time. Species and cultivar-level predictions
showed radish (MAE = 1.46) and soybean (MAE = 2.05) were modeled with high
consistency, while sunflower remained slightly higher variable (MAE = 3.80).
Among cultivars, Williams (MAE = 1.23) and Sari (1.33) were well predicted,
while Arian (2.86) and Ny\'{\i}rs\'{e}gi fekete (3.74) were comparatively
poorly captured. This framework was also embedded into MLflow, providing a
decision-support tool for optimizing CP seed germination in precision
agriculture.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优于基础模型，调整胜率达65.9%和62.3%。

Conclusion: ELBO-KTO证明无配对偏好优化是扩散语言模型中对齐的可行替代方案。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (dLLMs) are an emerging alternative to
autoregressive (AR) generators, but aligning them to human preferences is
challenging because sequence log-likelihoods are intractable and pairwise
preference data are costly to collect. We introduce ELBO-KTO, which combines an
ELBO surrogate for diffusion log-likelihoods with a prospect-theoretic,
unpaired preference objective (Kahneman Tversky Optimization, KTO). We analyze
the bias and variance induced by the ELBO substitution and employ
variance-reduction practices that stabilize gradients during training. Applied
to LLaDA-8B-Instruct, ELBO-KTO yields \textbf{65.9\%} and \textbf{62.3\%}
adjusted win rates on kto-mix-14k and UltraFeedback-Binary, respectively,
versus the base model under an automatic LLM judge. Across downstream tasks,
including GSM8K, MMLU, and additional reasoning/knowledge benchmarks, ELBO-KTO
trained on UltraFeedback-Binary performs on par with or better than the base
model under identical decoding. This establishes unpaired preference
optimization as a viable alternative to pairwise alignment in diffusion LLMs.

Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine
learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational
techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks.
This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network)
for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for
classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine
learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional
and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing
to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to
extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These
features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal
Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM
models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to
transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance,
we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified
cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results
demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models,
achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This
research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image
classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through
hybrid quantum-classical modeling.

Abstract: Pneumonia poses a significant global health challenge, demanding accurate and
timely diagnosis. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia
detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in
feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets.
To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional
Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature
extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for
pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a
quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2
image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling
layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These
quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves
a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable
classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and
sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis,
particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. This research lays the
foundation for integrating quantum computing into deep-learning-driven medical
diagnostic systems, offering a computationally efficient alternative to
traditional approaches.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of column-averaged CO2 (XCO2) over agricultural landscapes
is essential for guiding emission mitigation strategies. We present a
Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer with Wavelets (ST-ViWT) framework that
reconstructs continuous, uncertainty-quantified XCO2 fields from OCO-2 across
southern Canada, emphasizing poultry-intensive regions. The model fuses wavelet
time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology,
vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT
attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions
lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust
generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction
of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals
a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43);
high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced
summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard
machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces
with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse
observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with
national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions,
refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions. Importantly,
transformer-based Earth observation enables scalable, transparent, spatially

Abstract: Compressed file formats are the corner stone of efficient data storage and

compressed files to design an effective tokenization and encoding strategy. By
leveraging this compact encoding, a standard transformer can directly learn
semantic representations from compressed data streams, bypassing the need for
raw byte-level processing or full media decoding. Our proposal substantially
reduces the number of tokens required for semantic classification, thereby
lowering both computational complexity and memory usage. Through extensive
experiments across diverse datasets, coding schemes, and modalities, we show
that TEMPEST achieves accuracy competitive wit the state-of-the-art while
delivering efficiency gains in memory and compute.

Abstract: Structural topology optimization (TO) is central to engineering design but
remains computationally intensive due to complex physics and hard constraints.
Existing deep-learning methods are limited to fixed square grids, a few
hand-coded boundary conditions, and post-hoc optimization, preventing general
deployment. We introduce Optimize Any Topology (OAT), a foundation-model
framework that directly predicts minimum-compliance layouts for arbitrary
aspect ratios, resolutions, volume fractions, loads, and fixtures. OAT combines
a resolution- and shape-agnostic autoencoder with an implicit neural-field
decoder and a conditional latent-diffusion model trained on OpenTO, a new
corpus of 2.2 million optimized structures covering 2 million unique
boundary-condition configurations. On four public benchmarks and two
challenging unseen tests, OAT lowers mean compliance up to 90% relative to the
best prior models and delivers sub-1 second inference on a single GPU across
resolutions from 64 x 64 to 256 x 256 and aspect ratios as high as 10:1. These
results establish OAT as a general, fast, and resolution-free framework for
physics-aware topology optimization and provide a large-scale dataset to spur
further research in generative modeling for inverse design. Code & data can be

Abstract: Accurate traffic flow forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation
systems and urban traffic management. However, single model approaches often
fail to capture the complex, nonlinear, and multi scale temporal patterns in
traffic flow data. This study proposes a decomposition driven hybrid framework
that integrates Seasonal Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) with three
complementary predictive models. STL first decomposes the original time series
into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory
(LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations. The
final forecast is obtained through multiplicative integration of the sub model
predictions. Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection
between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost
hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA,

TL;DR: MoE模型与密集网络的机制差异尚不明确，研究发现网络稀疏性（活跃专家比例）更能表征MoE，并提出新的专家专业化定义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索MoE模型与密集网络在机制上的差异，以理解其独特行为。

Method: 分析特征稀疏性和重要性对MoE的影响，提出新指标衡量专家间的叠加性。

Result: 网络稀疏性更高的模型表现出更强的单义性，专家围绕一致特征组合组织。

Conclusion: MoE的网络稀疏性可能在不牺牲性能的情况下提升模型可解释性，挑战可解释性与能力对立的假设。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) models have become central to scaling large language
models, yet their mechanistic differences from dense networks remain poorly
understood. Previous work has explored how dense models use
\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how
superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE
models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that
neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase
changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts)
better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition
across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network
sparsity exhibit greater \emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of
expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than
load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature
combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network
sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing
performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and
capability are fundamentally at odds.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分解的损失函数DBLoss，通过分别计算季节性和趋势分量的损失并加权，显著提升了时间序列预测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MSE损失函数在捕捉时间序列的季节性和趋势时表现不足，即使使用分解模块。

Method: 使用指数移动平均分解时间序列为季节性和趋势分量，分别计算损失并加权。

Result: 实验表明DBLoss显著提升了多种先进模型的性能。

Conclusion: DBLoss为时间序列损失函数设计提供了新视角，是一种通用且有效的方法。

Abstract: Time series forecasting holds significant value in various domains such as
economics, traffic, energy, and AIOps, as accurate predictions facilitate
informed decision-making. However, the existing Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss
function sometimes fails to accurately capture the seasonality or trend within
the forecasting horizon, even when decomposition modules are used in the
forward propagation to model the trend and seasonality separately. To address
these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss
function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to
decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the
forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components
separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can
be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of
state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new
perspective on the design of time series loss functions.

TL;DR: HIPE是一种新的贝叶斯优化初始化策略，通过信息论原理平衡预测不确定性减少和超参数学习，优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统初始化方法（如准随机设计）忽视了预测不确定性减少和高效超参数学习的重要性。

Method: 提出HIPE策略，结合信息论原理，在高斯过程中推导闭式解。

Result: HIPE在预测准确性、超参数识别和后续优化性能上优于标准初始化策略。

Conclusion: HIPE在少样本贝叶斯优化中表现优异，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive
black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian
Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization
performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of
batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a
critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding
subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on
(quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches
neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to
reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during
initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict
with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose
Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition
strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter
learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form
expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its
effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO.
Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in
terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent
optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings
relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.

TL;DR: Chimera是一种结合了LLM、符号约束引擎和因果推理模块的神经-符号-因果架构，显著提升了自主决策代理在高风险领域的可靠性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）作为自主决策代理在高风险领域部署时存在严重脆弱性，仅因提示框架不同可能导致灾难性结果。

Method: 提出Chimera架构，整合LLM策略师、形式化验证的符号约束引擎和因果推理模块，通过52周模拟在电子商务环境中进行基准测试。

Result: Chimera在利润（最高220万美元）和品牌信任度（提升20.86%）上显著优于纯LLM或仅带符号约束的LLM代理，且形式化验证显示零约束违规。

Conclusion: 架构设计而非提示工程是决定自主代理在生产环境中可靠性的关键，Chimera展示了其在高风险领域的实用性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Large language models show promise as autonomous decision-making agents, yet
their deployment in high-stakes domains remains fraught with risk. Without
architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness:
identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on
prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that
integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally
verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for
counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures
(LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a
realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics,
and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin
optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \$99K in
volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding
symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's
profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\$1.52M and \$1.96M
respectively, some cases +\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and
+10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness. Our TLA+
formal verification proves zero constraint violations across all scenarios.
These results establish that architectural design not prompt engineering
determines the reliability of autonomous agents in production environments. We
provide open-source implementations and interactive demonstrations for
reproducibility.

Motivation: 混沌系统的非线性特性导致预测困难，传统方法无法同时捕捉局部特征和全局依赖关系。

Method: 采用双分支架构，Transformer分支捕获长程依赖，BiLSTM分支提取局部时间特征，通过特征融合层增强预测精度。

Result: 在Lorenz系统的两个任务中，该框架表现优于单一分支架构，展示了其在混沌系统预测中的鲁棒性和有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架在混沌系统预测中具有显著优势，能够同时处理局部和全局特征。

Abstract: The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to
initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental
challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the
limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and
global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes
a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long
Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch
architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range
dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal
features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in
a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As
illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on
two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous
evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system
trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate
long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of
unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from
the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its
state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the
proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across
tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system
prediction.

Conclusion: DEPS通过学习参数化技能，显著提高了对未见任务的泛化能力，并生成可解释的技能。

Abstract: We present DEPS, an end-to-end algorithm for discovering parameterized skills
from expert demonstrations. Our method learns parameterized skill policies
jointly with a meta-policy that selects the appropriate discrete skill and
continuous parameters at each timestep. Using a combination of temporal
variational inference and information-theoretic regularization methods, we
address the challenge of degeneracy common in latent variable models, ensuring
that the learned skills are temporally extended, semantically meaningful, and
adaptable. We empirically show that learning parameterized skills from
multitask expert demonstrations significantly improves generalization to unseen
tasks. Our method outperforms multitask as well as skill learning baselines on
both LIBERO and MetaWorld benchmarks. We also demonstrate that DEPS discovers
interpretable parameterized skills, such as an object grasping skill whose
continuous arguments define the grasp location.

appropriate measurement of fairness in ML systems, systematic decomposition of
ML systems to anticipate bias dynamics, and effective interventions that reduce
algorithmic discrimination while maintaining system utility. I conclude by
discussing ongoing challenges and future research directions as ML systems,
including generative artificial intelligence, become increasingly integrated
into society. This work offers a foundation for ensuring that ML's societal
impact aligns with broader social values.

Motivation: 当前多模态模型在讽刺检测等复杂任务中表现不佳，需要识别跨模态相关线索并进行推理。

Method: 引入MUStReason基准测试，包含模态特定线索和推理步骤注释，并提出PragCoT框架以增强推理能力。

Result: 通过MUStReason定量和定性评估VideoLMs的讽刺分类性能和生成推理。

Conclusion: PragCoT框架能够引导VideoLMs关注隐含意图，提升讽刺检测能力。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a specific type of irony which involves discerning what is said
from what is meant. Detecting sarcasm depends not only on the literal content
of an utterance but also on non-verbal cues such as speaker's tonality, facial
expressions and conversational context. However, current multimodal models
struggle with complex tasks like sarcasm detection, which require identifying
relevant cues across modalities and pragmatically reasoning over them to infer
the speaker's intention. To explore these limitations in VideoLMs, we introduce
MUStReason, a diagnostic benchmark enriched with annotations of
modality-specific relevant cues and underlying reasoning steps to identify
sarcastic intent. In addition to benchmarking sarcasm classification
performance in VideoLMs, using MUStReason we quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the generated reasoning by disentangling the problem into perception
and reasoning, we propose PragCoT, a framework that steers VideoLMs to focus on
implied intentions over literal meaning, a property core to detecting sarcasm.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种框架，通过识别和利用非虚假潜在变量来减少奖励模型中的偏差，同时保留反映真实偏好的因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型常利用虚假相关性（如响应长度、歧视等），导致偏差问题日益突出。

Method: 假设观测数据由虚假和非虚假潜在变量生成，理论证明非虚假变量可识别，并提出变分推断方法恢复这些变量以训练奖励模型。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法有效减少了虚假相关性，提升了奖励模型的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架为奖励模型中的偏差问题提供了理论支持和实用解决方案。

Abstract: Recent alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human
feedback, have been widely adopted to align large language models with human
preferences by learning and leveraging reward models. In practice, these models
often exploit spurious correlations, involving, e.g., response length,
discrimination, sycophancy, and conceptual bias, which is a problem that has
received increasing attention. In this work, we propose a principled framework
that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying
factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of
the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is
generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that,
interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically
identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent
variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses
variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train
reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields
more robust reward models.

Result: COMBRL在奖励驱动和无监督RL设置中分别实现次线性遗憾和样本复杂度边界，实验表明其扩展性和样本效率优于现有方法。

Conclusion: COMBRL在连续时间强化学习中表现出色，优于基线方法，适用于多种深度RL任务。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time
dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often
continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time
reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using
nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic
models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an
uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily
maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic
uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to
continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret
in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without
extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments,
we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and
demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods,
and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.

Motivation: 研究Cobweb/4V模型在视觉领域中对灾难性遗忘的鲁棒性，探索其背后的机制。

Method: 提出三个假设，并通过与神经基线（如CobwebNN）在多个数据集上的实验验证。

Result: 自适应结构增强学习可塑性，稀疏更新减少干扰，信息论学习无需回顾旧数据即可保留知识。

Conclusion: 概念驱动的信息论方法为构建稳定且自适应的持续学习系统提供了潜力。

Abstract: Catastrophic forgetting remains a central challenge in continual learning,
where models are required to integrate new knowledge over time without losing
what they have previously learned. In prior work, we introduced Cobweb/4V, a
hierarchical concept formation model that exhibited robustness to catastrophic
forgetting in visual domains. Motivated by this robustness, we examine three
hypotheses regarding the factors that contribute to such stability: (1)
adaptive structural reorganization enhances knowledge retention, (2) sparse and
selective updates reduce interference, and (3) information-theoretic learning
based on sufficiency statistics provides advantages over gradient-based
backpropagation. To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural
baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework
introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring
enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and
the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without
revisiting past data. Together, these findings provide insight into mechanisms
that can mitigate catastrophic forgetting and highlight the potential of
concept-based, information-theoretic approaches for building stable and
adaptive continual learning systems.

Result: 在蛋白质结合剂设计任务中，RSS比RSO基线产生5倍的可设计结构和2-3倍的结构多样性。

Conclusion: RSS是一种高效探索蛋白质设计景观的原则性方法。

Abstract: Protein design using structure prediction models such as AlphaFold2 has shown
remarkable success, but existing approaches like relaxed sequence optimization
(RSO) rely on single-path gradient descent and ignore sequence-space
constraints, limiting diversity and designability. We introduce Relaxed
Sequence Sampling (RSS), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework that
integrates structural and evolutionary information for protein design. RSS
operates in continuous logit space, combining gradient-guided exploration with
protein language model-informed jumps. Its energy function couples
AlphaFold2-derived structural objectives with ESM2-derived sequence priors,
balancing accuracy and biological plausibility. In an in silico protein binder
design task, RSS produces 5$\times$ more designable structures and 2-3$\times$
greater structural diversity than RSO baselines, at equal computational cost.
These results highlight RSS as a principled approach for efficiently exploring
the protein design landscape.

Motivation: 传统台风集合预报系统计算成本高且难以完全捕捉大气非线性，FuXi-ENS通过可学习扰动方案改进预报能力。

Method: FuXi-ENS采用可学习扰动方案生成集合预报，并与ECMWF-ENS在2018年全球90个台风上进行系统对比。

Result: FuXi-ENS在台风物理变量和路径预测上更准确，但强度预测偏低；其大尺度环流和暖核周围能量分布更集中。

Conclusion: 可学习扰动方案能提升台风预报技能，为AI驱动的极端天气集合预报提供了新思路。

Abstract: Tropical cyclones (TCs) are highly destructive and inherently uncertain
weather systems. Ensemble forecasting helps quantify these uncertainties, yet
traditional systems are constrained by high computational costs and limited
capability to fully represent atmospheric nonlinearity. FuXi-ENS introduces a
learnable perturbation scheme for ensemble generation, representing a novel
AI-based forecasting paradigm. Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with
ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in
TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the
associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear
advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more
accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still
underestimates intensity relative to observations. Further dynamical and
thermodynamical analyses reveal that FuXi-ENS better captures large-scale
circulation, with moisture turbulent energy more tightly concentrated around
the TC warm core, whereas ECMWF-ENS exhibits a more dispersed distribution.
These findings highlight the potential of learnable perturbations to improve TC
forecasting skill and provide valuable insights for advancing AI-based ensemble
prediction of extreme weather events that have significant societal impacts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频的密集特性使得压缩会模糊语义，且自动特征表征有限，因此需要一种方法解释音频生成模型的潜在表示。

Result: 在DiffRhythm-VAE、EnCodec和WavTokenizer等模型上验证了方法的有效性，揭示了声学属性在合成过程中的演变。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于音频模态，还可扩展至视觉潜在空间生成模型的可解释分析。

Abstract: While sparse autoencoders (SAEs) successfully extract interpretable features
from language models, applying them to audio generation faces unique
challenges: audio's dense nature requires compression that obscures semantic
meaning, and automatic feature characterization remains limited. We propose a
framework for interpreting audio generative models by mapping their latent
representations to human-interpretable acoustic concepts. We train SAEs on
audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to
discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables
both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process,
revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis. We validate our
approach on continuous (DiffRhythm-VAE) and discrete (EnCodec, WavTokenizer)
audio latent spaces, and analyze DiffRhythm, a state-of-the-art text-to-music
model, to demonstrate how pitch, timbre, and loudness evolve throughout
generation. While our work is only done on audio modality, our framework can be
extended to interpretable analysis of visual latent space generation models.

Conclusion: 重参数化方法能有效提升自适应梯度方法对数据旋转的鲁棒性，恢复其泛化优势。

Abstract: Adaptive gradient methods such as Adam and Adagrad are widely used in machine
learning, yet their effect on the generalization of learned models -- relative
to methods like gradient descent -- remains poorly understood. Prior work on
binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which
can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise
preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to
orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can
manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of
the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and
converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal
decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this
issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which
applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows
any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically
demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision
boundaries.

Abstract: The predictive accuracy of operator learning frameworks depends on the
quality and quantity of available training data (input-output function pairs),
often requiring substantial amounts of high-fidelity data, which can be
challenging to obtain in some real-world engineering applications. These
datasets may be unevenly discretized from one realization to another, with the
grid resolution varying across samples. In this study, we introduce a
physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution
Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup,
addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but
sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent
embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained
basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial
differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer
perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal
coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are
enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation

### [118] [Combining SHAP and Causal Analysis for Interpretable Fault Detection in Industrial Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23817)
*Pedro Cortes dos Santos,Matheus Becali Rocha,Renato A Krohling*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合SHAP和因果分析的故障检测框架，提高了复杂工业数据的检测准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业过程数据复杂且难以检测故障，现有方法在性能和可解释性上存在不足。

Method: 使用SHAP识别关键特征，结合有向无环图进行因果分析。

Result: 方法显著提升了检测准确性，并揭示了故障传播的关键机制。

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂工业环境提供了更智能、可解释的故障检测工具。

Abstract: Industrial processes generate complex data that challenge fault detection
systems, often yielding opaque or underwhelming results despite advanced
machine learning techniques. This study tackles such difficulties using the
Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate
dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts
with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and
interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By
employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a
more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process
features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the
ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by
multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation.
The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings,
consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation
systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only
enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable
insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been
previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive
power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex
manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable
fault detection in industrial systems.

*Yilang Zhang,Xiaodong Yang,Yiwei Cai,Georgios B. Giannakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种通过累积低秩增量逐步形成高秩权重更新的方法，以提升LoRA在大型语言模型微调中的效果和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LoRA在限制权重更新到低维子空间时可能影响效果和收敛速度的问题。

Method: 通过累积连续的低秩增量逐步形成高秩权重更新，并优化低秩矩阵以最小化损失函数。

Result: 在多个任务（自然语言理解、常识推理、数学问题求解）中表现出性能提升和快速收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法在高效优化的同时，显著提升了LoRA的性能和收敛速度。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale in size, the computational
overhead has become a major bottleneck for task-specific fine-tuning. While
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the
weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder
effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these
limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from
consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank
matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full
fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting,
this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the
original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the
optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with
popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent
performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA
variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense
reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.

*Paul Rosu,Muchang Bahng,Erick Jiang,Rico Zhu,Vahid Tarokh*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于物理条件的潜在扩散模型，用于大气数据的高分辨率温度场重建，通过PDE损失增强物理一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型在生成高分辨率温度场时缺乏物理一致性，需通过PDE损失改进。

Method: 在预训练扩散架构基础上，引入PDE损失项，通过有限差分近似强制物理一致性。

Result: 实验表明，PDE损失进一步正则化模型，提升生成场的物理合理性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效结合物理约束与生成模型，代码已开源。

Abstract: This work presents a physics-conditioned latent diffusion model tailored for
dynamical downscaling of atmospheric data, with a focus on reconstructing
high-resolution 2-m temperature fields. Building upon a pre-existing diffusion
architecture and employing a residual formulation against a reference UNet, we
integrate a partial differential equation (PDE) loss term into the model's
training objective. The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel)
space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical
consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective
advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional
diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how
fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and
enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields. The entirety of our
codebase is available on Github, for future reference and development.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GIFT是一种新的强化学习框架，通过最小化隐式和显式奖励模型的差异来对齐LLMs，结合了GRPO、DPO和UNA的关键思想，简化了优化问题并提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如PPO或GRPO直接最大化累积奖励，可能导致训练不稳定或过拟合，GIFT旨在通过隐式和显式奖励对齐来解决这些问题。

Method: GIFT结合了GRPO的多响应生成和归一化、DPO的隐式奖励公式以及UNA的隐式-显式奖励对齐原则，将复杂奖励最大化问题转化为简单的MSE损失。

Result: GIFT在数学基准测试中表现出优越的推理和对齐性能，同时计算效率高，收敛更快且泛化能力更强。

Conclusion: GIFT通过归一化隐式和显式奖励，简化了优化问题，提升了训练稳定性和性能，是一种高效且有效的对齐方法。

Abstract: I propose \textbf{G}roup-relative \textbf{I}mplicit \textbf{F}ine
\textbf{T}uning (GIFT), a novel reinforcement learning framework for aligning
LLMs. Instead of directly maximizing cumulative rewards like PPO or GRPO, GIFT
minimizes the discrepancy between implicit and explicit reward models. It
combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and
normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the
implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the
implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term
that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms
the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error
(MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex
optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable
formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy
and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer
hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly
reduced training overfitting. Empirically, GIFT achieves superior reasoning and
alignment performance on mathematical benchmarks while remaining
computationally efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电动公交车的复杂电气系统使传统维护方法难以捕捉实时数据中的异常，需要更智能的预测方法。

Method: 结合统计过滤和社区检测算法进行特征选择，使用机器学习模型（SVM、随机森林、XGBoost）进行预测，并通过LIME增强可解释性。

Result: 系统能有效预测车辆警报，提升特征可解释性，支持主动维护策略。

Conclusion: 该方法符合工业4.0原则，为电动公交车的预测性维护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive maintenance (PdM) is crucial for optimizing efficiency and
minimizing downtime of electric buses. While these vehicles provide
environmental benefits, they pose challenges for PdM due to complex electric
transmission and battery systems. Traditional maintenance, often based on
scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional
real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection
method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and
investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial
intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent
extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid
graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical
filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with
optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain,
Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and
XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via
SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was
achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The
results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle
alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance
strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RS-ORT是一种用于回归树训练的两阶段优化方法，通过分支定界算法和多种加速技术，解决了大规模连续数据下的计算难题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIP方法在处理连续大规模数据时效率低下或无法保证全局最优性，RS-ORT旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用两阶段优化和分支定界算法，专注于树结构变量，结合多种边界收紧技术（如闭式叶预测、经验阈值离散化等）和并行执行。

Result: 在包含200万样本的数据集上，RS-ORT在4小时内实现了更简单的树结构和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: RS-ORT在训练效率和模型性能上优于现有方法，适用于大规模连续数据。

Abstract: Mixed-integer programming (MIP) has emerged as a powerful framework for
learning optimal decision trees. Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression
tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally
intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing
continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly
deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage
optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees
(RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches
exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the
algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training
samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound
tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold
discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with
decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training.
The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further
alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets.
Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both
binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and
testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up
to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed
training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization
ability in four hours.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注成对因果关系，忽略了变量组之间的相互作用及其集体因果影响。

Method: 使用深度学习建模时间序列组的结构关系，进行组级干预，并通过模型不变性测试推断因果关系。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集（如脑网络和气候生态系统）上表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 组级干预结合不变性测试能有效揭示复杂因果结构，为神经科学和气候科学提供新见解。

Abstract: Causal discovery uncovers complex relationships between variables, enhancing
predictions, decision-making, and insights into real-world systems, especially
in nonlinear multivariate time series. However, most existing methods primarily
focus on pairwise cause-effect relationships, overlooking interactions among
groups of variables, i.e., subsystems and their collective causal influence. In
this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method
that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and
employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach
involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the
structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply
group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model
invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable
groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its
superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared
to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world
datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results
highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models,
combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal
structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and
climate science.

Result: 简化模型验证损失与标准基线相当，参数减少8%。

Conclusion: Query权重冗余性值得在大规模模型中进一步研究。

Abstract: The Query, Key, Value weight triplet is a building block of current attention
mechanisms in state-of-the-art LLMs. We theoretically investigate whether this
triplet can be reduced, proving under simplifying assumptions that the Query
weights are redundant, thereby reducing the number of non-embedding/lm-head
parameters by over 8%. We validate the theory on full-complexity GPT-3 small
architectures (with layer normalization, skip connections, and weight decay)
trained from scratch, demonstrating that the reduced model achieves comparable
validation loss to standard baselines. These findings motivate the
investigation of the Query weight redundancy at scale.

Result: 在唯一且遍历最优策略下，值迭代算法具有几何收敛速率。

Conclusion: 通过几何解释统一了MDP的两种奖励分析，并扩展了值迭代算法的收敛性结果。

Abstract: The theoretical analysis of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) is commonly
split into two cases - the average-reward case and the discounted-reward case -
which, while sharing similarities, are typically analyzed separately. In this
work, we extend a recently introduced geometric interpretation of MDPs for the
discounted-reward case to the average-reward case, thereby unifying both. This
allows us to extend a major result known for the discounted-reward case to the
average-reward case: under a unique and ergodic optimal policy, the Value
Iteration algorithm achieves a geometric convergence rate.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络训练中，STE提供有偏梯度，ZO梯度无偏但计算昂贵，需要一种折中方法。

Method: 提出FOGZO方法，结合STE的高质量有偏梯度和ZO的无偏性，减少计算成本。

Result: 在多个模型上验证，FOGZO在相同迭代次数下提升1-8%准确率，计算成本显著降低。

Conclusion: FOGZO在量化训练中有效平衡了梯度质量和计算效率，适用于多种模型。

Abstract: We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters.
Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of
gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While
the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works
have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We
note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are
unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order
Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations
relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff
between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training.
Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\%
accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\% accuracy improvement on ResNet
18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3
billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\times$ reduction in
computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at

Motivation: 联邦学习中的梯度泄漏攻击可能泄露敏感数据，需要评估差分隐私机制的实际防御效果。

Method: 在模拟联邦学习环境中，评估不同隐私级别下计算机视觉模型的性能，并分析梯度泄漏攻击的数据重建质量。

Result: DP-SGD显著降低梯度泄漏风险但牺牲模型性能，PDP-SGD保持性能但防御效果不佳。

Conclusion: 需实证评估隐私机制的实际效果，尤其在分布式学习中，信息泄漏可能对数据安全构成严重威胁。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows for the training of Machine Learning models in
a collaborative manner without the need to share sensitive data. However, it
remains vulnerable to Gradient Leakage Attacks (GLAs), which can reveal private
information from the shared model updates. In this work, we investigate the
effectiveness of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms - specifically, DP-SGD
and a variant based on explicit regularization (PDP-SGD) - as defenses against
GLAs. To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision
models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task,
and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the
intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate
that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks,
albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD
maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a
practical defense against reconstruction attacks. These findings highlight the
importance of empirically evaluating privacy mechanisms beyond their
theoretical guarantees, particularly in distributed learning scenarios where
information leakage may represent an unassumable critical threat to data
security and privacy.

Motivation: 高维流体模型（如Navier-Stokes方程）的集合模拟计算成本高，现有神经网络算子依赖数据且泛化能力差。

Method: 采用基于物理的架构，直接利用初始和边界条件以及外力函数生成解，无需配对数据。

Result: 在2D和3D测试中，该方法在精度和效率上均优于现有方法，首次实现了3D Navier-Stokes方程的无数据求解。

Conclusion: 结合数值架构和机器学习可扩展性，为无数据高保真PDE替代模型提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Ensemble simulations of high-dimensional flow models (e.g., Navier Stokes
type PDEs) are computationally prohibitive for real time applications. Neural
operators enable fast inference but are limited by costly data requirements and
poor generalization to 3D flows. We present a data-free operator network for
the Navier Stokes equations that eliminates the need for paired solution data
and enables robust, real time inference for large ensemble forecasting. The
physics-grounded architecture takes initial and boundary conditions as well as
forcing functions, yielding solutions robust to high variability and
perturbations. Across 2D benchmarks and 3D test cases, the method surpasses
prior neural operators in accuracy and, for ensembles, achieves greater
efficiency than conventional numerical solvers. Notably, it delivers accurate
solutions of the three dimensional Navier Stokes equations, a regime not
previously demonstrated for data free neural operators. By uniting a
numerically grounded architecture with the scalability of machine learning,
this approach establishes a practical pathway toward data free, high fidelity
PDE surrogates for end to end scientific simulation and prediction.

Motivation: 现有的LLM象棋能力评估缺乏系统性和广度，难以准确衡量模型的理解能力及其随规模、训练方法或架构选择的变化。

Method: ChessQA通过五个任务类别（结构、模式、短战术、位置判断和语义）评估LLM的象棋理解能力，对应玩家逐步掌握的抽象层次。

Result: 评估显示当代LLM在所有五个类别中均存在持续弱点，并提供了详细的错误分析。

Conclusion: ChessQA提供了一个动态、全面的基准测试，支持未来研究，并计划发布代码、数据集和公开排行榜。

Abstract: Chess provides an ideal testbed for evaluating the reasoning, modeling, and
abstraction capabilities of large language models (LLMs), as it has
well-defined structure and objective ground truth while admitting a wide
spectrum of skill levels. However, existing evaluations of LLM ability in chess
are ad hoc and narrow in scope, making it difficult to accurately measure LLM
chess understanding and how it varies with scale, post-training methodologies,
or architecture choices. We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that
assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural,
Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately
correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate
chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to
correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically
describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more
comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly
beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a
controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore,
ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction
scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary
LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide
results and error analyses by category. We will release the code, periodically
refreshed datasets, and a public leaderboard to support further research.

Motivation: 为了在训练实践或模型架构变化中保持CoT的可监控性，需要量化其可读性和覆盖性。

Method: 使用自动评分提示（autorater prompt）让LLM评估现有CoT的可读性和覆盖性，并在前沿模型上验证。

Result: 前沿模型在挑战性基准测试中表现出高可监控性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发者提供了一种工具，用于跟踪设计决策对可监控性的影响，但需与对抗性测试互补。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) monitoring offers a unique opportunity for AI
safety, this opportunity could be lost through shifts in training practices or
model architecture. To help preserve monitorability, we propose a pragmatic way
to measure two components of it: legibility (whether the reasoning can be
followed by a human) and coverage (whether the CoT contains all the reasoning
needed for a human to also produce the final output). We implement these
metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the
legibility and coverage of existing CoTs. After sanity-checking our prompted
autorater with synthetic CoT degradations, we apply it to several frontier
models on challenging benchmarks, finding that they exhibit high
monitorability. We present these metrics, including our complete autorater
prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact
monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version
under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in
the community will find it useful. Our method helps measure the default
monitorability of CoT - it should be seen as a complement, not a replacement,
for the adversarial stress-testing needed to test robustness against
deliberately evasive models.

limiting their adaptability to the generative process. We propose Diffusion
Adaptive Text Embedding (DATE), which dynamically updates text embeddings at
each diffusion timestep based on intermediate perturbed data. We formulate an
optimization problem and derive an update rule that refines the text embeddings
at each sampling step to improve alignment and preference between the mean
predicted image and the text. This allows DATE to dynamically adapts the text
conditions to the reverse-diffused images throughout diffusion sampling without
requiring additional model training. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
results, we show that DATE maintains the generative capability of the model
while providing superior text-image alignment over fixed text embeddings across
various tasks, including multi-concept generation and text-guided image
editing. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/DATE.

TL;DR: SynCast是一种高分辨率神经预测模型，结合气象和空气成分数据，显著提高了对平均和极端污染水平的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空气污染是全球健康和环境的主要风险，现有模型常低估罕见但危险的污染事件，需要更准确的预测方法。

Method: 基于区域适应的Transformer架构，结合扩散随机细化模块，利用ERA5和CAMS数据集，通过领域感知目标和极值理论优化模型。

Result: SynCast在多种PM变量（PM1、PM2.5、PM10）的预测中表现优异，尤其在极端条件下显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SynCast为下一代空气质量预警系统提供了可扩展的基础，支持脆弱地区的气候健康风险缓解。

Abstract: Air pollution remains a leading global health and environmental risk,
particularly in regions vulnerable to episodic air pollution spikes due to
wildfires, urban haze and dust storms. Accurate forecasting of particulate
matter (PM) concentrations is essential to enable timely public health warnings
and interventions, yet existing models often underestimate rare but hazardous
pollution events. Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural
forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to
improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a
regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based
stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving
PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized
ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting
fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$),
especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss
functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show
that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory,
significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without
compromising global accuracy. This approach provides a scalable foundation for
next-generation air quality early warning systems and supports climate-health
risk mitigation in vulnerable regions.

expect outstanding energy performance of \hdgc on neuromorphic and emerging
process-in-memory devices.

Motivation: 高维算子特征值问题受维度灾难影响，现有深度学习方法性能依赖算子谱分布。

Result: 实验表明STNet在精度上优于现有方法，达到最优性能。

Conclusion: STNet通过谱变换有效提升求解效率，适用于复杂算子特征值问题。

Abstract: Operator eigenvalue problems play a critical role in various scientific
fields and engineering applications, yet numerical methods are hindered by the
curse of dimensionality. Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient
approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks.
These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the
given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve
precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral
distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we
propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration,
STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral
transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but
easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the
subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the
search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally,
our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses
those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.

Motivation: 组合老虎机在在线推荐和品类优化中有广泛应用，但现有方法（如UCB）缺乏显式探索可能导致失败。

Result: 在组合多臂老虎机和组合线性上下文老虎机中均实现近最优遗憾，且提供匹配下界。

Conclusion: 新算法优于UCB方法，解决了显式探索不足的问题。

Abstract: Combinatorial bandits extend the classical bandit framework to settings where
the learner selects multiple arms in each round, motivated by applications such
as online recommendation and assortment optimization. While extensions of upper
confidence bound (UCB) algorithms arise naturally in this context, adapting arm
elimination methods has proved more challenging. We introduce a novel
elimination scheme that partitions arms into three categories (confirmed,
active, and eliminated), and incorporates explicit exploration to update these
sets. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm in two settings: the
combinatorial multi-armed bandit with general graph feedback, and the
combinatorial linear contextual bandit. In both cases, our approach achieves
near-optimal regret, whereas UCB-based methods can provably fail due to
insufficient explicit exploration. Matching lower bounds are also provided.

Conclusion: 方法可扩展，适用于海事领域，未来将探索模型在其他河流的适用性。

Abstract: Accurate, real-time estimation of barge quantity on inland waterways remains
a critical challenge due to the non-self-propelled nature of barges and the
limitations of existing monitoring systems. This study introduces a novel
method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to
predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and
test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes
across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel
tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30
AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and
trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature
Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression
models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches,
were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best
performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of
the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics
capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and
trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides
a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain
Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port
management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept
presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with
differing operational and environmental conditions.

Conclusion: STG有效提升模型安全性，且无需额外训练，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Text-to-image models have recently made significant advances in generating
realistic and semantically coherent images, driven by advanced diffusion models
and large-scale web-crawled datasets. However, these datasets often contain
inappropriate or biased content, raising concerns about the generation of
harmful outputs when provided with malicious text prompts. We propose Safe Text
embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of
diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts
the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final
denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional
training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model
distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while
minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety
scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG
consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in
removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input
prompts. Our code is available at https://github.com/aailab-kaist/STG.

Abstract: Understanding the evolution of brain functional networks over time is of
great significance for the analysis of cognitive mechanisms and the diagnosis
of neurological diseases. Existing methods often have difficulty in capturing
the temporal evolution characteristics of connections between specific
functional communities. To this end, this paper proposes a new path-level
trajectory modeling framework (NeuroPathNet) to characterize the dynamic
behavior of connection pathways between brain functional partitions. Based on
medically supported static partitioning schemes (such as Yeo and Smith ICA), we
extract the time series of connection strengths between each pair of functional
partitions and model them using a temporal neural network. We validate the
model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI)
datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods
in multiple indicators. This study can promote the development of dynamic graph
learning methods for brain network analysis, and provide possible clinical
applications for the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种全局-局部融合（GLF）采样策略，结合全局和局部采样的优势，通过残差自适应采样和残差近似提升PINNs的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs的精度依赖于配置点的放置，全局采样稳定但计算昂贵，局部采样高效但可能忽略已学习区域。

Method: GLF策略通过高斯噪声扰动训练点，集中采样于困难区域，并引入轻量级线性代理近似全局残差分布。

Result: 在基准PDE上的实验表明，GLF在准确性和效率上均优于全局和局部采样策略。

Conclusion: GLF为提升PINNs在复杂和高维PDE中的可靠性和效率提供了实用且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: The accuracy of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) critically depends
on the placement of collocation points, as the PDE loss is approximated through
sampling over the solution domain. Global sampling ensures stability by
covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally
expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on
high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness.
We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the
strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are
generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to
the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while
preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight
linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based
distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost.
Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based
approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the
efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs
demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency
compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a
practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency
of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.

Result: 在五个真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在准确性和效率上均显著优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 联合变量选择和模型优化是提升STMF性能的有效途径。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series
of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast
their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in
spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air
pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of
missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications
where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to
be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art
assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model
input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$
variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by
studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects
$m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast
accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable
selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model
efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked
variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative
variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2)
prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to
preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation
mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input
to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency
information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work
significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and
model optimization.

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Combinatorial Optimization (CO) is an
emerging paradigm for solving combinatorial problems using neural networks. In
this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with
discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that
enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural
networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on
convex geometry and Carath\'eodory's theorem to decompose neural network
outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to
feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised
training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural
net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in
cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently
outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our
method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set
of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in
graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.

Conclusion: 该框架为异常检测提供了强大工具，强调了多阶段架构的重要性。

Abstract: This paper presents Two-Stage LKPLO, a novel multi-stage outlier detection
framework that overcomes the coexisting limitations of conventional
projection-based methods: their reliance on a fixed statistical metric and
their assumption of a single data structure. Our framework uniquely synthesizes
three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO)
that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our
proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear
data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle
multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on
10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate
that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly
outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where
existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and
complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study
empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization
and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance. This
work contributes a powerful new tool for a significant class of outlier
detection problems and underscores the importance of hybrid, multi-stage
architectures.

Result: 实验证明RED能有效减少负迁移，并达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RED通过因果解耦和环境分歧减少，显著提升了无监督域适应的效果。

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation~(UDA) focuses on transferring knowledge from a
labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, addressing the challenge
of \emph{domain shift}. Significant domain shifts hinder effective knowledge
transfer, leading to \emph{negative transfer} and deteriorating model
performance. Therefore, mitigating negative transfer is essential. This study
revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning,
emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal
environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals
that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment
evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \emph{environmental
disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we
propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each
sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal
environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental
feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and
reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal
environmental features. Experimental results confirm that RED effectively
mitigates negative transfer and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: The utility of tabular data for tasks ranging from model training to
large-scale data analysis is often constrained by privacy concerns or
regulatory hurdles. While existing data generation methods, particularly those
based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise, they
frequently struggle with capturing complex causal relationship, maintaining
data utility, and providing provable privacy guarantees suitable for enterprise
deployment. We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically
engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets. CA-GAN
utilizes a two-step approach: causal graph extraction to learn a robust,
comprehensive causal relationship in the data's manifold, followed by a custom
Conditional WGAN-GP (Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty) that operates
exclusively as per the structure of nodes in the causal graph. More
importantly, the generator is trained with a new Reinforcement Learning-based
objective that aligns the causal graphs constructed from real and fake data,
ensuring the causal awareness in both training and sampling phases. We
demonstrate CA-GAN superiority over six SOTA methods across 14 tabular
datasets. Our evaluations, focused on core data engineering metrics: causal
preservation, utility preservation, and privacy preservation. Our method offers
a practical, high-performance solution for data engineers seeking to create
high-quality, privacy-compliant synthetic datasets to benchmark database
systems, accelerate software development, and facilitate secure data-driven
research.

Conclusion: RAP通过结合参数化和非参数化方法，有效抑制了长期预测中的误差发散，提升了预测的物理真实性。

Abstract: Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems
remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning
models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success,
they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during
long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible
artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which
struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To
address this, we introduce a novel \textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction
(RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of
deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy
of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric
estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently
retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The
true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \textbf{reference
target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function
but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream
architecture. It provides strong \textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the
model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive
benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only
surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong
\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates
predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error
divergence in long-term rollouts.

Motivation: 传统蛋白质优化方法成本高，现有ALDE方法因选择同质性突变体导致预测模型不准确。

Method: FolDE结合蛋白质语言模型输出和活性测量进行预热，并采用多样化批次选择策略。

Result: 在20个蛋白质目标模拟中，FolDE比最佳基线方法多发现23%的前10%突变体，且找到前1%突变体的概率高55%。

Conclusion: FolDE通过开源软件提供高效蛋白质优化方案，适用于任何实验室。

Abstract: Proteins are traditionally optimized through the costly construction and
measurement of many mutants. Active Learning-assisted Directed Evolution (ALDE)
alleviates that cost by predicting the best improvements and iteratively
testing mutants to inform predictions. However, existing ALDE methods face a
critical limitation: selecting the highest-predicted mutants in each round
yields homogeneous training data insufficient for accurate prediction models in
subsequent rounds. Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize
end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE
discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005)
and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily
through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity
measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity
prediction. We also introduce a constant-liar batch selector, which improves
batch diversity; this is important in multi-mutation campaigns but had limited
effect in our benchmarks. The complete workflow is freely available as
open-source software, making efficient protein optimization accessible to any
laboratory.

TL;DR: FALQON框架通过直接合并LoRA适配器到FP8量化主干中，显著减少了量化开销，实现了3倍训练加速，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FP8量化在大维度矩阵乘法中有效，但在LoRA等小维度矩阵应用中量化开销限制了速度提升。

Method: 提出FALQON框架，合并LoRA适配器到FP8主干，优化前向和反向计算，并引入行级代理更新机制。

Result: 实验显示FALQON比现有量化LoRA方法快3倍，准确性相当。

Conclusion: FALQON为大规模模型高效微调提供了实用解决方案，并简化了部署流程。

Abstract: Low-bit floating-point (FP) formats, such as FP8, provide significant
acceleration and memory savings in model training thanks to native hardware
support on modern GPUs and NPUs. However, we analyze that FP8 quantization
offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while
inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank
adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we
propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead
from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into
an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the
forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce
quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that
efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone.
Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a
3$\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar
level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale
model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need
for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL在VLMs中的有效性，填补现有研究空白，并分析影响多模态ICL的关键因素。

Method: 评估七种不同架构的VLMs在三个图像描述基准上的表现，分析提示设计、架构选择和训练策略的影响，并首次研究注意力模式随演示示例数量的变化。

Result: 训练于图像-文本交错数据提升ICL性能，但未有效整合视觉和文本信息；指令调优可能减少对上下文示例的依赖。注意力分析显示VLMs主要依赖文本线索。

Conclusion: 当前VLMs在多模态ICL中存在局限性，需改进视觉信息整合能力，以提升从多模态示例中学习的能力。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn tasks
from demonstration examples without parameter updates. Although it has been
extensively studied in LLMs, its effectiveness in Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic study of ICL in
VLMs, evaluating seven models spanning four architectures on three image
captioning benchmarks. We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and
training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the
first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number
of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text
interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective
integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In
contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce
reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between
instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further
show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage
visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration.
These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs
and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal
in-context examples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为离散扩散模型提供理论支持，证明常用损失函数（如DSE和DCE）不仅是变分界，而且是紧致的对数似然估计器。

Method: 引入I-MDSE和I-MDCE关系，将互信息与去噪得分熵损失和交叉熵损失联系起来。

Result: 实验验证了估计器的准确性、方差稳定性和实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架为离散扩散模型提供了理论依据，并支持多种实际扩展。

Abstract: We present an information-theoretic framework for discrete diffusion models
that yields principled estimators of log-likelihood using score-matching
losses. Inspired by the I-MMSE identity for the Gaussian setup, we derive
analogous results for the discrete setting. Specifically, we introduce the
Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links
mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum
denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion
and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE)
relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete
masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the
log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that
commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but
tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition
further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional
likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo
estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data
confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The
code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.

TL;DR: 论文研究了联邦学习中数据异构性导致的客户端漂移问题，提出了一种改进的FedAvg方法（FLIU），并通过实验验证了其性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中因数据异构性导致的客户端漂移问题，同时兼顾模型的本地性能和泛化能力。

Method: 提出FLIU方法，在FedAvg基础上引入自适应个性化因子，并在不同数据分布条件下进行实验评估。

Result: FLIU在MNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上表现出色，尤其在复杂异构数据环境中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: FLIU通过个性化更新有效缓解了客户端漂移问题，同时保持了模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments,
local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local
training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of
these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global
model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for
most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge
by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on
their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples,
which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component
of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and
evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated
Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their
generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a
single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the
considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach
of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU),
extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an
adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches
empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions,
including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel
test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress
the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.

Motivation: 解决Graph-based RAG在多领域（如生物医学、法律）中因频繁LLM调用导致的高成本问题。

Method: 提出G2ConS，包含块选择方法和独立于LLM的概念图，减少知识图谱构建成本。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，G2ConS在成本、检索效果和回答质量上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: G2ConS有效降低了知识图谱构建成本，同时提升了检索和回答质量。

Abstract: Graph-based RAG constructs a knowledge graph (KG) from text chunks to enhance
retrieval in Large Language Model (LLM)-based question answering. It is
especially beneficial in domains such as biomedicine, law, and political
science, where effective retrieval often involves multi-hop reasoning over
proprietary documents. However, these methods demand numerous LLM calls to
extract entities and relations from text chunks, incurring prohibitive costs at
scale. Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain
words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important.
Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its
core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph.
The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the
latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.
Evaluations on multiple real-world datasets show that G2ConS outperforms all
baselines in construction cost, retrieval effectiveness, and answering quality.

Method: 使用具有准线性激活函数的因果CNN，并分析其卷积核长度对频谱特征捕获的影响。

Result: 因果CNN可以隐式和显式地捕获频谱特征，且整个网络可简化为类似FIR滤波器的单层结构。

Conclusion: 因果CNN在稀疏频率内容的信号学习中表现出与FIR滤波器的等效性，适用于动态系统的建模和识别。

Abstract: This study investigates the behavior of Causal Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) with quasi-linear activation functions when applied to time-series data
characterized by multimodal frequency content. We demonstrate that, once
trained, such networks exhibit properties analogous to Finite Impulse Response
(FIR) filters, particularly when the convolutional kernels are of extended
length exceeding those typically employed in standard CNN architectures. Causal
CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly,
offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems.
Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the
entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling
an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new
insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with
sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam
dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance
for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.

Motivation: 电动汽车的快速发展对锂离子电池的准确高效诊断提出了更高需求，传统方法存在计算成本高、收敛慢或依赖恒定电流数据的局限性。

Method: 结合神经代理模型（NeuralSPMe）和深度学习固定点迭代方法（PUNet），利用动态负载数据进行训练和参数更新。

Result: 实验表明，该框架将参数识别速度提升2000倍以上，样本效率和准确性分别显著优于传统元启发式算法。

Conclusion: 该框架在动态负载场景下表现出色，为实际应用中的电池健康评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of electric vehicles has intensified the need for
accurate and efficient diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries. Parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a
powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional
metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow
convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance
on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome
these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter
identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework
combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte
(NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe
is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium
concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter
update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly
reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations
required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the
proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000
times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher
accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under
dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.

Motivation: 复杂耗散系统在科学和工程中广泛存在，但远离平衡态时，能量耗散和时间不可逆性难以量化，学习准确且可解释的模型是一大挑战。

Method: I-OnsagerNet扩展了Onsager原理，确保学习到的势能从稳态密度中获得，并将漂移分解为时间可逆和不可逆部分。

Result: 该方法能计算熵产生并量化不可逆性，应用于聚合物拉伸和随机梯度Langevin动力学，揭示了新的物理现象。

Conclusion: I-OnsagerNet为发现和解释非平衡动力学提供了一个通用的数据驱动框架。

Abstract: Complex dissipative systems appear across science and engineering, from
polymers and active matter to learning algorithms. These systems operate far
from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to
their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and
interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models
must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough
to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we
introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic
dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and
uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the
learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift
decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as
dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate
the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled
way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer
stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics
reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and
sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the
suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus
establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting
non-equilibrium dynamics.

Abstract: Computationally resolving turbulence remains a central challenge in fluid
dynamics due to its multi-scale interactions. Fully resolving large-scale
turbulence through direct numerical simulation (DNS) is computationally
prohibitive, motivating data-driven machine learning alternatives. In this
work, we propose EddyFormer, a Transformer-based spectral-element (SEM)
architecture for large-scale turbulence simulation that combines the accuracy
of spectral methods with the scalability of the attention mechanism. We
introduce an SEM tokenization that decomposes the flow into grid-scale and
subgrid-scale components, enabling capture of both local and global features.
We create a new three-dimensional isotropic turbulence dataset and train
EddyFormer to achieves DNS-level accuracy at 256^3 resolution, providing a 30x
speedup over DNS. When applied to unseen domains up to 4x larger than in
training, EddyFormer preserves accuracy on physics-invariant metrics-energy
spectra, correlation functions, and structure functions-showing domain
generalization. On The Well benchmark suite of diverse turbulent flows,
EddyFormer resolves cases where prior ML models fail to converge, accurately
reproducing complex dynamics across a wide range of physical conditions.

Abstract: The surge of audiovisual content on streaming platforms and social media has
heightened the demand for accurate and accessible subtitles. However, existing
subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based
extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization,
incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading
speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current
approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a
labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT
(Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically
detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining
Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing,
and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from
both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced
from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of
~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality
results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle
annotation.

<details>

Motivation: 联邦学习虽然保护了数据隐私，但梯度反转攻击（如 SPEAR）的指数级运行时限制了其实际应用。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用稀疏字典学习技术，改进 SPEAR 攻击，使其在批量大小上具有线性运行时。

Result: SPEAR++ 在保持 SPEAR 优点的同时，适用于 10 倍更大的批量，且对 DP 噪声和 FedAvg 聚合具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SPEAR++ 是 SPEAR 的实用化改进，为联邦学习的隐私保护提供了更高效的评估工具。

Abstract: Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios
recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models
without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction
of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its
privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on
direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of
real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new
federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was
introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear
layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical
breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential
runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying
State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the
problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable.
Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable
properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation,
while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.

Abstract: In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by
high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with
data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental
limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation
plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate
physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state
dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling
the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled
interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these
augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced
Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data
distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive
experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging
out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of
our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.

Conclusion: 希望为临床预测模型的进一步开发提供比较基础，推动更多模型应用于临床实践。

Abstract: As more Intensive Care Unit (ICU) data becomes available, the interest in
developing clinical prediction models to improve healthcare protocols
increases. However, the lack of data quality still hinders clinical prediction
using Machine Learning (ML). Many vital sign measurements, such as heart rate,
contain sizeable missing segments, leaving gaps in the data that could
negatively impact prediction performance. Previous works have introduced
numerous time-series imputation techniques. Nevertheless, more comprehensive
work is needed to compare a representative set of methods for imputing ICU
vital signs and determine the best practice. In reality, ad-hoc imputation
techniques that could decrease prediction accuracy, like zero imputation, are
still used. In this work, we compare established imputation techniques to guide
researchers in improving the performance of clinical prediction models by
selecting the most accurate imputation technique. We introduce an extensible
and reusable benchmark with currently 15 imputation and 4 amputation methods,
created for benchmarking on major ICU datasets. We hope to provide a
comparative basis and facilitate further ML development to bring more models
into clinical practice.

Result: PRIVET能可靠检测记忆化和隐私泄漏，适用于高维数据和小样本场景，并在定性和定量评估中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PRIVET填补了样本级隐私评估的空白，为合成数据的实际部署提供了更全面的隐私保护工具。

Abstract: Deep generative models are often trained on sensitive data, such as genetic
sequences, health data, or more broadly, any copyrighted, licensed or protected
content. This raises critical concerns around privacy-preserving synthetic
data, and more specifically around privacy leakage, an issue closely tied to
overfitting. Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to
estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only
quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation
methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical
deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value
statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic
sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy
leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET
reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse
data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited
sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We
compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show
its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments
through qualitative and quantitative outputs. Additionally, our analysis
reveals limitations in existing computer vision embeddings to yield
perceptually meaningful distances when identifying near-duplicate samples.

Result: SOIDS首次在两种极端情况下均实现最优最坏情况遗憾，并通过实验验证了其良好性能。

Conclusion: SOIDS为稀疏线性赌博机问题提供了首个无需贝叶斯假设即可适应两种极端情况的算法，具有理论和实践意义。

Abstract: Many high-dimensional online decision-making problems can be modeled as
stochastic sparse linear bandits. Most existing algorithms are designed to
achieve optimal worst-case regret in either the data-rich regime, where
polynomial depen- dence on the ambient dimension is unavoidable, or the
data-poor regime, where dimension-independence is possible at the cost of worse
dependence on the num- ber of rounds. In contrast, the sparse Information
Directed Sampling (IDS) algo- rithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has
the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the
use of Sparse Optimistic Informa- tion Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the
same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions.
Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning
rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret. Our
results extend the theoretical guarantees of IDS, pro- viding the first
algorithm that simultaneously achieves optimal worst-case regret in both the
data-rich and data-poor regimes. We empirically demonstrate the good
performance of SOIDS.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaTaRM提出了一种结合偏好感知和任务自适应奖励机制的框架，显著提升了奖励模型的性能和下游RLHF效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统奖励模型在RLHF中存在二元标签不匹配和点标注成本高的问题，PaTaRM旨在解决这些局限性。

Method: PaTaRM通过相对偏好数据构建点式训练信号，并动态生成评估标准，无需显式点标注。

Result: 实验显示PaTaRM在RewardBench和RMBench上平均提升4.7%，下游RLHF任务提升13.6%。

Conclusion: PaTaRM是一种高效、通用且可解释的奖励建模方法，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language
models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs)
offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training
paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad
labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex
pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand,
point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven
criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this
work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a
unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism
with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference
information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals,
eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs
a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for
both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This
design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for
RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative
improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B
models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average
improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its
effectiveness and robustness. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于规则的TLogic框架扩展方法，结合实体类别信息以提高预测准确性和可解释性，并利用LLM生成未知类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于嵌入的方法缺乏可解释性，限制了用户对预测结果的理解和评估。

Result: 新方法在保持高准确性的同时提供了可解释的预测结果。

Conclusion: 结合规则和实体类别的方法在时间知识图谱预测中实现了透明且准确的预测。

Abstract: Temporal Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a powerful way of not only modeling
static relationships between entities but also the dynamics of how relations
evolve over time. As these informational structures can be used to store
information from a real-world setting, such as a news flow, predicting future
graph components to a certain extent equates predicting real-world events. Most
of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often
leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black
boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an
established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in
combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows
the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the
prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key
component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant
entities. When categories are unknown for building the graph, we propose a
data-driven method to generate them with an LLM-based approach. Additionally,
we investigate the choice of aggregation method for scores of retrieved
entities when performing category prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SALS框架通过低秩投影和稀疏标记选择，有效压缩KV缓存并提升推理速度，同时保持高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法因RoPE机制导致精度下降或速度瓶颈，需解决这一问题。

Method: 提出SALS框架，将KV缓存投影到紧凑潜在空间，并在该空间进行稀疏标记选择。

Result: SALS在多种任务中实现6.4倍KV缓存压缩和5.7倍注意力加速，端到端吞吐量显著提升。

Conclusion: SALS在保持精度的同时显著提升推理效率，适用于大规模模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high
demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value
cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has
demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden
dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to
the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive
low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed
bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply
RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of
RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a
higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent
space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on
these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS
projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and
performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this
space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the
overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on
various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and
additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA
performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS
achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention
operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end
throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared
to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.

Motivation: 方程发现技术在回归任务中表现出色，但在分类任务中的应用较少。本文旨在扩展ED技术到二元分类领域，发现简洁且可解释的模型。

Method: 提出EDC框架，使用包含线性、二次、指数和特征乘积项的语法，生成灵活的决策边界。

Result: EDC在人工和真实数据实验中，能够发现目标方程的结构和参数，性能优于现有ED分类方法。

Conclusion: EDC展示了在二元分类中的潜力，其语法设计灵活且可配置，适合特定领域需求。

Abstract: Equation Discovery techniques have shown considerable success in regression
tasks, where they are used to discover concise and interpretable models
(\textit{Symbolic Regression}). In this paper, we propose a new ED-based binary
classification framework. Our proposed method EDC finds analytical functions of
manageable size that specify the location and shape of the decision boundary.
In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how
EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as
the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art
ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving
performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We
suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested
datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the
models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be
included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar
consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear,
quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing
hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments
demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while
not so rich to cause overfitting.

Motivation: 贝叶斯聚类虽能处理不确定性，但计算量大且对缺失值处理不足。

Method: 利用合成数据集训练Cluster-PFN，学习估计聚类数量和分配的后验分布。

Result: 在聚类数量和聚类质量上优于传统方法，且速度更快，能处理高缺失率数据。

Conclusion: Cluster-PFN提供了可扩展且灵活的贝叶斯聚类解决方案。

Abstract: Bayesian clustering accounts for uncertainty but is computationally demanding
at scale. Furthermore, real-world datasets often contain missing values, and
simple imputation ignores the associated uncertainty, resulting in suboptimal
results. We present Cluster-PFN, a Transformer-based model that extends
Prior-Data Fitted Networks (PFNs) to unsupervised Bayesian clustering. Trained
entirely on synthetic datasets generated from a finite Gaussian Mixture Model
(GMM) prior, Cluster-PFN learns to estimate the posterior distribution over
both the number of clusters and the cluster assignments. Our method estimates
the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection
procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves
clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.
Cluster-PFN can be trained on complex priors that include missing data,
outperforming imputation-based baselines on real-world genomic datasets, at
high missingness. These results show that the Cluster-PFN can provide scalable
and flexible Bayesian clustering.

Motivation: 传统方法中感知与决策耦合，可能导致感知质量受限于特定任务。PeL 旨在独立优化感知接口，提升其通用性和鲁棒性。

Method: PeL 通过任务无关信号优化感知接口 $f_\phi$，定义感知属性（如稳定性、信息性等），并使用表示不变性指标评估。

Result: 证明了 PeL 更新与贝叶斯任务风险梯度正交，并提供了一套任务无关的评估指标来验证感知质量。

Conclusion: PeL 提供了一种分离感知与决策的有效方法，能够独立提升感知接口的质量，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: We introduce Perception Learning (PeL), a paradigm that optimizes an agent's
sensory interface $f_\phi:\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Z}$ using task-agnostic
signals, decoupled from downstream decision learning
$g_\theta:\mathcal{Z}\to\mathcal{Y}$. PeL directly targets label-free
perceptual properties, such as stability to nuisances, informativeness without
collapse, and controlled geometry, assessed via objective
representation-invariant metrics. We formalize the separation of perception and
decision, define perceptual properties independent of objectives or
reparameterizations, and prove that PeL updates preserving sufficient
invariants are orthogonal to Bayes task-risk gradients. Additionally, we
provide a suite of task-agnostic evaluation metrics to certify perceptual
quality.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据的两步法，通过提升数据质量和过滤低置信度预测来增强机器学习模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在高风险领域（如医疗）中可靠性至关重要，但现有模型常忽略不确定性，导致低置信度预测。

Method: 1. 使用实例硬度（IH）过滤训练数据中的问题实例；2. 在推理阶段引入基于置信度的拒绝机制。

Result: 在三个真实医疗数据集上验证，该方法显著提升模型可靠性，同时平衡预测性能和拒绝率。

Conclusion: 该方法为安全关键领域的机器学习系统提供了一种实用部署方案。

Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) models are widely used in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare, where the reliability of predictions is critical. However, these
models often fail to account for uncertainty, providing predictions even with
low confidence. This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to
enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering
low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance
Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining
the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism
during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We
evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating
its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive
performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria -
influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to
evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that
integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances
model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances. This
approach provides a practical method for deploying ML systems in
safety-critical applications.

Motivation: 解决合成数据在公共交通研究中评估不足的问题，现有评估方法零散且不全面。

Method: 提出RPU框架，从代表性、隐私和实用性三个维度及三个层次（记录、组、群体）系统评估合成数据。

Result: 合成数据不天然保证隐私，CTGAN在权衡隐私与代表性/实用性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: RPU框架为研究者提供了系统评估合成数据的方法，CTGAN适合实际应用。

Abstract: Synthetic data offers a promising solution to the privacy and accessibility
challenges of using smart card data in public transport research. Despite rapid
progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive
evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly
are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to
population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without
considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this
gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that
systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary
dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The
framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity,
disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced
assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark
twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical
models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show
that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no
"one-size-fits-all" model, the trade-off between privacy and
representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative
adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is
suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic
and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic
data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport
applications.

Motivation: 现有虚拟筛选方法在大型CSL（如数十亿化合物）中仅能评估极少部分，导致潜在高评分化合物未被发现，且缺乏灵活性。

Result: APEX在检索精度和运行时间上均优于其他方法，适用于多目标和约束的动态变化场景。

Conclusion: APEX为大规模CSL的虚拟筛选提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，显著提升了药物发现的效率。

Abstract: Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL
have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size
presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the
top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g.,
optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited
computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of
billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual
screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available
compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered.
Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course
of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms
typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the
approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a
neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction
of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU
possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$
sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised
of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their
docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical
properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of
constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared
against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's
consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared
to alternative methods.

Conclusion: 离线到在线的混合范式有效解决了稀疏奖励环境中的学习效率问题。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in sparse-reward environments remains a
significant challenge due to the lack of informative feedback. We propose a
simple yet effective method that uses a small number of successful
demonstrations to initialize the value function of an RL agent. By precomputing
value estimates from offline demonstrations and using them as targets for early
learning, our approach provides the agent with a useful prior over promising
actions. The agent then refines these estimates through standard online
interaction. This hybrid offline-to-online paradigm significantly reduces the
exploration burden and improves sample efficiency in sparse-reward settings.
Experiments on benchmark tasks demonstrate that our method accelerates
convergence and outperforms standard baselines, even with minimal or suboptimal
demonstration data.

Motivation: 现有LoRA初始化方法未充分利用目标域数据或依赖浅层梯度分解，性能不足且缺乏理论基础。

Method: 通过最小化微调与目标模型参数差异的期望，推导出包含偏置项和方差项的优化问题，提出LoRA-DA算法。

Result: 实验表明LoRA-DA在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，收敛更快、更稳定，且对秩变化鲁棒。

Conclusion: LoRA-DA为数据感知的LoRA初始化提供了理论支持，显著提升了性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for
PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention.
However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not
incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only
at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains
unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step
fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these
methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on
restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical
framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis.
Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation
of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we
derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is
related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and
is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and
a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling
stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we
obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this
theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which
estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target
domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results
across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final
accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster,
more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small
initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon
publication.

Result: 实验表明DistDF提升了多种预测模型的性能，并达到最先进的预测效果。

Conclusion: DistDF通过新的分布差异度量方法，有效解决了传统预测方法的偏差问题，提升了预测性能。

Abstract: Training time-series forecast models requires aligning the conditional
distribution of model forecasts with that of the label sequence. The standard
direct forecast (DF) approach resorts to minimize the conditional negative
log-likelihood of the label sequence, typically estimated using the mean
squared error. However, this estimation proves to be biased in the presence of
label autocorrelation. In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves
alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional
forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are
difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a
newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series
forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of
interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from
empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.
Extensive experiments show that DistDF improves the performance diverse
forecast models and achieves the state-of-the-art forecasting performance. Code

Abstract: We are very delighted to see the fast development of physics-informed extreme
learning machine (PIELM) in recent years for higher computation efficiency and
accuracy in physics-informed machine learning. As a summary or review on PIELM
is currently not available, we would like to take this opportunity to show our
perspective and experience for this promising research direction. We can see
many efforts are made to solve PDEs with sharp gradients, nonlinearities,
high-frequency behavior, hard constraints, uncertainty, multiphysics coupling.
Despite the success, many urgent challenges remain to be tackled, which also
provides us opportunities to develop more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable PIELM frameworks with applications in science and engineering.

Conclusion: 量子方法与经典架构结合可开发轻量、高性能且可解释的预测模型，推动量子机器学习的应用。

Abstract: Current quantum machine learning approaches often face challenges balancing
predictive accuracy, robustness, and interpretability. To address this, we
propose a novel quantum adversarial framework that integrates a hybrid quantum
neural network (QNN) with classical deep learning layers, guided by an
evaluator model with LIME-based interpretability, and extended through quantum
GAN and self-supervised variants. In the proposed model, an adversarial
evaluator concurrently guides the QNN by computing feedback loss, thereby
optimizing both prediction accuracy and model explainability. Empirical
evaluations show that the Vanilla model achieves RMSE = 0.27, MSE = 0.071, MAE
= 0.21, and R^2 = 0.59, delivering the most consistent performance across
regression metrics compared to adversarial counterparts. These results
demonstrate the potential of combining quantum-inspired methods with classical
architectures to develop lightweight, high-performance, and interpretable
predictive models, advancing the applicability of QML beyond current
limitations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据驱动框架，结合两种学习方法提取健康指标（HIs），解决了复合材料结构健康监测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于材料特性变异、损伤演化的随机性及多样损伤模式，提取可靠的HIs具有挑战性。制造缺陷和服役事件进一步增加了复杂性。

Method: 提出了两种方法：(1) 多样性深度半监督异常检测（Diversity-DeepSAD），利用连续辅助标签作为损伤代理；(2) 退化趋势约束变分自编码器（DTC-VAE），嵌入单调性准则。

Result: Diversity-DeepSAD性能为81.6%，DTC-VAE性能达92.3%，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: DTC-VAE方法在一致性上表现最佳，为复合材料结构健康监测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Health indicators (HIs) are central to diagnosing and prognosing the
condition of aerospace composite structures, enabling efficient maintenance and
operational safety. However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to
variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse
damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents
(e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a
comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches
integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are
unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a
diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach
augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies,
which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish
healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a
degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the
monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided
waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener
composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency
representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised
ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using
fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved
81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3%
performance, outperforming existing baselines.

Motivation: 传统ILP算法每次训练仅学习单一假设，而集成方法需多次训练。本文旨在通过单次训练保存中间假设，减少计算开销。

Method: 单次运行ILP算法保存中间假设，采用最小描述长度加权方案结合假设。

Result: 在游戏和视觉推理等基准测试中，预测准确性提升4%，计算开销低于1%。

Conclusion: 该方法在提升预测准确性的同时显著降低计算开销，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Inductive logic programming (ILP) is a form of logical machine learning. Most
ILP algorithms learn a single hypothesis from a single training run. Ensemble
methods train an ILP algorithm multiple times to learn multiple hypotheses. In
this paper, we train an ILP algorithm only once and save intermediate
hypotheses. We then combine the hypotheses using a minimum description length
weighting scheme. Our experiments on multiple benchmarks, including game
playing and visual reasoning, show that our approach improves predictive
accuracy by 4% with less than 1% computational overhead.

TL;DR: DOTS（扩散有序时间结构）通过利用多个有效因果顺序而非单一顺序，改进了时间序列因果发现，提高了准确性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列因果发现因变量和时间点增加而变得复杂，传统基于顺序的方法限制了模型的表示能力。

Method: 提出DOTS方法，利用扩散过程进行因果发现，整合多个顺序以恢复有向无环图的传递闭包。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，DOTS优于现有基线方法，提高了F1分数并减少了运行时间。

Conclusion: DOTS是一种可扩展且准确的时间序列因果发现解决方案。

Abstract: Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for
understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate
dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is
hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal
relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A
common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods.
Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of
the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple
valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We
propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based
causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS
effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic
graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We
formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the
additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to
enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the
approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a
scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic
benchmarks ($d{=}\!3-\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\!-\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS
improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the
CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\!-\!36$), while baselines remain the
best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph
$F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These
results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal
discovery.

Motivation: 探讨在不同稳健比率ρ下，ReLU网络实现稳健记忆所需的参数数量。

Method: 通过上下界分析，研究了参数数量与ρ的关系，覆盖了ρ的整个范围(0,1)。

Result: 发现当ρ较小时，参数复杂性与非稳健记忆相同；随着ρ增大，参数复杂性增加。

Conclusion: 研究提供了更精确的上下界，改进了现有结果，揭示了稳健记忆参数复杂性的变化规律。

Abstract: We study the parameter complexity of robust memorization for $\mathrm{ReLU}$
networks: the number of parameters required to interpolate any given dataset
with $\epsilon$-separation between differently labeled points, while ensuring
predictions remain consistent within a $\mu$-ball around each training sample.
We establish upper and lower bounds on the parameter count as a function of the
robustness ratio $\rho = \mu / \epsilon$. Unlike prior work, we provide a
fine-grained analysis across the entire range $\rho \in (0,1)$ and obtain
tighter upper and lower bounds that improve upon existing results. Our findings
reveal that the parameter complexity of robust memorization matches that of
non-robust memorization when $\rho$ is small, but grows with increasing $\rho$.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand
complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that
limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have
recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving
promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their
performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data,
inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to
exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues,
we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation
model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges
with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale
synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an
SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational
symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3)
controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system
supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual
unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art
performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating
accurate (RMSD < 2 \r{A}) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold
3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters
benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the
next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers
$3.6\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug
targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 \r{A} threshold. Finally, we demonstrate
that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in
training.

Motivation: 现有方法仅能恢复核函数顶部特征函数的线性跨度，而精确的谱分解对理解特征排序和重要性至关重要。

Method: 设计了模块化构建块，满足与上下文核兼容性和可扩展性，并展示了低秩近似和瑞利商优化两种方法如何与该框架对齐。

Result: 在合成核和真实图像数据集上验证了方法的有效性，提取的特征值可作为特征选择的重要性评分。

Conclusion: 该框架支持通过自适应维度表示实现效率-准确性的权衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in representation learning reveal that widely used
objectives, such as contrastive and non-contrastive, implicitly perform
spectral decomposition of a contextual kernel, induced by the relationship
between inputs and their contexts. Yet, these methods recover only the linear
span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition
is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work,
we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable
eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key
desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability
to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms,
low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this
framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on
synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the
recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection,
enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional
representations.

Result: 混合选项策略在不同交通条件下表现最佳，优于基线策略。

Conclusion: 选项框架在自动驾驶中具有潜力，能够结合领域知识并提升驾驶行为的灵活性和可解释性。

Abstract: Out of the many deep reinforcement learning approaches for autonomous
driving, only few make use of the options (or skills) framework. That is
surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control
applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore,
in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous
driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for
longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort
constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the
learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more
easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and
derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning
techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral
control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the
same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier
to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the
investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform
the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies
over actions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管RLHF在实践中取得了成功，但其理论基础仍有限，尤其是在KL正则化目标和偏好反馈下的学习挑战。

Method: 研究采用一般偏好模型，直接使用经验估计（贪婪采样），而非传统的乐观或悲观估计。

Result: 新方法在性能上显著优于现有方法，且贪婪采样在RLHF中表现出惊人的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了KL正则化目标下最优策略类的独特结构特性，为RLHF的理论和实践提供了新见解。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key
technique for post-training large language models. Despite its empirical
success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning
the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional
challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the
reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs
utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general
preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and
obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over
existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that
directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to
constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This
insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy
class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT
model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.

Result: 实验显示RoboOmni在成功率、推理速度等方面优于基线。

Conclusion: RoboOmni为机器人主动协作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have driven rapid
progress in Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for robotic manipulation.
Although effective in many scenarios, current approaches largely rely on
explicit instructions, whereas in real-world interactions, humans rarely issue
instructions directly. Effective collaboration requires robots to infer user
intentions proactively. In this work, we introduce cross-modal contextual
instructions, a new setting where intent is derived from spoken dialogue,
environmental sounds, and visual cues rather than explicit commands. To address
this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor
framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention
recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses
auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition,
while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training
data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build
OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640
backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types. Experiments in simulation
and real-world settings show that RoboOmni surpasses text- and ASR-based
baselines in success rate, inference speed, intention recognition, and
proactive assistance.

Abstract: While the efficacy of social robots in supporting people in learning tasks
has been extensively investigated, their potential impact in assisting students
in self-studying contexts has not been investigated much. This study explores
how a social robot can act as a peer study companion for college students
during self-study tasks by delivering task-oriented goal reminder and positive
emotional support. We conducted an exploratory Wizard-of-Oz study to explore
how these robotic support behaviors impacted students' perceived focus,
productivity, and engagement in comparison to a robot that only provided
physical presence (control). Our study results suggest that participants in the
goal reminder and the emotional support conditions reported greater ease of
use, with the goal reminder condition additionally showing a higher willingness
to use the robot in future study sessions. Participants' satisfaction with the
robot was correlated with their perception of the robot as a social other, and
this perception was found to be a predictor for their level of goal achievement
in the self-study task. These findings highlight the potential of socially
assistive robots to support self-study through both functional and emotional
engagement.

Abstract: Wheeled-legged robots combine the efficiency of wheels with the obstacle
negotiation of legs, yet many state-of-the-art systems rely on costly actuators
and sensors, and fall-recovery is seldom integrated, especially for
wheeled-legged morphologies. This work presents a recovery-aware
visual-inertial navigation system on a low-cost wheeled quadruped. The proposed
system leverages vision-based perception from a depth camera and deep
reinforcement learning policies for robust locomotion and autonomous recovery
from falls across diverse terrains. Simulation experiments show agile mobility
with low-torque actuators over irregular terrain and reliably recover from
external perturbations and self-induced failures. We further show goal directed
navigation in structured indoor spaces with low-cost perception. Overall, this
approach lowers the barrier to deploying autonomous navigation and robust
locomotion policies in budget-constrained robotic platforms.

Conclusion: 该方法为自适应感知系统提供了有效解决方案，适用于复杂动态场景。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive keyframe selection method for improved
3D scene reconstruction in dynamic environments. The proposed method integrates
two complementary modules: an error-based selection module utilizing
photometric and structural similarity (SSIM) errors, and a momentum-based
update module that dynamically adjusts keyframe selection thresholds according
to scene motion dynamics. By dynamically curating the most informative frames,
our approach addresses a key data bottleneck in real-time perception. This
allows for the creation of high-quality 3D world representations from a
compressed data stream, a critical step towards scalable robot learning and
deployment in complex, dynamic environments. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements over traditional static keyframe selection strategies,
such as fixed temporal intervals or uniform frame skipping. These findings
highlight a meaningful advancement toward adaptive perception systems that can
dynamically respond to complex and evolving visual scenes. We evaluate our
proposed adaptive keyframe selection module on two recent state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction networks, Spann3r and CUT3R, and observe consistent improvements
in reconstruction quality across both frameworks. Furthermore, an extensive
ablation study confirms the effectiveness of each individual component in our
method, underlining their contribution to the overall performance gains.

Abstract: Tendon-actuated concentric tube mechanisms combine the advantages of
tendon-driven continuum robots and concentric tube robots while addressing
their respective limitations. They overcome the restricted degrees of freedom
often seen in tendon-driven designs, and mitigate issues such as snapping
instability associated with concentric tube robots. However, a complete and
general mechanical model for these systems remains an open problem. In this
work, we propose a Cosserat rod-based framework for modeling the general case
of $n$ concentric tubes, each actuated by $m_i$ tendons, where $i = \{1,
\ldots, n\}$. The model allows each tube to twist and elongate while enforcing
a shared centerline for bending. We validate the proposed framework through
experiments with two-tube and three tube assemblies under various tendon
routing configurations, achieving tip prediction errors $<4\%$ of the robot's
total length. We further demonstrate the model's generality by applying it to
existing robots in the field, where maximum tip deviations remain around $5\%$
of the total length. This model provides a foundation for accurate shape
estimation and control of advanced tendon-actuated concentric tube robots.

Abstract: This paper presents a soft robot finger capable of adaptive-twist deformation
to grasp objects by wrapping them. For a soft hand to grasp and pick-up one
object from densely contained multiple objects, a soft finger requires the
adaptive-twist deformation function in both in-plane and out-of-plane
directions. The function allows the finger to be inserted deeply into a limited
gap among objects. Once inserted, the soft finger requires appropriate control
of grasping force normal to contact surface, thereby maintaining the twisted
deformation. In this paper, we refer to this type of grasping as grasping by
wrapping. To achieve these two functions by a single actuation source, we
propose a variable stiffness mechanism that can adaptively change the stiffness
as the pressure is higher. We conduct a finite element analysis (FEA) on the
proposed mechanism and determine its design parameter based on the FEA result.
Using the developed soft finger, we report basic experimental results and
demonstrations on grasping various objects.

Abstract: This survey comprehensively reviews the evolving field of multi-robot
collaborative Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) using 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS). As an explicit scene representation, 3DGS has enabled
unprecedented real-time, high-fidelity render- ing, ideal for robotics.
However, its use in multi-robot systems introduces significant challenges in
maintaining global consistency, managing communication, and fusing data from
heterogeneous sources. We systematically categorize approaches by their
architecture-centralized, distributed- and analyze core components like
multi-agent consistency and alignment, communication- efficient, Gaussian
representation, semantic distillation, fusion and pose optimization, and real-
time scalability. In addition, a summary of critical datasets and evaluation
metrics is provided to contextualize performance. Finally, we identify key open
challenges and chart future research directions, including lifelong mapping,
semantic association and mapping, multi-model for robustness, and bridging the
Sim2Real gap.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端深度强化学习方法在安全性和可解释性上存在局限，尤其在面对新地形时。

Result: 在楼梯任务中，VOCALoco在仿真和实际场景中均表现出比传统方法更高的鲁棒性和安全性。

Conclusion: VOCALoco为腿式机器人提供了一种更安全、高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in legged robot locomotion have facilitated traversal
over increasingly complex terrains. Despite this progress, many existing
approaches rely on end-to-end deep reinforcement learning (DRL), which poses
limitations in terms of safety and interpretability, especially when
generalizing to novel terrains. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
VOCALoco, a modular skill-selection framework that dynamically adapts
locomotion strategies based on perceptual input. Given a set of pre-trained
locomotion policies, VOCALoco evaluates their viability and energy-consumption
by predicting both the safety of execution and the anticipated cost of
transport over a fixed planning horizon. This joint assessment enables the
selection of policies that are both safe and energy-efficient, given the
observed local terrain. We evaluate our approach on staircase locomotion tasks,
demonstrating its performance in both simulated and real-world scenarios using
a quadrupedal robot. Empirical results show that VOCALoco achieves improved
robustness and safety during stair ascent and descent compared to a
conventional end-to-end DRL policy

*Andrew Gerstenslager,Bekarys Dukenbaev,Ali A. Minai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种改进的边界向量细胞（BVC）模型，通过引入垂直角度敏感性，解决了传统2D模型在三维环境中的空间模糊性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统BVC模型仅限于2D环境，无法有效处理三维环境中的水平对称性问题，限制了其在真实世界导航中的应用。

Method: 在BVC框架中引入垂直角度敏感性，利用LiDAR数据捕捉垂直轮廓，从而在三维环境中实现更准确的边界检测。

Result: 实验表明，在垂直变化较少的环境中，3D模型与2D基线性能相当；而在复杂3D环境中，3D模型显著减少了空间混叠并生成了更多独特的空间场。

Conclusion: 通过增加垂直维度，BVC模型在真实3D空间中的导航和地图构建能力得到显著提升，同时在简单平面环境中保持性能一致。

Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of
vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and
allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the
hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional
(2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of
horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we
incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby
enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to
significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired
robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby
disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D
representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal
vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D
baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more
distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings
show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can
significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while
retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.

Motivation: 真实世界数据限制了训练场景的多样性，合成数据可弥补这一不足，但缺乏指定ego车辆和传感器输入。

Method: 在合成场景中指定信息最全的代理为ego车辆，将路径级场景投影到地图上，使用Map-to-BEV网络生成鸟瞰图特征，并设计训练策略整合合成与真实数据。

Result: 实验表明SynAD有效整合各组件，显著提升安全性能。

Conclusion: SynAD为更全面、鲁棒的自动驾驶模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning and the availability of high-quality
real-world driving datasets have propelled end-to-end autonomous driving.
Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of
driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a
promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its
application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily
due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor
inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To
address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance
real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent
with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a
multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto
maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view
features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training
strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real
driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively
integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging
synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more
comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.

Abstract: Perceptual ambiguity and task conflict limit multitask robotic manipulation
via imitation learning. We propose a framework combining a Language-Conditioned
Visual Representation (LCVR) module and a Language-conditioned
Mixture-ofExperts Density Policy (LMoE-DP). LCVR resolves perceptual
ambiguities by grounding visual features with language instructions, enabling
differentiation between visually similar tasks. To mitigate task conflict,
LMoE-DP uses a sparse expert architecture to specialize in distinct, multimodal
action distributions, stabilized by gradient modulation. On real-robot
benchmarks, LCVR boosts Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) and Diffusion
Policy (DP) success rates by 33.75% and 25%, respectively. The full framework
achieves a 79% average success, outperforming the advanced baseline by 21%. Our
work shows that combining semantic grounding and expert specialization enables
robust, efficient multi-task manipulation

  A distributed weighted topological graph Voronoi algorithm is introduced
implementing balanced graph space partitions of the fused topological maps.
Theoretical guarantees are provided for distributed consensus convergence and
equitable graph space partitions with constant bounds.
  A local planner optimizes the visitation sequence of exploration targets

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了腿式机器人在轨迹优化中的动力学和摩擦锥约束问题。

Abstract: To generate reliable motion for legged robots through trajectory
optimization, it is crucial to simultaneously compute the robot's path and
contact sequence, as well as accurately consider the dynamics in the problem
formulation. In this paper, we present a phase-based trajectory optimization
that ensures the feasibility of translational dynamics and friction cone
constraints throughout the entire trajectory. Specifically, our approach
leverages the superposition properties of linear differential equations to
decouple the translational dynamics for each contact point, which operates
under different phase sequences. Furthermore, we utilize the differentiation
matrix of B{\'e}zier polynomials to derive an analytical relationship between
the robot's position and force, thereby ensuring the consistent satisfaction of
translational dynamics. Additionally, by exploiting the convex closure property
of B{\'e}zier polynomials, our method ensures compliance with friction cone
constraints. Using the aforementioned approach, the proposed trajectory
optimization framework can generate dynamically reliable motions with various
gait sequences for legged robots. We validate our framework using a quadruped
robot model, focusing on the feasibility of dynamics and motion generation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 避免模仿学习的局限性（如专家演示不足和协变量偏移），同时直接从原始传感器数据中学习。

Method: 提出ZTRS框架，结合离线强化学习和EPO（一种针对可枚举动作和奖励的策略梯度变体）。

Result: 在Navhard基准测试中达到SOTA，并在HUGSIM上优于基于模仿学习的基线。

Conclusion: ZTRS展示了直接从传感器数据学习并通过强化训练实现鲁棒规划的潜力。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving maps raw sensor inputs directly into
ego-vehicle trajectories to avoid cascading errors from perception modules and
to leverage rich semantic cues. Existing frameworks largely rely on Imitation
Learning (IL), which can be limited by sub-optimal expert demonstrations and
covariate shift during deployment. On the other hand, Reinforcement Learning
(RL) has recently shown potential in scaling up with simulations, but is
typically confined to low-dimensional symbolic inputs (e.g. 3D objects and
maps), falling short of full end-to-end learning from raw sensor data. We
introduce ZTRS (Zero-Imitation End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Trajectory
Scoring), a framework that combines the strengths of both worlds: sensor inputs
without losing information and RL training for robust planning. To the best of
our knowledge, ZTRS is the first framework that eliminates IL entirely by only
learning from rewards while operating directly on high-dimensional sensor data.
ZTRS utilizes offline reinforcement learning with our proposed Exhaustive
Policy Optimization (EPO), a variant of policy gradient tailored for enumerable
actions and rewards. ZTRS demonstrates strong performance across three
benchmarks: Navtest (generic real-world open-loop planning), Navhard (open-loop
planning in challenging real-world and synthetic scenarios), and HUGSIM
(simulated closed-loop driving). Specifically, ZTRS achieves the
state-of-the-art result on Navhard and outperforms IL-based baselines on
HUGSIM. Code will be available at https://github.com/woxihuanjiangguo/ZTRS.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked a
significant breakthrough in Artificial Intelligence (AI), ushering in a new era
of Human-centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI). HAI aims to better serve human
welfare and needs, thereby placing higher demands on the intelligence level of
robots, particularly in aspects such as natural language interaction, complex
task planning, and execution. Intelligent agents powered by LLMs have opened up
new pathways for realizing HAI. However, existing LLM-based embodied agents
often lack the ability to plan and execute complex natural language control
tasks online. This paper explores the implementation of intelligent robotic
manipulating agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in the physical
world. We propose a novel embodied agent framework for robots, which comprises
a human-robot voice interaction module, a vision-language agent module and an
action execution module. The vision-language agent itself includes a
vision-based task planner, a natural language instruction converter, and a task
performance feedback evaluator. Experimental results demonstrate that our agent
achieves a 28\% higher average task success rate in both simulated and real
environments compared to approaches relying solely on LLM+CLIP, significantly
improving the execution success rate of high-level natural language instruction
tasks.

Abstract: Navigating to a designated goal using visual information is a fundamental
capability for intelligent robots. Most classical visual navigation methods are
restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To
address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and
multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that
leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo
constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system
queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local
perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals
during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a
high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal
open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that
LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal
localization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
multi-goal visual navigation. Project page:

Result: 盲专家克隆在未见任务上优于完全信息专家，泛化误差与√(I/m)相关。

Conclusion: 隐藏信息的行为克隆在任务较少时泛化更好，理论和实验均支持。

Abstract: Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning
sequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained
prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where
achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of
tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates
a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the
task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is
compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that
cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its
fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg
insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from
the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical
analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with
$\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to
the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and
practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with
fewer demonstrated tasks. Project page with videos and code:

Conclusion: HMAMP是朝着开发能够以人类方式操纵工具和物体的机器人系统迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in developing robots and
autonomous systems that can interact with human in a more natural and intuitive
way. One of the key challenges in achieving this goal is to enable these
systems to manipulate objects and tools in a manner that is similar to that of
humans. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for learning human-style
manipulation skills by using adversarial motion priors, which we name HMAMP.
The approach leverages adversarial networks to model the complex dynamics of
tool and object manipulation, as well as the aim of the manipulation task. The
discriminator is trained using a combination of real-world data and simulation
data executed by the agent, which is designed to train a policy that generates
realistic motion trajectories that match the statistical properties of human
motion. We evaluated HMAMP on one challenging manipulation task: hammering, and
the results indicate that HMAMP is capable of learning human-style manipulation
skills that outperform current baseline methods. Additionally, we demonstrate
that HMAMP has potential for real-world applications by performing real robot
arm hammering tasks. In general, HMAMP represents a significant step towards
developing robots and autonomous systems that can interact with humans in a
more natural and intuitive way, by learning to manipulate tools and objects in
a manner similar to how humans do.

Motivation: 由于真实世界训练数据的稀缺性，学习泛化的机器人操作策略仍具挑战性。现有方法多依赖2D视觉预训练或大规模视频预测模型，未能同时学习几何、语义和动态信息。

Conclusion: DynaRend通过统一的三平面表示，有效结合了空间几何、未来动态和任务语义，为机器人操作任务提供了强大的表征学习框架。

Abstract: Learning generalizable robotic manipulation policies remains a key challenge
due to the scarcity of diverse real-world training data. While recent
approaches have attempted to mitigate this through self-supervised
representation learning, most either rely on 2D vision pretraining paradigms
such as masked image modeling, which primarily focus on static semantics or
scene geometry, or utilize large-scale video prediction models that emphasize
2D dynamics, thus failing to jointly learn the geometry, semantics, and
dynamics required for effective manipulation. In this paper, we present
DynaRend, a representation learning framework that learns 3D-aware and
dynamics-informed triplane features via masked reconstruction and future
prediction using differentiable volumetric rendering. By pretraining on
multi-view RGB-D video data, DynaRend jointly captures spatial geometry, future
dynamics, and task semantics in a unified triplane representation. The learned
representations can be effectively transferred to downstream robotic
manipulation tasks via action value map prediction. We evaluate DynaRend on two
challenging benchmarks, RLBench and Colosseum, as well as in real-world robotic
experiments, demonstrating substantial improvements in policy success rate,
generalization to environmental perturbations, and real-world applicability
across diverse manipulation tasks.

Result: 算法在动态环境中实时生成安全轨迹，适用于静态和动态场景。

Conclusion: CoNi-OA为无人机协作任务提供了一种高效、安全的避障解决方案。

Abstract: CoNi-MPC provides an efficient framework for UAV control in air-ground
cooperative tasks by relying exclusively on relative states, eliminating the
need for global state estimation. However, its lack of environmental
information poses significant challenges for obstacle avoidance. To address
this issue, we propose a novel obstacle avoidance algorithm, Cooperative
Non-inertial frame-based Obstacle Avoidance (CoNi-OA), designed explicitly for
UAV-UGV cooperative scenarios without reliance on global state estimation or
obstacle prediction. CoNi-OA uniquely utilizes a single frame of raw LiDAR data
from the UAV to generate a modulation matrix, which directly adjusts the
quadrotor's velocity to achieve obstacle avoidance. This modulation-based
method enables real-time generation of collision-free trajectories within the
UGV's non-inertial frame, significantly reducing computational demands (less
than 5 ms per iteration) while maintaining safety in dynamic and unpredictable
environments. The key contributions of this work include: (1) a
modulation-based obstacle avoidance algorithm specifically tailored for UAV-UGV
cooperation in non-inertial frames without global states; (2) rapid, real-time
trajectory generation based solely on single-frame LiDAR data, removing the
need for obstacle modeling or prediction; and (3) adaptability to both static
and dynamic environments, thus extending applicability to featureless or
unknown scenarios.

Method: 利用微分平坦性框架，直接纳入非线性摩擦和碰撞避免约束，仅在终点限制载荷摆动。

Result: 仿真表明忽略干摩擦会导致执行器饱和和碰撞，摩擦建模是实现快速安全轨迹的关键。

Abstract: This paper presents an optimal trajectory generation method for 3D overhead
cranes by leveraging differential flatness. This framework enables the direct
inclusion of complex physical and dynamic constraints, such as nonlinear
friction and collision avoidance for both payload and rope. Our approach allows
for aggressive movements by constraining payload swing only at the final point.
A comparative simulation study validates our approach, demonstrating that
neglecting dry friction leads to actuator saturation and collisions. The
results show that friction modeling is a fundamental requirement for fast and
safe crane trajectories.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法的高效性，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 该方法通过双层优化和并行计算，显著提升了噪声协方差估计的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Reliable state estimation hinges on accurate specification of sensor noise
covariances, which weigh heterogeneous measurements. In practice, these
covariances are difficult to identify due to environmental variability,
front-end preprocessing, and other reasons. We address this by formulating
noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization that, from a Bayesian
perspective, factorizes the joint likelihood of so-called odometry and
supervisory measurements, thereby balancing information utilization with
computational efficiency. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian
dependency into a chain structure, enabling efficient parallel computation: at
the lower level, an invariant extended Kalman filter with state augmentation
estimates trajectories, while a derivative filter computes analytical gradients
in parallel for upper-level gradient updates. The upper level refines the
covariance to guide the lower-level estimation. Experiments on synthetic and
real-world datasets show that our method achieves higher efficiency over
existing baselines.

*Malintha Fernando,Petter Ögren,Silun Zhang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了随机奖励收集游戏（SPCG）作为团队定向问题（TOP）的扩展，用于在自利机器人竞争环境下规划路径，并提出了两种算法ORS和FORL。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人系统中机器人竞争奖励稀缺环境下的路径规划问题，扩展了传统TOP的局限性。

Method: 提出了SPCG模型，并设计了ORS算法获取局部排名和FORL算法学习最优策略。

Result: 实验表明ORS和FORL在动态和静态奖励分布下表现优于其他方法，学习到的策略接近最优解。

Conclusion: SPCG和提出的算法在多机器人竞争环境中具有高效性和可扩展性，接近最优解。

Abstract: The Team Orienteering Problem (TOP) generalizes many real-world multi-robot
scheduling and routing tasks that occur in autonomous mobility, aerial
logistics, and surveillance applications. While many flavors of the TOP exist
for planning in multi-robot systems, they assume that all the robots cooperate
toward a single objective; thus, they do not extend to settings where the
robots compete in reward-scarce environments. We propose Stochastic
Prize-Collecting Games (SPCG) as an extension of the TOP to plan in the
presence of self-interested robots operating on a graph, under energy
constraints and stochastic transitions. A theoretical study on complete and
star graphs establishes that there is a unique pure Nash equilibrium in SPCGs
that coincides with the optimal routing solution of an equivalent TOP given a
rank-based conflict resolution rule. This work proposes two algorithms: Ordinal
Rank Search (ORS) to obtain the ''ordinal rank'' --one's effective rank in
temporarily-formed local neighborhoods during the games' stages, and Fictitious
Ordinal Response Learning (FORL) to obtain best-response policies against one's
senior-rank opponents. Empirical evaluations conducted on road networks and
synthetic graphs under both dynamic and stationary prize distributions show
that 1) the state-aliasing induced by OR-conditioning enables learning policies
that scale more efficiently to large team sizes than those trained with the
global index, and 2) Policies trained with FORL generalize better to imbalanced
prize distributions than those with other multi-agent training methods.
Finally, the learned policies in the SPCG achieved between 87% and 95%
optimality compared to an equivalent TOP solution obtained by mixed-integer
linear programming.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GeVI-SLAM是一种重力增强的立体视觉惯性SLAM系统，通过直接深度估计和重力初始化，解决了水下机器人SLAM中的视觉退化和IMU激励不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下机器人SLAM面临视觉退化和IMU运动激励不足的挑战，需要更稳定的解决方案。

Method: 利用立体相机直接深度估计，避免尺度估计；通过重力初始化解耦俯仰和横滚，使用4-DOF PnP求解器；提出偏差消除的4-DOF PnP估计器，并联合估计IMU协方差。

Result: GeVI-SLAM在模拟和真实数据实验中表现出更高的准确性和稳定性。

Conclusion: GeVI-SLAM通过重力增强和优化方法，显著提升了水下SLAM的性能。

Abstract: Accurate visual inertial simultaneous localization and mapping (VI SLAM) for
underwater robots remains a significant challenge due to frequent visual
degeneracy and insufficient inertial measurement unit (IMU) motion excitation.
In this paper, we present GeVI-SLAM, a gravity-enhanced stereo VI SLAM system
designed to address these issues. By leveraging the stereo camera's direct
depth estimation ability, we eliminate the need to estimate scale during IMU
initialization, enabling stable operation even under low acceleration dynamics.
With precise gravity initialization, we decouple the pitch and roll from the
pose estimation and solve a 4 degrees of freedom (DOF) Perspective-n-Point
(PnP) problem for pose tracking. This allows the use of a minimal 3-point
solver, which significantly reduces computational time to reject outliers
within a Random Sample Consensus framework. We further propose a
bias-eliminated 4-DOF PnP estimator with provable consistency, ensuring the
relative pose converges to the true value as the feature number increases. To
handle dynamic motion, we refine the full 6-DOF pose while jointly estimating
the IMU covariance, enabling adaptive weighting of the gravity prior. Extensive
experiments on simulated and real-world data demonstrate that GeVI-SLAM
achieves higher accuracy and greater stability compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖已知环境模型规划巡检路线，但实际环境可能因自然或人为活动发生变化，导致模型与实际条件不符。

Method: 框架分为两部分：(a)基于历史地图生成全局视图计划；(b)局部视图重规划以适应当前场景形态。

Result: 该方法在真实地下矿井中通过四足机器人验证，能够保持全局覆盖目标并适应局部环境变化。

Conclusion: 分层框架在环境不确定性下实现了鲁棒的巡检任务完成。

Abstract: In this work, we present a hierarchical framework designed to support robotic
inspection under environment uncertainty. By leveraging a known environment
model, existing methods plan and safely track inspection routes to visit points
of interest. However, discrepancies between the model and actual site
conditions, caused by either natural or human activities, can alter the surface
morphology or introduce path obstructions. To address this challenge, the
proposed framework divides the inspection task into: (a) generating the initial
global view-plan for region of interests based on a historical map and (b)
local view replanning to adapt to the current morphology of the inspection
scene. The proposed hierarchy preserves global coverage objectives while
enabling reactive adaptation to the local surface morphology. This enables the
local autonomy to remain robust against environment uncertainty and complete
the inspection tasks. We validate the approach through deployments in
real-world subterranean mines using quadrupedal robot.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一迭代校准（UIC）框架，用于解决水下SLAM系统中传感器外参和时间偏移的联合估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法对多普勒速度日志（DVL）校准的局限性，无法同时估计外参和时间偏移。

Method: 采用最大后验（MAP）估计和高斯过程（GP）运动先验，交替更新运动状态和校准变量。

Result: UIC适用于多种传感器配置，并通过仿真和实际测试验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: UIC不仅适用于水下应用，其方法还可推广到其他多传感器校准问题。

Abstract: The calibration of extrinsic parameters and clock offsets between sensors for
high-accuracy performance in underwater SLAM systems remains insufficiently
explored. Existing methods for Doppler Velocity Log (DVL) calibration are
either constrained to specific sensor configurations or rely on oversimplified
assumptions, and none jointly estimate translational extrinsics and time
offsets. We propose a Unified Iterative Calibration (UIC) framework for general
DVL sensor setups, formulated as a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation with a
Gaussian Process (GP) motion prior for high-fidelity motion interpolation. UIC
alternates between efficient GP-based motion state updates and gradient-based
calibration variable updates, supported by a provably statistically consistent
sequential initialization scheme. The proposed UIC can be applied to IMU,
cameras and other modalities as co-sensors. We release an open-source
DVL-camera calibration toolbox. Beyond underwater applications, several aspects
of UIC-such as the integration of GP priors for MAP-based calibration and the
design of provably reliable initialization procedures-are broadly applicable to
other multi-sensor calibration problems. Finally, simulations and real-world
tests validate our approach.

Method: 利用抛体运动定律稠密化稀疏奖励，采用参考状态初始化加速探索，结合行走策略扩展运动能力。

Result: 实验验证了在多种地形上的行走能力，水平跳跃达1.25米（厘米级精度），垂直跳跃达1.0米，并可扩展为全向跳跃。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了Sim2Real差距，展示了多功能动态运动的潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents a curriculum-based reinforcement learning framework for
training precise and high-performance jumping policies for the robot `Olympus'.
Separate policies are developed for vertical and horizontal jumps, leveraging a
simple yet effective strategy. First, we densify the inherently sparse jumping
reward using the laws of projectile motion. Next, a reference state
initialization scheme is employed to accelerate the exploration of dynamic
jumping behaviors without reliance on reference trajectories. We also present a
walking policy that, when combined with the jumping policies, unlocks versatile
and dynamic locomotion capabilities. Comprehensive testing validates walking on
varied terrain surfaces and jumping performance that exceeds previous works,
effectively crossing the Sim2Real gap. Experimental validation demonstrates
horizontal jumps up to 1.25 m with centimeter accuracy and vertical jumps up to
1.0 m. Additionally, we show that with only minor modifications, the proposed
method can be used to learn omnidirectional jumping.

Result: 在SemanticKITTI和HeLiPR数据集上表现优于现有方法，ATE低于50 cm，支持多种传感器。

Conclusion: GroundLoc是一种高效、轻量级的定位方案，适用于多种传感器和大规模环境。

Abstract: In this letter, we introduce GroundLoc, a LiDAR-only localization pipeline
designed to localize a mobile robot in large-scale outdoor environments using
prior maps. GroundLoc employs a Bird's-Eye View (BEV) image projection focusing
on the perceived ground area and utilizes the place recognition network R2D2,
or alternatively, the non-learning approach Scale-Invariant Feature Transform
(SIFT), to identify and select keypoints for BEV image map registration. Our
results demonstrate that GroundLoc outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the
SemanticKITTI and HeLiPR datasets across various sensors. In the multi-session
localization evaluation, GroundLoc reaches an Average Trajectory Error (ATE)
well below 50 cm on all Ouster OS2 128 sequences while meeting online runtime
requirements. The system supports various sensor models, as evidenced by
evaluations conducted with Velodyne HDL-64E, Ouster OS2 128, Aeva Aeries II,
and Livox Avia sensors. The prior maps are stored as 2D raster image maps,
which can be created from a single drive and require only 4 MB of storage per
square kilometer. The source code is available at

Result: 模型能准确重建原始场景并生成多样化的合成场景，潜在空间分析显示部分解耦特性。

Conclusion: 该模型可用于智能驾驶功能的验证和开发数据增强。

Abstract: With the increasing integration of intelligent driving functions into
serial-produced vehicles, ensuring their functionality and robustness poses
greater challenges. Compared to traditional road testing, scenario-based
virtual testing offers significant advantages in terms of time and cost
efficiency, reproducibility, and exploration of edge cases. We propose a
Transformer-enhanced Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE-T) model for
generating multi-agent traffic scenarios in roundabouts, which are
characterized by high vehicle dynamics and complex layouts, yet remain
relatively underexplored in current research. The results show that the
proposed model can accurately reconstruct original scenarios and generate
realistic, diverse synthetic scenarios. Besides, two Key-Performance-Indicators
(KPIs) are employed to evaluate the interactive behavior in the generated
scenarios. Analysis of the latent space reveals partial disentanglement, with
several latent dimensions exhibiting distinct and interpretable effects on
scenario attributes such as vehicle entry timing, exit timing, and velocity
profiles. The results demonstrate the model's capability to generate scenarios
for the validation of intelligent driving functions involving multi-agent
interactions, as well as to augment data for their development and iterative
improvement.

Result: 在噪声干扰较小时，方法能准确预测步态和关节角度，误差分别为8.71%和6.78%。

Conclusion: 该方法在动力假肢障碍跨越中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: For amputees with powered transfemoral prosthetics, navigating obstacles or
complex terrain remains challenging. This study addresses this issue by using
an inertial sensor on the sound ankle to guide obstacle-crossing movements. A
genetic algorithm computes the optimal neural network structure to predict the
required angles of the thigh and knee joints. A gait progression prediction
algorithm determines the actuation angle index for the prosthetic knee motor,
ultimately defining the necessary thigh and knee angles and gait progression.
Results show that when the standard deviation of Gaussian noise added to the
thigh angle data is less than 1, the method can effectively eliminate noise
interference, achieving 100\% accuracy in gait phase estimation under 150 Hz,
with thigh angle prediction error being 8.71\% and knee angle prediction error
being 6.78\%. These findings demonstrate the method's ability to accurately
predict gait progression and joint angles, offering significant practical value
for obstacle negotiation in powered transfemoral prosthetics.

Result: 实验表明，Fare能在复杂环境中实现长期稳健导航，适用于多种策略架构。

Conclusion: Fare框架为模仿学习策略提供了故障恢复能力，提升了在复杂环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: While imitation learning (IL) enables effective visual navigation, IL
policies are prone to unpredictable failures in out-of-distribution (OOD)
scenarios. We advance the notion of failure-resilient policies, which not only
detect failures but also recover from them automatically. Failure recognition
that identifies the factors causing failure is key to informing recovery: e.g.
pinpointing image regions triggering failure detections can provide cues to
guide recovery. We present Fare, a framework to construct failure-resilient IL
policies, embedding OOD-detection and recognition in them without using
explicit failure data, and pairing them with recovery heuristics. Real-world
experiments show that Fare enables failure recovery across two different policy
architectures, enabling robust long-range navigation in complex environments.

Result: 发现现有控制器常缺乏运动学考虑、控制点连续性和运动稳定性。

Conclusion: 该框架可用于未来设计和比较避障方法。

Abstract: Real-time control is an essential aspect of safe robot operation in the real
world with dynamic objects. We present a framework for the analysis of
object-aware controllers, methods for altering a robot's motion to anticipate
and avoid possible collisions. This framework is focused on three design
considerations: kinematics, motion profiles, and virtual constraints.
Additionally, the analysis in this work relies on verification of robot
behaviors using fundamental robot-obstacle experimental scenarios. To showcase
the effectiveness of our method we compare three representative object-aware
controllers. The comparison uses metrics originating from the design
considerations. From the analysis, we find that the design of object-aware
controllers often lacks kinematic considerations, continuity of control points,
and stability in movement profiles. We conclude that this framework can be used
in the future to design, compare, and benchmark obstacle avoidance methods.

Abstract: Softening and onboarding computers and controllers is one of the final
frontiers in soft robotics towards their robustness and intelligence for
everyday use. In this regard, embodying soft and physical computing presents
exciting potential. Physical computing seeks to encode inputs into a mechanical
computing kernel and leverage the internal interactions among this kernel's
constituent elements to compute the output. Moreover, such input-to-output
evolution can be re-programmable. This perspective paper proposes a framework
for embodying physical computing into soft robots and discusses three unique
strategies in the literature: analog oscillators, physical reservoir computing,
and physical algorithmic computing. These embodied computers enable the soft
robot to perform complex behaviors that would otherwise require CMOS-based
electronics -- including coordinated locomotion with obstacle avoidance,
payload weight and orientation classification, and programmable operation based
on logical rules. This paper will detail the working principles of these
embodied physical computing methods, survey the current state-of-the-art, and
present a perspective for future development.
