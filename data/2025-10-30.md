### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene是一个在线前馈框架，仅用两个连续环视图像重建4D动态场景，通过轻量级残差流网络和场景流建模动态，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态驾驶场景实时高保真重建的挑战，平衡质量和效率。

Method: 使用轻量级残差流网络预测动态对象的非刚性运动，结合静态场景先验，采用粗到细训练范式。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene在动态重建和新视角合成中表现优异，为实时应用提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ACM模型通过引入运动感知解码提升视频字幕质量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致描述模糊或语义不一致。

Method: 提出M-ACM框架，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示来增强字幕生成。

Result: M-ACM在描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面表现优异。

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频字幕设定了新标准，并发布了HMI数据集和基准。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合两种SAR模拟器生成合成数据的方法，以解决合成数据在自动目标识别（ATR）中的泛化问题，并展示了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标记的SAR数据，研究者使用合成数据训练ATR模型，但合成数据因简化假设而无法很好地泛化到真实数据。

Method: 结合两种基于不同物理模型的SAR模拟器（MOCEM和Salsa）生成合成数据，并采用ADASCA深度学习方法训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实数据上达到了接近88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合不同模拟器的互补优势，可以有效提升ATR模型在真实数据上的性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于机器学习的点云不确定性评估框架，用于量化移动激光扫描（MLS）点云的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取，因此需要一种数据驱动的方法。

Method: 使用随机森林（RF）和XGBoost两种集成学习模型，通过局部几何特征与点级误差的关系进行不确定性评估。

Result: 实验表明，两种模型能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性之间的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云的质量控制和误差分析提供了可扩展且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征，用于阿尔茨海默病的辅助诊断，准确率达95.11%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对及时干预至关重要，但现有研究较少结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行多模态分析。

Method: 设计了跨增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）和方向感知卷积模块（DACM），通过多模态数据学习自适应表示。

Result: 在25名AD患者和25名健康对照的数据集上，分类准确率达到95.11%，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过显式建模模态间依赖关系，显著提升了诊断性能，为AD辅助诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

### [6] [FPGA-based Lane Detection System incorporating Temperature and Light Control Units](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24778)
*Ibrahim Qamar,Saber Mahmoud,Seif Megahed,Mohamed Khaled,Saleh Hesham,Ahmed Matar,Saif Gebril,Mervat Mahmoud*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于FPGA的车道检测系统，使用Sobel算法进行边缘检测，能在1.17毫秒内完成处理，并输出车道信息。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能车辆的发展需要高效的车道检测技术，尤其是在复杂环境中。

Method: 采用FPGA架构和Sobel算法处理416x416图像，运行频率为150 MHz。

Result: 系统每1.17毫秒输出车道数量、当前车道索引及其边界信息，并具备环境适应性。

Conclusion: 该架构高效且适应性强，适用于智能车辆的车道检测需求。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ESCA框架通过高效的后训练量化和定制硬件加速器，显著提升了Codec Avatar模型在资源受限VR设备上的实时推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Codec Avatar模型在VR设备上因高计算需求导致的实时推理挑战。

Method: 提出后训练量化方法和定制硬件加速器，构建全栈优化框架ESCA。

Result: ESCA提升质量评分0.39，降低延迟3.36倍，支持100FPS渲染。

Conclusion: ESCA证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了视觉模型在图理解中的潜力，发现其在全局结构理解上优于图神经网络（GNNs），并提出了新基准GraphAbstract。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图神经网络（GNNs）的底层消息传递机制与人类视觉感知的全局结构捕捉方式不同，且现有基准混淆了领域特征与拓扑理解。

Method: 通过比较视觉模型与GNNs在GraphAbstract基准上的表现，评估模型对全局图属性的感知能力。

Result: 视觉模型在需要全局结构理解的任务上显著优于GNNs，且具有跨尺度泛化能力，而GNNs在全局模式抽象和大图规模下表现不佳。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解中具有未充分利用的潜力，尤其在需要全局拓扑意识和尺度不变推理的问题上，为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

### [9] [A Re-node Self-training Approach for Deep Graph-based Semi-supervised Classification on Multi-view Image Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24791)
*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RSGSLM提出了一种结合线性特征变换、多视图图融合和动态伪标签的图卷积网络方法，用于多视图数据的半监督学习，显著提升了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图方法和伪标签技术在多视图图像数据中效率受限，缺乏清晰的图结构和复杂数据集成挑战。

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合，动态整合伪标签到GCN损失函数，调整边界样本权重，并引入无监督平滑损失。

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上，RSGSLM优于现有半监督学习方法。

Conclusion: RSGSLM通过优化图结构和伪标签集成，有效解决了多视图数据半监督学习的挑战。

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言基准测试，基于专家创建的PISA测试，覆盖六种语言，用于评估视觉语言模型在多语言多模态推理中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试在高质量、人工验证的示例方面有限，且多依赖合成内容或仅限英语。PISA-Bench填补了这一空白。

Method: 从PISA测试中提取人类验证的示例，翻译成五种语言，构建并行语料库，并评估最先进的视觉语言模型。

Result: 小模型表现不佳，非英语语言性能显著下降，空间和几何推理错误率高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为多语言多模态推理研究提供了资源。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

Result: 建立了该领域的参考框架，总结了代表性应用和挑战，并提出了未来研究方向。

Conclusion: 该综述为高效VLAs的研究提供了基础，并指出了未来发展的路线图。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现，13个视觉语言模型中有12个表现出冲突适应的行为，类似于人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型是否表现出类似人类认知控制的冲突适应行为，并理解其表征基础。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试模型，并通过稀疏自编码器（SAEs）分析模型内部表征。

Result: 大多数模型表现出冲突适应行为，且发现与任务相关的超节点，其结构与人类阅读和颜色命名的自动性不对称一致。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的行为与人类认知控制相似，且其内部表征揭示了任务相关的神经机制。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DualCap的新方法，通过视觉提示增强图像描述生成，解决了现有方法仅依赖文本提示的语义鸿沟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未得到增强，尤其在对象细节或复杂场景中表现不足。

Method: DualCap采用双重检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉类似场景。通过从视觉类似场景的标题中提取关键词，并将其编码后与原始图像特征融合。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在性能上具有竞争力，且相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示和双重检索机制有效提升了图像描述的生成质量，同时保持了模型的轻量级特性。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估主观且耗时，深度学习虽自动化但存在准确性和特征透明度问题。

Method: 通过微调五种视觉架构、结合多级深度特征和特征选择方法，构建统一框架。

Result: 在FFE数据集上达到85.99%的准确率，优于现有研究8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中表现出高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Result: 深入分析了影响准确性的深层因素，如视频处理策略和视频特征与模型能力的对齐。

Conclusion: MVFNDB为未来MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和进步奠定了基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

Conclusion: 多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了一种高效的安全对齐解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Motivation: 多模态情感识别在人机交互中至关重要，但模态间差异和单模态情感信息表征困难仍是主要挑战。

Method: 使用对抗自编码器（AAE）学习各模态的判别性情感特征，并通过跨模态门机制模型（CGMM）减少模态差异，最后通过特征融合模块（FFM）进行多模态融合。

Result: 在公开数据集SIMS和MOSI上验证了MCIHN的优越性能。

Conclusion: MCIHN能有效提升多模态情感识别的准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Conclusion: 研究为流匹配模型的生成过程提供了新见解，有助于理解去噪器的作用及其重要性。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度视为离散分类问题，与生物成熟过程的连续性相冲突，导致信息丢失和模糊的类别边界。

Method: 改进RT-DETRv2模型，引入概率头来预测连续成熟度分布及其不确定性。

Result: 模型在大型水果数据集上达到85.6%的mAP，提供更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法为现代农业提供了更智能、不确定性感知的自动化系统。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Conclusion: 合理的关键点选择和简单插值技术可实现高效准确的手语识别，为可扩展系统铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成数据有效提升了相机运动的生成能力。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

Conclusion: M-SAM是一种模型无关的框架，能有效提升多模态学习的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Conclusion: IBIS架构显著提升了Wi-Fi传感的模型泛化能力，为实际应用提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言模型预训练成本高昂，效率问题阻碍了从头开始训练模型的尝试。

Method: 通过可解释的池化动态合并视觉编码器深层中的token。

Result: 在ImageNet和CLIP预训练中显著减少GFLOP，同时保持分类/零样本性能。

Conclusion: DRIP方法在科学领域的大规模生物学数据集上也验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下复杂环境和浑浊水域中车辆感知与操作的挑战。

Method: 两阶段方法：先缩放相对深度图，再用Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer块优化。

Result: 在嵌入式硬件上以15 FPS运行，精度和泛化能力优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SPADE有望支持实际水下检测和干预任务。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的激活方法，通过提取语义信息图（SIMs）和语义信息传播（SIP）生成更精确的激活图，显著提升了弱监督学习任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法仅突出目标的最具判别性区域，导致区域覆盖不全且边界不准确，限制了弱监督语义分割（WSSS）等任务的性能。

Method: Region-CAM通过结合梯度和特征，提取语义信息图并进行语义信息传播，生成覆盖更广且边界精确的激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和MS COCO数据集上，Region-CAM的mIoU分别提升了13.61%和16.23%，在ILSVRC2012的定位任务中表现优于LayerCAM。

Conclusion: Region-CAM通过改进激活图的生成方式，显著提升了弱监督学习任务的性能，尤其在覆盖范围和边界精度上表现优异。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available
at https://github.com/scu-zwh/TGBFN.

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more

Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应不同图像的独特类别分布，且受数据集类别不平衡影响，导致对少数类识别效果差。

Method: 利用记忆库学习数据集级上下文信息，结合图像级上下文动态调整分类器；采用教师-学生网络范式，教师网络通过真实标签动态更新上下文并传递知识给学生网络。

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态上下文调整有效解决了类别不平衡和图像独特分布问题，显著提升了语义分割效果。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

Abstract: In the contemporary landscape, the fusion of information technology and the
rapid advancement of artificial intelligence have ushered school education into
a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its
significance. Amidst these developments, one pivotal facet of the online
education paradigm that warrants attention is the authentication of identities
within the digital learning sphere. Within this context, our study delves into
a solution for online learning authentication, utilizing an enhanced
convolutional neural network architecture, specifically the residual network
model. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this technological approach
aims to galvanize the ongoing progress of online education, while concurrently

educational landscape. This paper's focal proposition involves the deployment
of the YOLOv5 network, meticulously trained on our proprietary dataset. This
network is tasked with identifying individuals' faces culled from images
captured by students' open online cameras. The resultant facial information is
then channeled into the residual network to extract intricate features at a
deeper level. Subsequently, a comparative analysis of Euclidean distances
against students' face databases is performed, effectively ascertaining the
identity of each student.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of critical diseases can significantly improve patient
survival and reduce treatment costs. However, existing diagnostic techniques
are often costly, invasive, and inaccessible in low-resource regions. This
paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood
clots, and cardiopulmonary abnormalities. A fine-tuned MobileNetV2
convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin
lesion classification, achieving 89.3% accuracy, 91.6% sensitivity, and 88.2%
specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based

Method: 提出多步去噪路径和一致性感知损失，结合统计推理和几何一致性约束。

Result: 在点云去噪、上采样和图像去噪任务中优于现有无监督方法，接近监督方法效果。

Conclusion: U-CAN为无监督去噪提供了高效解决方案，且其约束可推广至2D领域。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过改进特征提取和交互，有效提升了表面法线估计的准确性。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Result: 在CIFAR-10上显著提升FID分数，减少生成数据需求，路径更直且避免饱和。

Conclusion: 新方法通过结合真实图像，显著提升生成质量和效率，同时保持真实图像分布。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Conclusion: 该方法在情感表达和唇同步质量上优于现有方法，为情感驱动的3D面部动画提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将视线物体检测和视线跟随分开处理，且依赖头部相关先验知识，限制了系统的联合优化和实际应用。

Method: GaTector+采用共享主干和特定块的特征提取器，嵌入头部检测分支和基于头部的注意力机制，并提出注意力监督机制和新的评价指标mSoC。

Result: 实验结果表明，GaTector+在多个基准数据集上有效提升了视线物体检测和视线跟随的性能。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过统一框架和优化机制，显著提升了任务性能，并提出了更敏感的评价指标。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Conclusion: PDA是一种高效且轻量的解决方案，适用于少样本目标检测任务。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决边缘设备上多模态推理中感知动态与模型执行之间的紧密耦合及模态间复杂依赖关系的问题。

Result: 在真实无人机多模态测试平台上，MMEdge显著降低了延迟并保持了高准确性。

Conclusion: MMEdge为资源受限的边缘设备提供了一种高效的多模态推理解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT填补了现有数据集的空白，推动了流媒体视频理解和推理能力的发展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Conclusion: 通过MDP框架和双曲空间表示，显著提升了半监督3D动作识别的性能，并加速了实际应用部署。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决冠状动脉钙化评分中标注数据不足的问题，探索预训练基础模型与传统分类器的结合。

Method: 使用放射组学特征和预训练模型（CT-FM和RadImageNet）提取特征，比较其性能。

Result: 放射组学模型在非对比扫描数据集上表现优于CNN嵌入模型（84%准确率，p<0.05）。

Conclusion: 放射组学方法在无专家标注的情况下仍能有效分类钙化评分。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力差，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据的问题。

Method: 提出CCMP，结合类特定提示和全局共享提示，通过全局类原型和客户端类先验自适应组合提示。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优于现有基线，适用于异构数据场景。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为高效且可泛化的联邦提示调优提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Conclusion: i-CIR和BASIC为组合图像检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动生成音频描述的方法通常独立生成每个描述，导致重复和不连贯。

Method: 生成多个候选描述，通过自回归选择形成连贯序列。

Result: CoherentAD生成的序列更具连贯性和叙事性，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoherentAD通过序列级选择和评估，显著提升了音频描述的质量。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Conclusion: 经典ResNet结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割中仍具竞争力，为临床肝肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Conclusion: RegionE通过区域感知生成显著提升指令图像编辑效率，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

Conclusion: Hawk通过空间结构引导显著提升自回归图像生成效率。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

Conclusion: FreeArt3D在质量和通用性上显著优于现有方法，且无需大规模数据集或特定任务训练。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

Conclusion: VFXMaster为VFX生成提供了高效、统一的解决方案，并计划发布代码、模型和数据集以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集中式AI面临计算瓶颈和收益递减，需要可扩展的推理层。

Method: 采用群体推理和声誉加权共识，结合Bradley-Terry模型进行排名。

Result: 在GPQA Diamond等基准测试中，性能提升17.21个百分点，抗攻击能力强。

Conclusion: Fortytwo为去中心化AI系统奠定基础，兼顾可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

Motivation: 探索弱到强泛化的具体机制，填补现有理论在具体模型（如CNN）中的空白。

Method: 使用梯度下降分析强模型在弱模型标注数据上的训练动态，考虑结构化数据和噪声。

Result: 数据稀缺时泛化通过良性过拟合或有害过拟合发生；数据丰富时早期通过标签校正泛化，但过度训练会降低性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化的机制依赖于数据特性，数据稀缺和丰富时表现不同，需注意过度训练的影响。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Motivation: 现有基准缺乏适应性景观的地形信息，限制了模型性能的深入解释和比较。

Method: GraphFLA从DNA、RNA、蛋白质等多样化的突变数据中构建适应性景观，并计算20个特征。

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

Method: 采用Tiny Machine Learning技术，在资源受限的微控制器（如ESP32-S3）上运行压缩的卷积神经网络（CNN），减少数据传输能耗。

Result: 实验表明，直接在设备上执行CNN推理并仅传输结果，能耗比传输原始图像数据降低五倍，模型压缩对精度影响较小。

Conclusion: 研究支持开发低能耗、自主运行的IoT环境监测应用，减少碳足迹。

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

Motivation: 现有OOD基准中ID与OOD性能的正相关可能掩盖了虚假相关性的问题，需更细致分析。

Method: 提出梯度方法OODSelect，识别语义一致的OOD子集，验证ID与OOD性能的关系。

Result: 在多个基准中发现OOD子集中存在ID与OOD性能负相关的情况，部分子集占比过半。

Conclusion: 聚合指标可能掩盖OOD鲁棒性的重要失败模式，需更细粒度分析。

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应多任务EEG分类器，用于快速诊断中风类型、严重程度和侧向性，通过GRU-TCN和DQN实现高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速准确的中风诊断需要床边可部署的工具，EEG有潜力但未被充分利用。

Method: 使用32通道EEG信号转换为功率谱密度特征，GRU-TCN预测中风类型、侧向性和严重程度，DQN实时调整决策阈值。

Result: 在UCLH数据集中，中风类型准确率达98.0%，严重程度和侧向性准确率均超过96%。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值调整提高了诊断性能，可视化工具增强了可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

Motivation: 传统主题模型（如LDA）难以整合辅助信息，限制了表达能力和个性化。

Method: 提出nnLDA，利用神经先验机制动态生成主题比例的先验分布，结合随机变分EM算法优化。

Result: 在多个数据集上，nnLDA在主题一致性、困惑度和分类任务上优于LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归。

Conclusion: 结合神经网络和概率主题模型能有效利用辅助信息，提升模型性能。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

Result: 在多种架构下，KAN-GCN优于纯GCN和MLP-GCN基线，且在粗网格上推理速度更快。

Conclusion: KAN-first设计在精度和效率之间取得了良好平衡，适用于大规模瞬态场景扫描。

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

Method: 使用双GCN编码器和加权三元组损失的引导学习框架。

Result: 在真实数据集上表现优异，加权预训练效果显著。

Conclusion: 加权非对比学习在二分图归纳链接预测中具有重要价值。

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

Motivation: 验证LLMs生成的CoT是否真实反映其内部推理过程，评估推理步骤对预测的实际贡献。

Method: 提出TTS量化推理步骤的因果影响，识别TrueThinking方向并通过调控该方向强制LLMs执行或忽略特定步骤。

Result: 仅少数推理步骤（如AIME数据集中平均2.3%）具有高TTS，且自我验证步骤也可能是装饰性的。

Conclusion: LLMs常虚假表达推理步骤，影响推理效率和CoT的可信度。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了多模态表征的内部组织，为理解VLMs的文化处理机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

Conclusion: 论文提出的低秩结构抽象不仅与实验一致，还提供了可证明的学习保证，为语言模型研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法在处理构象不确定性时存在局限，无法有效分离构象不确定性和认知不确定性。

Method: 引入RCC框架，通过为每个排名构象分配深度神经网络委员会，实现两种不确定性的分离。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2抗体对接中表现优于基线策略。

Conclusion: RCC框架为治疗性抗体发现提供了可扩展的解决方案，并直接解决了构象不确定性建模的挑战。

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

<details>

Motivation: 数据量激增导致机器学习模型训练计算成本上升，许多特征对模型性能无贡献却消耗大量资源。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少计算量，同时保持预测性能。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模机器学习的计算挑战提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

*Ximan Sun,Xiang Cheng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LRT-Diffusion是一种风险感知的采样规则，通过假设检验控制风险预算，提升离线强化学习中扩散策略的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散策略在离线强化学习中表现优异，但缺乏统计意义上的风险控制。LRT-Diffusion旨在通过风险校准的采样规则解决这一问题。

Method: 利用对数似然比进行假设检验，通过逻辑控制器调整条件均值，保持训练结构不变（DDPM）。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务中，LRT-Diffusion在保持风险预算的同时，提升了性能与分布外泛化的权衡。

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion是一种即插即用的推理方法，为扩散策略提供了校准的风险控制。

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合实时癫痫发作检测和预测的新方法，利用多种机器学习算法和LSTM网络，在CHB-MIT头皮EEG数据库上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法仅在癫痫发作后检测，限制了早期干预的机会。本研究旨在通过实时检测和预测，实现更主动的治疗。

Method: 使用K近邻、逻辑回归、随机森林和支持向量机进行发作检测，LSTM网络进行发作预测。

Result: 逻辑回归检测准确率90.9%，召回率89.6%；LSTM预测准确率89.26%。随机森林和支持向量机准确率高但召回率为0。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了开发实时监测工具的潜力，能够从被动管理转向主动预测，帮助患者提前采取措施。

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Motivation: 解决HRL中自主发现语义子目标和学习最优选项终止边界的挑战。

Method: 集成自监督Transformer的CPD模块到Option-Critic框架，利用启发式伪标签训练CPD模块，并通过变更点优化终止函数梯度和策略学习。

Result: 在Four-Rooms和Pinball任务中，CPD引导的代理表现出更快的收敛速度、更高的累积回报和更好的选项专业化。

Conclusion: 通过变更点分割整合结构先验，可以在复杂环境中实现更高效、可解释和鲁棒的分层策略。

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex
environments.

Motivation: 探究矩阵白化优化器性能优势的来源，特别是方差适应对其的影响。

Method: 通过实验比较不同矩阵白化优化器及其变体，分析谱归一化和方差适应的作用。

Result: 方差适应是性能提升的关键，低秩方差估计能有效降低内存成本且不影响性能。

Conclusion: 矩阵白化优化器的性能优势主要来自方差适应，而非仅谱归一化。

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

Conclusion: SPIRE是分析刺激下多区域神经动态的实用、可重复工具。

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

Conclusion: 协议感知特征选择和受控模型研究可有效预测分布偏移下的模型行为，为开发鲁棒的放射组学模型提供了框架。

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

Method: DWMGrad基于传统方法，引入依赖历史数据的动态指导机制，动态更新动量和学习率，以适应不同训练场景。

Result: 实验表明，DWMGrad在多场景下能实现更快的收敛速度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: DWMGrad通过动态调整机制，显著提升了优化算法在复杂任务中的适应性和性能。

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible

existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable

black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

Conclusion: PESO通过近端正则化有效解决了推荐系统中LoRA持续学习的挑战，平衡了适应与保留的需求。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

Motivation: GNN在处理关系数据时可能放大训练数据中的偏见，现有方法通常将偏见视为单一来源，忽略了属性和结构的不同影响，导致公平性和效用之间的权衡不佳。

Method: FairMIB通过对比学习最大化跨视角互信息，结合多视角条件信息瓶颈目标，平衡任务效用和公平性，并使用逆概率加权邻接校正减少偏见传播。

Result: 在五个真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，FairMIB在效用和公平性指标上均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: FairMIB通过多视角分解和互信息优化，有效减少了GNN中的偏见传播，同时保持了任务性能。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Conclusion: 分布偏移可以是有益的，尤其是在混合分布或技能组合的情境中。

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Motivation: 传统神经网络基于欧几里得参数空间，缺乏几何结构的显式建模。NDM旨在通过微分流形和黎曼几何提升网络的几何解释性和性能。

Method: NDM由三个协同层组成：坐标层（实现平滑坐标变换）、几何层（动态生成流形度量）和演化层（通过双目标损失优化任务性能和几何简洁性）。

Result: NDM通过几何正则化减少过度曲率和体积失真，提升泛化和鲁棒性，同时支持自然梯度下降和几何解释性。

Conclusion: NDM代表了深度学习向几何结构化、可解释和高效系统的根本转变，尽管仍存在计算挑战。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据的降维方法，适用于双曲波传播的物理数据，利用低秩神经表示（LRNR）架构，证明了高效表示的存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对双曲波传播的物理数据，寻找高效的降维方法。

Method: 使用低秩神经表示（LRNR）架构，结合深度学习技术，直接从数据中学习低维表示。

Result: 训练后的LRNR自然产生低秩张量表示，揭示了可解释的物理特征分解。

Conclusion: LRNR架构通过压缩方案实现高效推理，适用于高性能场景。

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

TL;DR: BRIDGE是一个统一的端到端架构，结合序列编码器和图神经网络（GNN），通过TOKENXATTN层实现细粒度的令牌级消息传递，在友谊预测和欺诈检测任务中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的数据集通常是序列和关系数据的结合，现有方法往往忽略其中一种模态。作者认为序列和图是同一数据集的两个互补方面，应联合学习。

Method: BRIDGE架构将序列编码器与GNN耦合，通过单一目标实现端到端训练，并引入TOKENXATTN层实现令牌级的邻居间消息传递。

Result: 在友谊预测（Brightkite）和欺诈检测（Amazon）任务中，BRIDGE在排名和分类指标上均优于静态GNN、时序图方法和纯序列基线。

Conclusion: BRIDGE通过联合学习序列和图模态，证明了其在处理复杂数据集时的有效性，为多模态学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将数据增强（DA）与因果推断结合的统一框架，用于干预下的泛化，并引入IV-like回归以减少混杂偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统DA仅适用于i.i.d.设置，而IVs在实际中不易获取，因此探索DA在因果推断中的潜在作用。

Method: 通过将DA视为对治疗生成机制的干预，并引入IV-like回归来正则化IV估计器。

Result: 理论和实验表明，该方法能有效减少混杂偏差，提升因果估计和泛化性能。

Conclusion: DA可作为IV的替代工具，在干预下提升模型性能，尤其在有限样本和真实数据中表现优越。

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

Result: 提出了一种简单有效的方法，能够缓解视觉表示的退化并提高对分布外（OOD）场景的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 研究明确了动作微调与视觉表示退化之间的权衡，并提出了恢复视觉-语言能力的实用方法。

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

Method: 通过线性嫁接非线性激活函数，消除主导的近似误差，提出了一种Lipschitz感知的线性嫁接方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能够收紧局部Lipschitz常数，并提高认证鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 线性嫁接通过减少近似误差，有效提升了认证鲁棒性，且无需认证训练。

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于快速解决优化电力线路断电（OPS）问题，以减少野火风险并减少负荷削减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OPS问题是计算复杂的混合整数线性规划（MILP），需要快速频繁解决。由于不同实例间存在共享结构，机器学习可以用于利用这些模式。

Method: 开发了一种ML引导的框架，结合领域知识（如线路通电和断电数量），扩展了现有的ML引导MILP解决方法。

Result: 在加州大型合成测试系统上，ML引导方法比传统优化方法更快地生成高质量解决方案。

Conclusion: ML引导方法在解决OPS问题时表现出高效性和实用性，优于传统方法。

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度模型在时间序列预测中容易因噪声和异常导致过拟合，传统方法对所有时间步无差别优化，无法区分可泛化和不可泛化的时间步。

Method: 采用双掩码机制（不确定性掩码和异常掩码）选择性计算MSE损失，避免学习不确定和异常时间步。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上验证，显著提升了Informer、TimesNet和iTransformer等模型的预测性能，MSE分别降低37.4%、8.4%和6.5%。

Conclusion: 选择性学习策略有效缓解了过拟合问题，提升了时间序列预测模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多类PU学习中无偏风险估计的挑战，提升性能和稳定性。

Method: 采用自适应损失加权，为正向和推断负向损失分配不同权重，确保目标风险的无偏估计。

Result: 在八个公开数据集上实验，显示在准确性和稳定性上均优于基线。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在多类PU学习中有效，实现了无偏风险估计和性能提升。

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BSFA框架通过区分处理Hessian矩阵的不同子空间更新，加速深度学习训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明，深度学习优化中存在Hessian矩阵的顶部特征方向（Dom-space）更新对损失减少贡献较小，而正交子空间（Bulk-space）更新更有效。

Method: 提出BSFA框架，通过PCA高效估计子空间，并采用块状策略进行局部处理。

Result: 在LLaMA-72M和LLaMA-134M预训练任务中，BSFA比AdamW快约2倍。

Conclusion: BSFA是一种高效且可扩展的优化框架，显著加速训练并保持稳定性。

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov

efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

Result: 理论证明IBNorm具有更高IB值和更紧的泛化界；实验显示其在语言和视觉模型中优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IBNorm在信息保留和稳定性上优于传统归一化方法。

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

Conclusion: 该算法成功解决了多目标强化学习问题，实现了回报最大化和状态分布分散的双重目标。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order
interactions, yet their theoretical underpinnings in semi-supervised learning
remain limited. We provide an asymptotic consistency analysis of variational
learning on random geometric hypergraphs, precisely characterizing the
conditions ensuring the well-posedness of hypergraph learning as well as
showing convergence to a weighted $p$-Laplacian equation. Motivated by this, we
propose Higher-Order Hypergraph Learning (HOHL), which regularizes via powers
of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

Conclusion: 论文证明了损失函数的凸性转换特性可被有效利用，提出的两阶段算法在实际任务中表现优越。

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物学建模面临多方面的挑战，如不确定的先验知识和复杂网络，这些挑战促使PIML向BIML进化。

Method: 提出BIML，基于四个支柱：不确定性量化、情境化、约束潜在结构推断和可扩展性。

Result: BIML为生物学建模提供了新的方法论框架。

Conclusion: BIML有望推动PIML在生物学领域的创新，并解决高科学和社会相关性的挑战。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

Conclusion: 为多算子学习的可扩展神经网络算子学习建立了统一的理论和实践基础。

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Result: 在多种黑盒优化基准测试中，GPTOpt表现优于传统优化器。

Conclusion: LLM具备高级数值推理能力，GPTOpt为无需参数调整的全局优化提供了灵活框架。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

Result: 实验表明，GWA能准确预测早期停止点、支持模型比较，并识别关键训练样本。

Conclusion: GWA提供了一种无需验证集的模型分析方法，直接从训练数据中获取泛化动态和样本贡献。

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,

cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

Conclusion: 新方法在概念解释的忠实性和一致性上表现更优，同时不影响模型性能。

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

Conclusion: QRNN展示了量子计算在序列学习中的潜力，为量子机器学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against

TL;DR: 该研究将Aurora深度学习模型应用于海洋表面温度预测，展示了其在降低计算成本的同时捕捉复杂时空模式的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统海洋预测方法计算成本高且扩展性有限，需要更高效的数据驱动方法。

Method: 通过高分辨率海洋再分析数据对Aurora模型进行微调，采用分阶段微调过程和纬度加权误差指标。

Result: 模型在RMSE（0.119K）和ACC（≈0.997）上表现优异，但沿海区域细节捕捉不足。

Conclusion: 研究表明跨领域预训练深度学习模型在海洋预测中的可行性，未来可通过增加变量和分辨率进一步提升性能。

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting
decision-making in environmental and economic sectors.

*Benjamin Leblanc,Pascal Germain*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PAC-Bayes框架通常用于随机采样的假设，本文提出了一种统一框架，可以从随机PAC-Bayesian保证中提取单个假设的保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决PAC-Bayes框架在需要部署单个确定性假设时的局限性。

Method: 提出统一框架，包括一般oracle边界、数值边界和多数投票特化。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在确定性分类器的泛化边界上优于基线（最高提升2倍）。

Conclusion: 该框架扩展了PAC-Bayes的实用性，适用于需要确定性预测的场景。

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

TL;DR: 论文研究了低秩伪逆在噪声环境下的谱范数鲁棒性，提出了改进的扰动边界，并验证了其在实际矩阵中的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的矩阵常受噪声影响，但低秩逆近似的谱范数鲁棒性尚未被充分理解，因此需要系统研究其扰动边界。

Method: 通过引入轮廓积分技术分析非整函数f(z)=1/z，推导出与特征间隙、谱衰减和噪声对齐相关的扰动边界。

Result: 提出的边界显著优于经典方法，误差预测更准确，且在实际和合成矩阵中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 研究为噪声计算环境中的低秩逆近似提供了实用的、频谱感知的保证。

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Orlicz几何结构的广义Sobolev IPM（GSI），通过Musielak正则化解决了计算难题，并在文档分类和拓扑数据分析中展示了高效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Sobolev IPM受限于$L^p$几何结构，无法融入其他几何先验。本文旨在通过Orlicz几何结构扩展其能力。

Method: 提出广义Sobolev IPM（GSI），利用Orlicz几何结构，并通过Musielak正则化简化计算为单变量优化问题。

Result: GSI-M计算效率显著高于流行的Orlicz-Wasserstein（OW），在文档分类和拓扑数据分析任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: GSI-M不仅保留了经典Sobolev IPM的特性，还能灵活融入多种几何先验，计算高效且实用性强。

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于SVD分解的结构化本地学习框架，用于训练深度神经网络，减少参数数量并保持与反向传播相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决反向传播（BP）的高内存和计算开销问题，以及直接反馈对齐（DFA）在深层架构中的可扩展性限制。

Method: 通过SVD分解权重矩阵，在低秩流形上进行本地学习，结合交叉熵、子空间对齐和正交正则化的复合损失函数。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上实现了与BP相当的准确性，同时减少了可训练参数数量。

Conclusion: 低秩流形上的本地学习是一种可扩展且高效的替代方案，适用于深度神经网络的训练。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于核评分规则的不确定性量化方法，用于回归任务，统一了多种已知度量，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 回归任务在安全关键领域需要准确的不确定性量化，但现有研究主要集中在分类任务上。

Method: 基于核评分规则设计了一族度量方法，涵盖总、偶然和认知不确定性，并通过核选择控制其行为特性。

Result: 实验表明，这些度量在下游任务中有效，并揭示了不同实例化之间的权衡（如鲁棒性和分布外检测性能）。

Conclusion: 该框架为任务特定的不确定性度量提供了理论指导和实用设计准则。

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

TL;DR: 论文系统比较了低精度浮点（FP）和整数（INT）量化在不同粒度下的性能，发现FP在粗粒度量化中表现优异，而INT在细粒度量化（如8位MXINT8）中更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI硬件普遍采用低精度FP格式处理LLM中的激活异常值，但缺乏对FP和INT量化在不同粒度下的统一比较，导致算法和硬件设计缺乏明确指导。

Method: 通过系统研究FP和INT格式的权衡，比较不同粒度和位宽的量化性能，并引入对称裁剪方法解决INT训练中的梯度偏差问题。

Result: 8位细粒度量化中MXINT8在算法精度和硬件效率上优于FP；4位量化中FP通常更优，但通过异常值缓解技术（如Hadamard旋转）NVINT4可超越NVFP4。

Conclusion: 研究表明，统一的FP方法并非最优，细粒度INT格式（如MXINT8）在未来AI加速器中能更好地平衡精度、功耗和效率。

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

Motivation: 传统WGAN框架在训练稳定性上存在不足，BOLT-GAN旨在通过BOLT原理改进这一问题。

Method: BOLT-GAN在WGAN基础上引入Lipschitz连续判别器，隐式最小化不同于Wasserstein距离的度量距离。

Result: 在CIFAR-10等四个基准测试中，BOLT-GAN的FID比WGAN低10-60%。

Conclusion: BOLT是一种广泛适用的原则，可有效提升GAN训练效果。

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在联邦学习中处理图数据时存在隐私风险或计算复杂度高的问题，FedLap旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 利用拉普拉斯平滑在谱域中捕获全局结构信息，避免交换敏感节点嵌入，从而保护隐私并提升可扩展性。

Result: FedLap在基准数据集上表现出与现有技术相当或更优的性能，同时提供强隐私保证。

Conclusion: FedLap是首个具有强隐私保证的子图联邦学习方案，为图数据联邦学习提供了高效且隐私安全的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解噪声或测量误差如何影响低秩近似，尤其是在谱范数下，对差分隐私低秩近似尤为重要。

Method: 通过改进经典的Eckart-Young-Mirsky定理，提出新的高概率谱范数扰动界限，并结合复分析中的轮廓自举方法。

Result: 在温和的特征间隙和范数条件下，新界限显著改善了谱误差估计，并在差分隐私PCA中提供了更强的实用性保证。

Conclusion: 新方法在理论和实证中均表现出色，为谱泛函分析提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

Motivation: 探索RNN如何生成自然环境中观察到的更丰富、自发且可能随机的行为，弥补过去对简单、确定性行为的研究不足。

Method: 通过训练RNN模拟HMM的发射统计，并逆向工程分析其机制，揭示噪声驱动动态和确定性转换的结构。

Result: 训练后的RNN表现出噪声维持的动态和模块化连接结构，能够实现概率计算。

Conclusion: RNN通过模块化重用相同的动态模式，可以模拟复杂的离散潜在动态，展示了其通用性和组合性。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

Result: 在50kHz脉冲激励的梁案例中，GNSS能准确模拟物理现象并泛化到未见载荷条件。

Conclusion: GNSS在保持时空保真度的同时显著加速推理，是动态波动结构模拟的有力替代方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Motivation: 传统RNN和SpikGRU在处理长序列或时空数据时丢失局部细节，需要更高效的模型。

Method: 提出CS-GRU，结合卷积操作和GRU门控机制，保留局部结构并提升时序精度。

Result: 在多个数据集上表现优异，平均提升4.35%，效率比SpikGRU高69%。

Conclusion: CS-GRU是一种高效且通用的时空数据处理框架。

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

*Ethan Harvey,Dennis Johan Loevlie,Michael C. Hughes*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了传统多实例学习（MIL）在医学影像中忽略相邻实例关系的局限性，并通过合成任务展示了其性能不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MIL方法在处理医学影像时独立处理实例，忽略了相邻实例间的上下文关系，这在真实应用中可能至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个合成分类任务，其中相邻实例的特征对准确预测至关重要，并对比了传统MIL方法与最优贝叶斯估计器的性能。

Result: 实证表明，即使新型相关MIL方法在大量实例上训练，仍难以达到最优泛化性能。

Conclusion: 传统和相关MIL方法在处理相邻实例关系时存在局限性，需进一步改进以充分利用上下文信息。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

TL;DR: NSFs通过条件归一化流直接学习SDE转移规律，显著提升采样速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在任意时间点采样时需昂贵数值求解器，NSFs旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 使用条件归一化流学习SDE转移规律，保留随机流特性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上，NSFs保持分布准确性，计算速度提升两个数量级。

Conclusion: NSFs在保持精度的同时大幅提升采样效率，适用于任意时间点采样。

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOUT是一种轻量级替代模型，用于直接从自主代理的潜在传感器表示预测场景覆盖标签，避免了昂贵的人工标注或计算密集型LVLM。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵的人工标注或计算密集型LVLM，难以大规模部署，因此需要一种高效且经济的替代方案。

Method: 通过蒸馏过程训练SCOUT模型，学习近似LVLM生成的覆盖标签，利用预计算感知特征避免冗余计算。

Result: 在真实自主导航场景的大规模数据集上验证，SCOUT在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: SCOUT为大规模场景覆盖分析提供了高效实用的替代方案，是自主系统场景覆盖监督的重要进展。

Abstract: Assessing scenario coverage is crucial for evaluating the robustness of
autonomous agents, yet existing methods rely on expensive human annotations or
computationally intensive Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). These
approaches are impractical for large-scale deployment due to cost and
efficiency constraints. To address these shortcomings, we propose SCOUT
(Scenario Coverage Oversight and Understanding Tool), a lightweight surrogate
model designed to predict scenario coverage labels directly from an agent's
latent sensor representations. SCOUT is trained through a distillation process,
learning to approximate LVLM-generated coverage labels while eliminating the
need for continuous LVLM inference or human annotation. By leveraging
precomputed perception features, SCOUT avoids redundant computations and
enables fast, scalable scenario coverage estimation. We evaluate our method
across a large dataset of real-life autonomous navigation scenarios,
demonstrating that it maintains high accuracy while significantly reducing
computational cost. Our results show that SCOUT provides an effective and
practical alternative for large-scale coverage analysis. While its performance
depends on the quality of LVLM-generated training labels, SCOUT represents a
major step toward efficient scenario coverage oversight in autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 预测处理是一种通用且可扩展的计算原理，为开发灵活、鲁棒的护理机器人提供了理论基础，同时揭示了人脑灵活适应的机制。

Abstract: The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care
robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on
handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse
scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the
human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which
underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory
signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal
recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the
free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional
visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was
able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and
flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We
demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent
dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,
and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through
visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in
multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on
repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest
reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.
Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish
predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,
pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while
offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible
adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为非侵入式校准提供了有效解决方案，未来可进一步优化。

Abstract: Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and
efficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward
kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally
generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving
platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths
connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the
difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method.
The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using
Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1
developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based
calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational
upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used
their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted
three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve
the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution
digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving
platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any
additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the
hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves
multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position
and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The
Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations
are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses.
Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable
enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further
improvements.

Abstract: Swarms evolving from collective behaviors among multiple individuals are
commonly seen in nature, which enables biological systems to exhibit more
efficient and robust collaboration. Creating similar swarm intelligence in
engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms
that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played
an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot
swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and
robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a
tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot
swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component
is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which
improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times.
Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale
increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the
mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area
coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding
industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo
transportation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型在资源受限的边缘设备上部署困难，计算需求高，难以满足实时性和功耗要求。

Method: 1. 视觉与语言输入后期融合；2. 长短期动作分块；3. 动态路由分配计算资源。

Result: NanoVLA在边缘设备上推理速度提升52倍，参数减少98%，同时保持或超越任务精度和泛化能力。

Conclusion: NanoVLA通过创新设计实现了在资源受限硬件上的高效、高精度机器人操作。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have significantly advanced robotic
manipulation by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), and action decoders
into a unified architecture. However, their deployment on resource-constrained
edge devices, such as mobile robots or embedded systems (e.g., Jetson Orin
Nano), remains challenging due to high computational demands, especially in
real-world scenarios where power, latency, and computational resources are
critical. To close this gap, we introduce Nano-scale Vision-Language Action
(NanoVLA), a family of lightweight VLA architectures that achieve high
performance with minimal resources. Our core innovations include: (1)
vision-language decoupling that moves conventional early vision and language
inputs fusion in VLM to late stage, achieving better performance while enabling
caching and reduce inference overhead and latency; (2) long-short action
chunking to ensure smooth, coherent multi-step planning without sacrificing
real-time responsiveness; (3) dynamic routing that adaptively assigns
lightweight or heavy backbones based on task complexity, further optimizing
inference efficiency. Experimental results on several benchmarks, as well as
real-world deployments, demonstrate that NanoVLA achieves up to 52x faster
inference on edge devices compared to previous state-of-the-art VLA models,
with 98% less parameters while maintaining or surpassing their task accuracy
and generalization. Ablation studies confirm that our decoupling strategy
preserves cross-task transferability, and the routing module enhances
cost-performance trade-offs, enabling practical, high-precision robotic
manipulation on resource-constrained hardware.

Motivation: 现有方法常忽视对象间的空间关系，导致操作顺序不当引发碰撞或阻塞。OrderMind旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 结合空间上下文编码器和时间优先级结构模块，构建空间图以聚合几何信息，并通过视觉语言模型生成监督信号。

Result: 在包含163,222个样本的基准测试中，OrderMind在仿真和现实环境中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OrderMind通过空间感知的优先级学习，实现了在杂乱场景中高效且鲁棒的操纵。

Abstract: Manipulation in cluttered environments is challenging due to spatial
dependencies among objects, where an improper manipulation order can cause
collisions or blocked access. Existing approaches often overlook these spatial
relationships, limiting their flexibility and scalability. To address these
limitations, we propose OrderMind, a unified spatial-aware manipulation
ordering framework that directly learns object manipulation priorities based on
spatial context. Our architecture integrates a spatial context encoder with a
temporal priority structuring module. We construct a spatial graph using
k-Nearest Neighbors to aggregate geometric information from the local layout
and encode both object-object and object-manipulator interactions to support
accurate manipulation ordering in real-time. To generate physically and
semantically plausible supervision signals, we introduce a spatial prior
labeling method that guides a vision-language model to produce reasonable
manipulation orders for distillation. We evaluate OrderMind on our Manipulation
Ordering Benchmark, comprising 163,222 samples of varying difficulty. Extensive
experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms prior approaches in effectiveness and
efficiency, enabling robust manipulation in cluttered scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言导航（VLN）方法主要针对地面机器人，难以推广到需要3D空间推理的无人机任务。此外，大型视觉语言模型（如GPT和Claude）缺乏空间基础，无法直接用于导航。

Method: SoraNav通过将几何先验融入图像标注来约束VLM动作空间，并采用混合切换策略结合VLM推理和基于几何的探索，避免死胡同和重复访问。

Result: 在2.5D场景中，成功率（SR）提升25.7%，路径长度加权成功率（SPL）提升17%；在3D场景中，SR提升29.5%，SPL提升18.5%。

Conclusion: SoraNav通过结合VLM推理和几何感知决策，显著提升了无人机在复杂环境中的导航性能。

Abstract: Interpreting visual observations and natural language instructions for
complex task execution remains a key challenge in robotics and AI. Despite
recent advances, language-driven navigation is still difficult, particularly
for UAVs in small-scale 3D environments. Existing Vision-Language Navigation
(VLN) approaches are mostly designed for ground robots and struggle to
generalize to aerial tasks that require full 3D spatial reasoning. The
emergence of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as GPT and Claude,
enables zero-shot semantic reasoning from visual and textual inputs. However,
these models lack spatial grounding and are not directly applicable to
navigation. To address these limitations, SoraNav is introduced, an adaptive
UAV navigation framework that integrates zero-shot VLM reasoning with
geometry-aware decision-making. Geometric priors are incorporated into image
annotations to constrain the VLM action space and improve decision quality. A
hybrid switching strategy leverages navigation history to alternate between VLM
reasoning and geometry-based exploration, mitigating dead-ends and redundant
revisits. A PX4-based hardware-software platform, comprising both a digital
twin and a physical micro-UAV, enables reproducible evaluation. Experimental
results show that in 2.5D scenarios, our method improves Success Rate (SR) by
25.7% and Success weighted by Path Length (SPL) by 17%. In 3D scenarios, it
improves SR by 29.5% and SPL by 18.5% relative to the baseline.

Abstract: It's important to monitor road issues such as bumps and potholes to enhance
safety and improve road conditions. Smartphones are equipped with various
built-in sensors that offer a cost-effective and straightforward way to assess
road quality. However, progress in this area has been slow due to the lack of
high-quality, standardized datasets. This paper discusses a new dataset created
by a mobile app that collects sensor data from devices like GPS,
accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, gravity sensors, and orientation
sensors. This dataset is one of the few that integrates Geographic Information
System (GIS) data with weather information and video footage of road
conditions, providing a comprehensive understanding of road issues with
geographic context. The dataset allows for a clearer analysis of road
conditions by compiling essential data, including vehicle speed, acceleration,
rotation rates, and magnetic field intensity, along with the visual and spatial
context provided by GIS, weather, and video data. Its goal is to provide
funding for initiatives that enhance traffic management, infrastructure
development, road safety, and urban planning. Additionally, the dataset will be
publicly accessible to promote further research and innovation in smart
transportation systems.

Result: 在高达90%遮挡的手持视频序列中，跟踪误差低于2像素，满足实时机器人视觉应用需求。

Conclusion: 该框架在遮挡条件下表现出鲁棒性和低延迟精度，适用于实际机器人视觉应用。

Abstract: Vision-based control systems, such as image-based visual servoing (IBVS),
have been extensively explored for precise robot manipulation. A persistent
challenge, however, is maintaining robust target tracking under partial or full
occlusions. Classical methods like Lucas-Kanade (LK) offer lightweight tracking
but are fragile to occlusion and drift, while deep learning-based approaches
often require continuous visibility and intensive computation. To address these
gaps, we propose a hybrid visual tracking framework that bridges advanced
perception with real-time servo control. First, a fast global template matcher
constrains the pose search region; next, a deep-feature Lucas-Kanade module
operating on early VGG layers refines alignment to sub-pixel accuracy (<2px);
then, a lightweight residual regressor corrects local misalignments caused by
texture degradation or partial occlusion. When visual confidence falls below a
threshold, a GRU-based predictor seamlessly extrapolates pose updates from
recent motion history. Crucially, the pipeline's final outputs-translation,
rotation, and scale deltas-are packaged as direct control signals for 30Hz
image-based servo loops. Evaluated on handheld video sequences with up to 90%
occlusion, our system sustains under 2px tracking error, demonstrating the
robustness and low-latency precision essential for reliable real-world robot
vision applications.

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了训练样本需求，同时保持了高性能。

Abstract: Whole-body humanoid motion represents a cornerstone challenge in robotics,
integrating balance, coordination, and adaptability to enable human-like
behaviors. However, existing methods typically require multiple training
samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human
motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a
single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking
motions. The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to
compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by
interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons,
which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to
the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy
training via reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap
dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines,
achieving superior performance across metrics. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

Abstract: Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 传统方法需为不同环境设计不同步态和控制器切换，复杂且不灵活，因此提出统一控制方案。

Method: 基于隐式-显式控制哲学，设计机器人身体结构，开发三种腿部结构，评估其在水陆环境中的移动性能。

Result: 实验证实存在一种腿部结构能在统一控制下适应水陆环境，以滑移率和能耗为指标。

Conclusion: 研究成功实现了一种简单控制方案下多环境适应的机器人设计。

Abstract: Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain
environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility,
and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating
between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy
employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait
for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits
for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller
switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research
develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and
terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the
implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's
body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible
joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg
structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper
evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three
developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy
consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the
existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic
and terrestrial environments under identical control.

Abstract: In this paper, an approach for gait assistance with a lower body exoskeleton
is described. Two concepts, transparency and motion assistance, are combined.
The transparent mode, where the system is following the user's free motion with
a minimum of perceived interaction forces, is realized by exploiting the gear
backlash of the actuation units. During walking a superimposed assistance mode
applies an additional torque guiding the legs to their estimated future
position. The concept of adaptive oscillators is utilized to learn the
quasi-periodic signals typical for locomotion. First experiments showed
promising results.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于龙门机器人类设备，且具有成本低、便携性强的优势。

Abstract: In this paper a new method for geometric robot calibration is introduced,
which uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between its
measuring points. The relative measurement between two points on the
calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the
system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker
or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically
robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to
its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical
description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters
are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least
squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The
functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to
promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The
modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry
machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.

Abstract: This survey provides an analysis of current methodologies integrating legal
and logical specifications into the perception, prediction, and planning
modules of automated driving systems. We systematically explore techniques
ranging from logic-based frameworks to computational legal reasoning
approaches, emphasizing their capability to ensure regulatory compliance and
interpretability in dynamic and uncertain driving environments. A central
finding is that significant challenges arise at the intersection of perceptual
reliability, legal compliance, and decision-making justifiability. To
systematically analyze these challenges, we introduce a taxonomy categorizing
existing approaches by their theoretical foundations, architectural
implementations, and validation strategies. We particularly focus on methods
that address perceptual uncertainty and incorporate explicit legal norms,
facilitating decisions that are both technically robust and legally defensible.
The review covers neural-symbolic integration methods for perception,
logic-driven rule representation, and norm-aware prediction strategies, all
contributing toward transparent and accountable autonomous vehicle operation.
We highlight critical open questions and practical trade-offs that must be
addressed, offering multidisciplinary insights from engineering, logic, and law
to guide future developments in legally compliant autonomous driving systems.

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少易碎物体损伤，实现温和操作，优于传统强化学习策略。

Abstract: Robotic manipulation of deformable and fragile objects presents significant
challenges, as excessive stress can lead to irreversible damage to the object.
While existing solutions rely on accurate object models or specialized sensors
and grippers, this adds complexity and often lacks generalization. To address
this problem, we present a vision-based reinforcement learning approach that
incorporates a stress-penalized reward to discourage damage to the object
explicitly. In addition, to bootstrap learning, we incorporate offline
demonstrations as well as a designed curriculum progressing from rigid proxies
to deformables. We evaluate the proposed method in both simulated and
real-world scenarios, showing that the policy learned in simulation can be
transferred to the real world in a zero-shot manner, performing tasks such as
picking up and pushing tofu. Our results show that the learned policies exhibit
a damage-aware, gentle manipulation behavior, demonstrating their effectiveness
by decreasing the stress applied to fragile objects by 36.5% while achieving
the task goals, compared to vanilla RL policies.

Motivation: 静态编队形状在环境信息变化时无法最小化原始成本函数，导致性能下降。

Method: 两阶段优化：先估计非线性、不可微成本，再用替代成本函数优化机器人相对位置。

Result: 模拟显示，编队规划器能显著降低单一成本（75%）和多种成本（20-40%）。

Conclusion: 编队规划通过近似原始成本函数的替代函数，比依赖形状抽象更有效。

Abstract: Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by
encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing
complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining
the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or
Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation.
When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a
static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose
a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost
function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation
planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative
robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear
and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions.
We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do
not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized
using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are
realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's
direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for
military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations,
we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When
minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation
planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning
provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that
closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape
abstraction.

Result: 模型通过仿真验证，并与传统哈密顿方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 提出的牛顿-欧拉模型有效描述了移动质量驱动器的动力学行为，为水下车辆控制提供了新方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of
motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator.
Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the
manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen
(1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and
included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the
coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal
effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived
using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through
simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass
actuator formulation.

Conclusion: 章鱼伸展运动非纯被动鞭状行为，水环境对其形成至关重要，为生物运动研究提供新视角。

Abstract: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing
attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous
studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying
principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether
whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features
observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences.
Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while
systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based
quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor
speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus
reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than
exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus
reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of
propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding
medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new
perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential
platform for future hydrodynamic research.

Result: 在两个挑战性TAMP领域实验中，显著减少规划时间，甚至完全消除失败。

Conclusion: VIZ-COAST通过提前识别问题，提高了任务和运动规划的效率和泛化能力。

Abstract: In task and motion planning, high-level task planning is done over an
abstraction of the world to enable efficient search in long-horizon robotics
problems. However, the feasibility of these task-level plans relies on the
downward refinability of the abstraction into continuous motion. When a
domain's refinability is poor, task-level plans that appear valid may
ultimately fail during motion planning, requiring replanning and resulting in
slower overall performance. Prior works mitigate this by encoding refinement
issues as constraints to prune infeasible task plans. However, these approaches
only add constraints upon refinement failure, expending significant search
effort on infeasible branches. We propose VIZ-COAST, a method of leveraging the
common-sense spatial reasoning of large pretrained Vision-Language Models to
identify issues with downward refinement a priori, bypassing the need to fix
these failures during planning. Experiments on two challenging TAMP domains
show that our approach is able to extract plausible constraints from images and
domain descriptions, drastically reducing planning times and, in some cases,
eliminating downward refinement failures altogether, generalizing to a diverse
range of instances from the broader domain.

Conclusion: 分层框架结合技能规划和调度，有效解决了双手操作的复杂协调问题。

Abstract: Long-horizon contact-rich bimanual manipulation presents a significant
challenge, requiring complex coordination involving a mixture of parallel
execution and sequential collaboration between arms. In this paper, we
introduce a hierarchical framework that frames this challenge as an integrated
skill planning & scheduling problem, going beyond purely sequential
decision-making to support simultaneous skill invocation. Our approach is built
upon a library of single-arm and bimanual primitive skills, each trained using
Reinforcement Learning (RL) in GPU-accelerated simulation. We then train a
Transformer-based planner on a dataset of skill compositions to act as a
high-level scheduler, simultaneously predicting the discrete schedule of skills
as well as their continuous parameters. We demonstrate that our method achieves
higher success rates on complex, contact-rich tasks than end-to-end RL
approaches and produces more efficient, coordinated behaviors than traditional
sequential-only planners.

Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention, with most

considers energy consumption in the path planning of automated guided vehicles

Conclusion: 实时系统能够组合长时程行为，但存在对特定演示者的过拟合问题。

Abstract: We adapt a pre-trained Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model (Open-VLA) for
dexterous human-robot collaboration with minimal language prompting. Our
approach adds (i) FiLM conditioning to visual backbones for task-aware
perception, (ii) an auxiliary intent head that predicts collaborator hand pose
and target cues, and (iii) action-space post-processing that predicts compact
deltas (position/rotation) and PCA-reduced finger joints before mapping to full
commands. Using a multi-view, teleoperated Franka and Mimic-hand dataset
augmented with MediaPipe hand poses, we demonstrate that delta actions are
well-behaved and that four principal components explain ~96% of hand-joint
variance. Ablations identify action post-processing as the primary performance
driver; auxiliary intent helps, FiLM is mixed, and a directional motion loss is
detrimental. A real-time stack (~0.3 s latency on one RTX 4090) composes
"pick-up" and "pass" into a long-horizon behavior. We surface "trainer
overfitting" to specific demonstrators as the key limitation.

Conclusion: 该模型为软体机器人在开放环境中的3D导航任务提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in
confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may
collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work,
we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length
of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension.
We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true
shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those
experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator
at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it
occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a
robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The
robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which
our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and
series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it
could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the
robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters
it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks.

Motivation: 当前机器人工具使用方法局限于单一对象，无法在多对象中选择最佳工具，限制了其通用性和问题解决能力。

Conclusion: GeT-USE通过几何知识学习，显著提升了机器人在多对象中选择和使用最佳工具的能力。

Abstract: The ability to use random objects as tools in a generalizable manner is a
missing piece in robots' intelligence today to boost their versatility and
problem-solving capabilities. State-of-the-art robotic tool usage methods
focused on procedurally generating or crowd-sourcing datasets of tools for a
task to learn how to grasp and manipulate them for that task. However, these
methods assume that only one object is provided and that it is possible, with
the correct grasp, to perform the task; they are not capable of identifying,
grasping, and using the best object for a task when many are available,
especially when the optimal tool is absent. In this work, we propose GeT-USE, a
two-step procedure that learns to perform real-robot generalized tool usage by
learning first to extend the robot's embodiment in simulation and then
transferring the learned strategies to real-robot visuomotor policies. Our key
insight is that by exploring a robot's embodiment extensions (i.e., building
new end-effectors) in simulation, the robot can identify the general tool
geometries most beneficial for a task. This learned geometric knowledge can
then be distilled to perform generalized tool usage tasks by selecting and
using the best available real-world object as tool. On a real robot with 22
degrees of freedom (DOFs), GeT-USE outperforms state-of-the-art methods by
30-60% success rates across three vision-based bimanual mobile manipulation
tool-usage tasks.

per trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the
previous baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0
averages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website:
