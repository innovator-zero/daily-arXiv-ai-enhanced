Current approaches either ignore these biases,\nleading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures\nthat are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal\nCombining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting\ntransformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform\nsolutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds.

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry.

We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks.

However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are\nfaced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the\nbug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which\nis not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit\nmessage frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information. They\nare also based on simple heuristics (e.g., assuming the BIC initializes lines\ndeleted in the patch) and lack any logical analysis of the vulnerability.\n  In this paper, we make the observation that Large Language Models (LLMs) are\nwell-positioned to break the barriers of existing solutions, e.g., comprehend\nboth textual data and code in patches and commits. Unlike previous BIC\nidentification approaches, which yield poor results, we propose a comprehensive\nmulti-stage pipeline that leverages LLMs to: (1) fully utilize patch\ninformation, (2) compare multiple candidate commits in context, and (3)\nprogressively narrow down the candidates through a series of down-selection\nsteps.

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.

Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture.

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering."}

This paper\nintroduces CYPRESS (Crop Yield Prediction via Regression on Prithvi's Encoder\nfor Satellite Sensing), a deep learning model designed for high-resolution,\nintra-field canola yield prediction. CYPRESS leverages a pre-trained,\nlarge-scale geospatial foundation model (Prithvi-EO-2.0-600M) and adapts it for\na continuous regression task, transforming multi-temporal satellite imagery\ninto dense, pixel-level yield maps. Evaluated on a comprehensive dataset from\nthe Canadian Prairies, CYPRESS demonstrates superior performance over existing\ndeep learning-based yield prediction models, highlighting the effectiveness of\nfine-tuning foundation models for specialized agricultural applications. By\nproviding a continuous, high-resolution output, CYPRESS offers a more\nactionable tool for precision agriculture than conventional classification or\ncounty-level aggregation methods. This work validates a novel approach that\nbridges the gap between large-scale Earth observation and on-farm\ndecision-making, offering a scalable solution for detailed agricultural\nmonitoring."}

LFI assumes an arbitrary support for sampling, which remains\nconstant as the initial generic prior is iteratively refined to more\ndescriptive posteriors. However, a potentially misspecified support can lead to\nsuboptimal, yet falsely certain, posteriors. To address this issue, we propose\nthree heuristic LFI variants: EDGE, MODE, and CENTRE. Each interprets the\nposterior mode shift over inference steps in its own way and, when integrated\ninto an LFI step, adapts the support alongside posterior inference. We first\nexpose the support misspecification issue and evaluate our heuristics using\nstochastic dynamical benchmarks. We then evaluate the impact of heuristic\nsupport adaptation on parameter inference and policy learning for a dynamic\ndeformable linear object (DLO) manipulation task. Inference results in a finer\nlength and stiffness classification for a parametric set of DLOs. When the\nresulting posteriors are used as domain distributions for sim-based policy\nlearning, they lead to more robust object-centric agent performance."}

Existing methods\nto model such dynamics typically rely on manually-defined or heuristic\nhierarchies with fixed motion primitives, limiting their generalizability\nacross different tasks. In this work, we propose a general hierarchical motion\nmodeling method that learns structured, interpretable motion relationships\ndirectly from data. Our method represents observed motions using graph-based\nhierarchies, explicitly decomposing global absolute motions into\nparent-inherited patterns and local motion residuals. We formulate hierarchy\ninference as a differentiable graph learning problem, where vertices represent\nelemental motions and directed edges capture learned parent-child dependencies\nthrough graph neural networks. We evaluate our hierarchical reconstruction\napproach on three examples: 1D translational motion, 2D rotational motion, and\ndynamic 3D scene deformation via Gaussian splatting. Experimental results show\nthat our method reconstructs the intrinsic motion hierarchy in 1D and 2D cases,\nand produces more realistic and interpretable deformations compared to the\nbaseline on dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting scenes. By providing an adaptable,\ndata-driven hierarchical modeling paradigm, our method offers a formulation\napplicable to a broad range of motion-centric tasks.

Standard image retrieval techniques are\ninefficient due to the sheer volume of images (>100M) and fail when coverage is\ninsufficient. Scalable solutions, however, involve a trade-off: global\nclassification typically yields coarse results (10+ kilometers), while\ncross-view retrieval between ground and aerial imagery suffers from a domain\ngap and has been primarily studied on smaller regions. This paper introduces a\nhybrid approach that achieves fine-grained geo-localization across a large\ngeographic expanse the size of a continent. We leverage a proxy classification\ntask during training to learn rich feature representations that implicitly\nencode precise location information. We combine these learned prototypes with\nembeddings of aerial imagery to increase robustness to the sparsity of\nground-level data. This enables direct, fine-grained retrieval over areas\nspanning multiple countries. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates that our\napproach can localize within 200m more than 68\\% of queries of a dataset\ncovering a large part of Europe.

In this work, we advance\nthis technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically\nbased rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to\nrepurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,\nand PBR materials.
