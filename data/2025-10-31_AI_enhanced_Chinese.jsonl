Unlike MLPs, which use fixed\nactivation functions on nodes, KANs employ learnable univariate basis functions\non edges, offering enhanced expressivity and interpretability. This review\nprovides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the rapidly expanding KAN\nlandscape, moving beyond simple performance comparisons to offer a structured\nsynthesis of theoretical foundations, architectural variants, and practical\nimplementation strategies. By collecting and categorizing a vast array of\nopen-source implementations, we map the vibrant ecosystem supporting KAN\ndevelopment. We begin by bridging the conceptual gap between KANs and MLPs,\nestablishing their formal equivalence and highlighting the superior parameter\nefficiency of the KAN formulation. A central theme of our review is the\ncritical role of the basis function; we survey a wide array of choices,\nincluding B-splines, Chebyshev and Jacobi polynomials, ReLU compositions,\nGaussian RBFs, and Fourier series, and analyze their respective trade-offs in\nterms of smoothness, locality, and computational cost. We then categorize\nrecent advancements into a clear roadmap, covering techniques for improving\naccuracy, efficiency, and regularization. Key topics include physics-informed\nloss design, adaptive sampling, domain decomposition, hybrid architectures, and\nspecialized methods for handling discontinuities. Finally, we provide a\npractical \"Choose-Your-KAN\" guide to help practitioners select appropriate\narchitectures, and we conclude by identifying current research gaps.

Current approaches either ignore these biases,\nleading to suboptimal decisions, or require expensive calibration procedures\nthat are often infeasible in practice. This performance gap has real\nconsequences: inaccurate environmental monitoring, unreliable financial\npredictions, and flawed aggregation of human judgments. This paper addresses\nthe fundamental question: when can we learn and correct for these unknown\nbiases to recover near-optimal performance, and when is such learning futile?\nWe develop a theoretical framework that decomposes biases into learnable\nsystematic components and irreducible stochastic components, introducing the\nconcept of learnability ratio as the fraction of bias variance predictable from\nobservable covariates. This ratio determines whether bias learning is\nworthwhile for a given system. We prove that the achievable performance\nimprovement is fundamentally bounded by this learnability ratio, providing\nsystem designers with quantitative guidance on when to invest in bias learning\nversus simpler approaches. We present the Adaptive Bias Learning and Optimal\nCombining (ABLOC) algorithm, which iteratively learns bias-correcting\ntransformations while optimizing combination weights through closedform\nsolutions, guaranteeing convergence to these theoretical bounds. Experimental\nvalidation demonstrates that systems with high learnability ratios can recover\nsignificant performance (we achieved 40%-70% of theoretical maximum improvement\nin our examples), while those with low learnability show minimal benefit,\nvalidating our diagnostic criteria for practical deployment decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08ABLOC\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5224\u65ad\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86ABLOC\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9ad8\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0840%-70%\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u5927\u6539\u8fdb\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u503c\u5f97\u6295\u8d44\u4e8e\u504f\u5dee\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

This service can\nreduce costs for both passengers and operators and reduce congestion and\nenvironmental impacts. A key limitation, however, is its myopic\ndecision-making, which overlooks long-term effects of dispatch decisions. To\naddress this, we propose a simulation-informed reinforcement learning (RL)\napproach. While RL has been widely studied in the context of ride-hailing\nsystems, its application in ride-pooling systems has been less explored. In\nthis study, we extend the learning and planning framework of Xu et al. (2018)\nfrom ride-hailing to ride-pooling by embedding a ride-pooling simulation within\nthe learning mechanism to enable non-myopic decision-making. In addition, we\npropose a complementary policy for rebalancing idle vehicles. By employing\nn-step temporal difference learning on simulated experiences, we derive\nspatiotemporal state values and subsequently evaluate the effectiveness of the\nnon-myopic policy using NYC taxi request data. Results demonstrate that the\nnon-myopic policy for matching can increase the service rate by up to 8.4%\nversus a myopic policy while reducing both in-vehicle and wait times for\npassengers. Furthermore, the proposed non-myopic policy can decrease fleet size\nby over 25% compared to a myopic policy, while maintaining the same level of\nperformance, thereby offering significant cost savings for operators.\nIncorporating rebalancing operations into the proposed framework cuts wait time\nby up to 27.3%, in-vehicle time by 12.5%, and raises service rate by 15.1%\ncompared to using the framework for matching decisions alone at the cost of\nincreased vehicle minutes traveled per passenger.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u62fc\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u62fc\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u73af\u5883\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u77ed\u89c6\u51b3\u7b56\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u62fc\u8f66\u6a21\u62df\u5d4c\u5165\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408n\u6b65\u65f6\u95f4\u5dee\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u5339\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7a7a\u95f2\u8f66\u8f86\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u975e\u77ed\u89c6\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u670d\u52a1\u7387\u63d0\u9ad88.4%\uff0c\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u8f66\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u51cf\u5c1125%\uff1b\u518d\u5e73\u8861\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7b49\u5f85\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u8f66\u5185\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u62fc\u8f66\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fd0\u8425\u5546\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, methods rooted in this\napproach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium\nattitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the\nattitude-error Euler axis larger than {\\pi}rad, their proportional-control\neffect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of\nthe CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude\ncontrol law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle\ninformation to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater\nflexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two\ndifferent control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict\nLyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique\nequilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly\nasymptotically stable.

However, conventional methods, such as\nclosed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection,\nseparate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and\nrequire dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting\nadaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these\nchallenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic\nincident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial\nperspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better\nlow-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep\nlearning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident\ndetection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected\ndataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity\nassessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a\nweb-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS\ndetected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local\ntransportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion\npropagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and\nenable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk.\nCrucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on\nfrequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and\ncost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings.\nThis study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated\nreal-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for\nthe operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation\nmanagement.", "AI": {"tldr": "DARTS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548cAI\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u4ea4\u901a\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u5dee\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u70ed\u70b9\u3002", "method": "DARTS\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u673a\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523099%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u524d12\u5206\u949f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "DARTS\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite their\nstrong generative capabilities, they face critical limitations in image editing\ntasks: inaccurate inversion processes for mapping real images back into the\nlatent space, and gradient entanglement issues during editing often result in\noutputs that do not faithfully reflect the target prompt. Recent efforts have\nattempted to directly map source and target distributions via ODE-based\napproaches without inversion; however,these methods still yield suboptimal\nediting quality. In this work, we propose a flow decomposition-and-aggregation\nframework built upon an inversion-free formulation to address these\nlimitations. Specifically, we semantically decompose the target prompt into\nmultiple sub-prompts, compute an independent flow for each, and aggregate them\nto form a unified editing trajectory. While we empirically observe that\ndecomposing the original flow enhances diversity in the target space,\ngenerating semantically aligned outputs still requires consistent guidance\ntoward the full target prompt. To this end, we design a projection and\nsoft-aggregation mechanism for flow, inspired by gradient conflict resolution\nin multi-task learning. This approach adaptively weights the sub-target\nvelocity fields, suppressing semantic redundancy while emphasizing distinct\ndirections, thereby preserving both diversity and consistency in the final\nedited output.

Kim"], "title": "PRESTO: Preimage-Informed Instruction Optimization for Prompting Black-Box LLMs", "comment": "Accepted to NeurIPS 2025", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse\ndomains, due to their strong instruction-following capabilities. This has led\nto increasing interest in optimizing instructions for black-box LLMs, whose\ninternal parameters are inaccessible but widely used due to their strong\nperformance. To optimize instructions for black-box LLMs, recent methods employ\nwhite-box LLMs to generate candidate instructions from optimized soft prompts.\nHowever, white-box LLMs often map different soft prompts to the same\ninstruction, leading to redundant queries. While previous studies regarded this\nmany-to-one mapping as a structure that hinders optimization efficiency, we\nreinterpret it as a useful prior knowledge that can accelerate the\noptimization. To this end, we introduce PREimage-informed inSTruction\nOptimization (PRESTO), a novel framework that leverages the preimage structure\nof soft prompts for efficient optimization. PRESTO consists of three key\ncomponents: (1) score sharing, which shares the evaluation score with all soft\nprompts in a preimage; (2) preimage-based initialization, which selects initial\ndata points that maximize search space coverage using preimage information; and\n(3) score consistency regularization, which enforces prediction consistency\nwithin each preimage. By leveraging preimages, PRESTO achieves the effect of\neffectively obtaining 14 times more scored data under the same query budget,\nresulting in more efficient optimization.

However, current E2E driving benchmarks primarily\nfeature nominal scenarios, failing to adequately test the true potential of\nthese systems. Furthermore, existing open-loop evaluation metrics often fall\nshort in capturing the multi-modal nature of driving or effectively evaluating\nperformance in long-tail scenarios. To address these gaps, we introduce the\nWaymo Open Dataset for End-to-End Driving (WOD-E2E). WOD-E2E contains 4,021\ndriving segments (approximately 12 hours), specifically curated for challenging\nlong-tail scenarios that that are rare in daily life with an occurring\nfrequency of less than 0.03%. Concretely, each segment in WOD-E2E includes the\nhigh-level routing information, ego states, and 360-degree camera views from 8\nsurrounding cameras. To evaluate the E2E driving performance on these long-tail\nsituations, we propose a novel open-loop evaluation metric: Rater Feedback\nScore (RFS). Unlike conventional metrics that measure the distance between\npredicted way points and the logs, RFS measures how closely the predicted\ntrajectory matches rater-annotated trajectory preference labels. We have\nreleased rater preference labels for all WOD-E2E validation set segments, while\nthe held out test set labels have been used for the 2025 WOD-E2E Challenge.\nThrough our work, we aim to foster state of the art research into\ngeneralizable, robust, and safe end-to-end autonomous driving agents capable of\nhandling complex real-world situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86WOD-E2E\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807RFS\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5e38\u89c4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u9a7e\u9a76\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u6216\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165WOD-E2E\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b4,021\u4e2a\u9a7e\u9a76\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u7f55\u89c1\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faRFS\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "WOD-E2E\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cRFS\u6307\u6807\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "conclusion": "WOD-E2E\u548cRFS\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose FullPart, a novel framework that\ncombines both implicit and explicit paradigms. It first derives the bounding\nbox layout through an implicit box vector-set diffusion process, a task that\nimplicit diffusion handles effectively since box tokens contain little\ngeometric detail. Then, it generates detailed parts, each within its own fixed\nfull-resolution voxel grid. Instead of sharing a global low-resolution space,\neach part in our method - even small ones - is generated at full resolution,\nenabling the synthesis of intricate details. We further introduce a\ncenter-point encoding strategy to address the misalignment issue when\nexchanging information between parts of different actual sizes, thereby\nmaintaining global coherence. Moreover, to tackle the scarcity of reliable part\ndata, we present PartVerse-XL, the largest human-annotated 3D part dataset to\ndate with 40K objects and 320K parts.

Existing\napproaches, from vision-language-action (VLA) models to hierarchical\nframeworks, fall short due to their reliance on limited or dividual-agent\nmemory. This fundamentally constrains their ability to learn over long\nhorizons, scale to heterogeneous teams, or recover from failures, highlighting\nthe need for a unified memory representation. To address these limitations, we\nintroduce RoboOS-NeXT, a unified memory-based framework for lifelong, scalable,\nand robust multi-robot collaboration. At the core of RoboOS-NeXT is the novel\nSpatio-Temporal-Embodiment Memory (STEM), which integrates spatial scene\ngeometry, temporal event history, and embodiment profiles into a shared\nrepresentation. This memory-centric design is integrated into a\nbrain-cerebellum framework, where a high-level brain model performs global\nplanning by retrieving and updating STEM, while low-level controllers execute\nactions locally. This closed loop between cognition, memory, and execution\nenables dynamic task allocation, fault-tolerant collaboration, and consistent\nstate synchronization. We conduct extensive experiments spanning complex\ncoordination tasks in restaurants, supermarkets, and households.

In this paper, we propose a strong baseline BasicAVSR\nfor AVSR by integrating four key components: 1) adaptive multi-scale frequency\npriors generated from image Laplacian pyramids, 2) a flow-guided propagation\nunit to aggregate spatiotemporal information from adjacent frames, 3) a\nsecond-order motion compensation unit for more accurate spatial alignment of\nadjacent frames, and 4) a hyper-upsampling unit to generate scale-aware and\ncontent-independent upsampling kernels. To meet diverse application demands, we\ninstantiate three propagation variants: (i) a unidirectional RNN unit for\nstrictly online inference, (ii) a unidirectional RNN unit empowered with a\nlimited lookahead that tolerates a small output delay, and (iii) a\nbidirectional RNN unit designed for offline tasks where computational resources\nare less constrained. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and\nadaptability of our model across these different scenarios.

In South Asian countries rickshaws are among the\nmost common means of local transport. Based on their mode of operation,\nrickshaws in cities across Bangladesh can be broadly classified into non-auto\n(pedal-powered) and auto-rickshaws (motorized). Monitoring the movement of\nauto-rickshaws is necessary as traffic rules often restrict auto-rickshaws from\naccessing certain routes. However, existing surveillance systems make it quite\ndifficult to monitor them due to their similarity to other vehicles, especially\nnon-auto rickshaws whereas manual video analysis is too time-consuming. This\npaper presents a machine learning-based approach to automatically detect\nauto-rickshaws in traffic images. In this system, we used real-time object\ndetection using the YOLOv8 model. For training purposes, we prepared a set of\n1,730 annotated images that were captured under various traffic conditions.

This study investigates the\neffect of knowledge distillation on the transferability of ``debiasing''\ncapabilities from teacher models to student models on natural language\ninference (NLI) and image classification tasks. Through extensive experiments,\nwe illustrate several key findings: (i) overall the debiasing capability of a\nmodel is undermined post-KD; (ii) training a debiased model does not benefit\nfrom injecting teacher knowledge; (iii) although the overall robustness of a\nmodel may remain stable post-distillation, significant variations can occur\nacross different types of biases; and (iv) we pin-point the internal attention\npattern and circuit that causes the distinct behavior post-KD. Given the above\nfindings, we propose three effective solutions to improve the distillability of\ndebiasing methods: developing high quality data for augmentation, implementing\niterative knowledge distillation, and initializing student models with weights\nobtained from teacher models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy on the effect of KD on debiasing and its interenal mechanism at scale.\nOur findings provide understandings on how KD works and how to design better\ndebiasing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff08KD\uff09\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0KD\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u53bb\u504f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53bb\u504f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790KD\u5bf9\u53bb\u504f\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f20\u9012\u6027\u3002", "result": "KD\u524a\u5f31\u53bb\u504f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86KD\u5bf9\u53bb\u504f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Furthermore, we show that concept activations produce\nspatial attributions that align with semantically meaningful image regions.\nConceptScope reliably detects known biases (e.g., background bias in\nWaterbirds) and uncovers previously unannotated ones (e.g, co-occurring objects\nin ImageNet), offering a practical tool for dataset auditing and model\ndiagnostics.", "AI": {"tldr": "ConceptScope\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u6790\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86ConceptScope\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u68c0\u6d4b\u5df2\u77e5\u548c\u672a\u77e5\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "ConceptScope\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5ba1\u8ba1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bca\u65ad\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Unlike conventional approaches that search\nfor optimal parameters within a fixed geometric space, our core idea is to\ntreat the model itself as a malleable geometric entity. Specifically, we\noptimize the metric tensor field on a manifold with a predefined topology,\nthereby dynamically shaping the geometric structure of the model space. To\nachieve this, we construct a variational framework whose loss function\ncarefully balances data fidelity against the intrinsic geometric complexity of\nthe manifold. The former ensures the model effectively explains observed data,\nwhile the latter acts as a regularizer, penalizing overly curved or irregular\ngeometries to encourage simpler models and prevent overfitting. To address the\ncomputational challenges of this infinite-dimensional optimization problem, we\nintroduce a practical method based on discrete differential geometry: the\ncontinuous manifold is discretized into a triangular mesh, and the metric\ntensor is parameterized by edge lengths, enabling efficient optimization using\nautomatic differentiation tools. Theoretical analysis reveals a profound\nanalogy between our framework and the Einstein-Hilbert action in general\nrelativity, providing an elegant physical interpretation for the concept of\n\"data-driven geometry\". We further argue that even with fixed topology, metric\noptimization offers significantly greater expressive power than models with\nfixed geometry.

HCP runs a short\nstochastic prefix up to an adaptive switch time, and then applies a one-step\nconsistency jump to produce the final action. To align this one-jump\ngeneration, HCP performs time-varying consistency distillation that combines a\ntrajectory-consistency objective to keep neighboring predictions coherent and a\ndenoising-matching objective to improve local fidelity. In both simulation and\non a real robot, HCP with 25 SDE steps plus one jump approaches the 80-step\nDDPM teacher in accuracy and mode coverage while significantly reducing\nlatency. These results show that multi-modality does not require slow\ninference, and a switch time decouples mode retention from speed. It yields a\npractical accuracy efficiency trade-off for robot policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "HCP\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u77ed\u968f\u673a\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u517c\u987e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHCP\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77ed\u968f\u673a\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8df3\u8dc3\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u84b8\u998f\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "HCP\u572825\u6b65SDE\u52a0\u4e00\u8df3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a5\u8fd180\u6b65DDPM\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "HCP\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u65e0\u9700\u6162\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u6001\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

However, traditional patch-based bisection methods are\nfaced with several significant barriers: For example, they assume that the\nbug-inducing commit (BIC) and the patch commit modify the same functions, which\nis not always true. They often rely solely on code changes, while the commit\nmessage frequently contains a wealth of vulnerability-related information.

While the Shortest Path First\n(SPF) algorithm is optimal for a single vehicle in a static network, it\nperforms poorly in dynamic, multi-vehicle settings, often worsening congestion\nby routing all vehicles along identical paths. We address dynamic vehicle\nrouting through a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for\ncoordinated, network-aware fleet navigation. We first propose Adaptive\nNavigation (AN), a decentralized MARL model where each intersection agent\nprovides routing guidance based on (i) local traffic and (ii) neighborhood\nstate modeled using Graph Attention Networks (GAT). To improve scalability in\nlarge networks, we further propose Hierarchical Hub-based Adaptive Navigation\n(HHAN), an extension of AN that assigns agents only to key intersections\n(hubs). Vehicles are routed hub-to-hub under agent control, while SPF handles\nmicro-routing within each hub region. For hub coordination, HHAN adopts\ncentralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) under the Attentive\nQ-Mixing (A-QMIX) framework, which aggregates asynchronous vehicle decisions\nvia attention. Hub agents use flow-aware state features that combine local\ncongestion and predictive dynamics for proactive routing. Experiments on\nsynthetic grids and real urban maps (Toronto, Manhattan) show that AN reduces\naverage travel time versus SPF and learning baselines, maintaining 100% routing\nsuccess. HHAN scales to networks with hundreds of intersections, achieving up\nto 15.9% improvement under heavy traffic.

This allows us to examine the performance of models for each individual\nstratum of the different attributes (e.g., the accuracy in every individual\ncountry). To demonstrate its importance, we utilize SAFE to benchmark a zoo of\nstate-of-the-art AI-based weather prediction models, finding that they all\nexhibit disparities in forecasting skill across every attribute. We use this to\nseed a benchmark of model forecast fairness through stratification at different\nlead times for various climatic variables. By moving beyond globally-averaged\nmetrics, we for the first time ask: where do models perform best or worst, and\nwhich models are most fair?

Under review as\n  a conference paper at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Image super-resolution(SR) is fundamental to many vision system-from\nsurveillance and autonomy to document analysis and retail analytics-because\nrecovering high-frequency details, especially scene-text, enables reliable\ndownstream perception. Scene-text, i.e., text embedded in natural images such\nas signs, product labels, and storefronts, often carries the most actionable\ninformation; when characters are blurred or hallucinated, optical character\nrecognition(OCR) and subsequent decisions fail even if the rest of the image\nappears sharp. Yet previous SR research has often been tuned to distortion\n(PSNR/SSIM) or learned perceptual metrics (LIPIS, MANIQA, CLIP-IQA, MUSIQ) that\nare largely insensitive to character-level errors. Furthermore, studies that do\naddress text SR often focus on simplified benchmarks with isolated characters,\noverlooking the challenges of text within complex natural scenes. As a result,\nscene-text is effectively treated as generic texture. For SR to be effective in\npractical deployments, it is therefore essential to explicitly optimize for\nboth text legibility and perceptual quality. We present GLYPH-SR, a\nvision-language-guided diffusion framework that aims to achieve both objectives\njointly.

However, the lack of dispersion between textual features can hurt\ncalibration performance, which raises concerns about VLMs' reliability,\ntrustworthiness, and safety. Current TPT approaches primarily focus on\nimproving prompt calibration by either maximizing average textual feature\ndispersion or enforcing orthogonality constraints to encourage angular\nseparation. However, these methods may not always have optimal angular\nseparation between class-wise textual features, which implies overlooking the\ncritical role of angular diversity. To address this, we propose A-TPT, a novel\nTPT framework that introduces angular diversity to encourage uniformity in the\ndistribution of normalized textual features induced by corresponding learnable\nprompts. This uniformity is achieved by maximizing the minimum pairwise angular\ndistance between features on the unit hypersphere. We show that our approach\nconsistently surpasses state-of-the-art TPT methods in reducing the aggregate\naverage calibration error while maintaining comparable accuracy through\nextensive experiments with various backbones on different datasets.

Secondly, the spine\nbones contain rich structural knowledge regarding their shapes and positions,\nwhich deserves to be encoded into the segmentation process. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel scale-adaptive structure-aware network\n(SA$^{2}$Net) for effective spine segmentation.

Unlike existing general video\nsummarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach\nemphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we\ndevelop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of\nvideo frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being\nselected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific\ndatasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of\n30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve,\nSpearman, and Kendall.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6458\u8981\u6280\u672f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u5e7f\u544a\u526a\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u97f3\u9891\u5728\u5e7f\u544a\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u542c\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5e7f\u544a\u526a\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u526a\u8f91\u89c6\u4e3a\u955c\u5934\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u542c\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5e27\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86AdSum204\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5e7f\u544a\u526a\u8f91\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

Existing FL frameworks face several limitations. Despite claiming to\nsupport architectural heterogeneity, most recent FL methods only tolerate\nvariants within a single model family (e.g., shallower, deeper, or wider CNNs),\nstill presuming a shared global architecture and failing to accommodate\nfederations where clients deploy fundamentally different network types (e.g.,\nCNNs, GNNs, MLPs). Moreover, existing approaches often address only statistical\nheterogeneity while overlooking the domain-fracture problem, where each\nclient's data distribution differs markedly from that faced at testing time,\nundermining model generalizability. When clients use different architectures,\nhave non-identically distributed data, and encounter distinct test domains,\ncurrent methods perform poorly. To address these challenges, we propose\nUnifiedFL, a dynamic federated learning framework that represents heterogeneous\nlocal networks as nodes and edges in a directed model graph optimized by a\nshared graph neural network (GNN).

We begin by systematically\nreviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR,\nand Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their\ncapabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their\npotential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception\nframeworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that\nmoves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based,\nand cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a\ncross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze\ncutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to\nhybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven\napproaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language\nModels (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey\ndelivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future\nopportunities.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\uff08AVs\uff09\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u672f\u5982\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u548c\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u524d\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6574\u5408\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86AV\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u3001\u8d85\u58f0\u6ce2\u3001LiDAR\u548c\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u878d\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u7c7b\u6574\u7406\u4e86AV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6280\u672f\u3002", "result": "\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAV\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u672a\u6765\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86LLM/VLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3aAV\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u65b0\u5174AI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Yet, their accurate\nand efficient forecast remains a persistent challenge for numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) systems due to limitations in physical representation,\ninitialization, and the immense computational demands of ensemble forecasts.\nWhile data-driven forecasting is rapidly evolving, its application to the\ncomplex, three-dimensional dynamics of SSWs, particularly for probabilistic\nforecast, remains underexplored. Here, we bridge this gap by developing a Flow\nMatching-based generative AI model (FM-Cast) for efficient and skillful\nprobabilistic forecasting of the spatiotemporal evolution of stratospheric\ncirculation. Evaluated across 18 major SSW events (1998-2024), FM-Cast\nskillfully forecasts the onset, intensity, and morphology of 10 events up to 20\ndays in advance, achieving ensemble accuracies above 50%. Its performance is\ncomparable to or exceeds leading NWP systems while requiring only two minutes\nfor a 50-member, 30-day forecast on a consumer GPU. Furthermore, leveraging\nFM-Cast as a scientific tool, we demonstrate through idealized experiments that\nSSW predictability is fundamentally linked to its underlying physical drivers,\ndistinguishing between events forced from the troposphere and those driven by\ninternal stratospheric dynamics.

Among these methods, deep neural networks have been widely\nadopted due to their performance and accessibility, but they require large,\nhigh-quality datasets. Experimental data are often sparse, noisy, or\ninsufficient to build resilient data-driven models. Transfer learning, which\nleverages relevant data-abundant source domains to assist learning in\ndata-scarce target domains, has shown efficacy. Parameter transfer, where\npretrained weights are reused, is common but degrades under large domain\nshifts. Domain-adversarial neural networks (DANNs) help address this issue by\nlearning domain-invariant representations, thereby improving transfer under\ngreater domain shifts in a semi-supervised setting. However, DANNs can be\nunstable during training and lack a native means for uncertainty\nquantification. This study introduces a fully-supervised three-stage framework,\nthe staged Bayesian domain-adversarial neural network (staged B-DANN), that\ncombines parameter transfer and shared latent space adaptation. In Stage 1, a\ndeterministic feature extractor is trained on the source domain. This feature\nextractor is then adversarially refined using a DANN in Stage 2. In Stage 3, a\nBayesian neural network is built on the adapted feature extractor for\nfine-tuning on the target domain to handle conditional shifts and yield\ncalibrated uncertainty estimates. This staged B-DANN approach was first\nvalidated on a synthetic benchmark, where it was shown to significantly\noutperform standard transfer techniques. It was then applied to the task of\npredicting critical heat flux in rectangular channels, leveraging data from\ntube experiments as the source domain. The results of this study show that the\nstaged B-DANN method can improve predictive accuracy and generalization,\npotentially assisting other domains in nuclear engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08staged B-DANN\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5927\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u5608\u6742\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u8fc1\u79fb\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5927\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u57df\u5bf9\u6297\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff08DANN\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u6539\u5584\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u6e90\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff1b2\uff09\u7528DANN\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6761\u4ef6\u504f\u79fb\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u8fc1\u79fb\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u77e9\u5f62\u901a\u9053\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e90\u57df\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "staged B-DANN\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u6838\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

However, the impact of shortcuts on feature\nrepresentations remains understudied, obstructing the design of principled\nshortcut-mitigation methods. To overcome this limitation, we investigate the\nlayer-wise localization of shortcuts in deep models. Our novel experiment\ndesign quantifies the layer-wise contribution to accuracy degradation caused by\na shortcut-inducing skew by counterfactual training on clean and skewed\ndatasets. We employ our design to study shortcuts on CIFAR-10, Waterbirds, and\nCelebA datasets across VGG, ResNet, DeiT, and ConvNeXt architectures.

The key idea is\nto model a conditional distribution as a smooth probability trajectory defined\nby a weighted sum of Gaussian components whose parameters -- the mean and\ncovariance -- are functions of the input variable constructed using Bernstein\npolynomials. The loss function is the averaged squared Wasserstein distance\nbetween the predicted Gaussian distributions and the empirical data, which\ntakes into account the geometry of the distributions. An autodiff-based\noptimization method is used to train the model. Experiments on synthetic\ndatasets that include complex trajectories demonstrated that the proposed\nmethod provides competitive approximation quality in terms of the Wasserstein\ndistance, Energy Distance, and RMSE metrics, especially in cases of pronounced\nnonlinearity. The model demonstrates trajectory smoothness that is better than\nor comparable to alternatives and robustness to changes in data structure,\nwhile maintaining high interpretability due to explicit parameterization via\ncontrol points.

Accurate world models are essential for\nenabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic\nsettings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and\ndegrade over long horizons.

This approach yields significantly improved latent\nrepresentations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.\nGRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales\nwith trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative\nbackbones.

Such models rely\non key assumptions about the underlying process in order to enable faithful\nlearning of governing dynamics that mimic the actual system behavior. The de\nfacto assumption in current approaches relies on the principle of least action\nthat results in gradient field dynamics and leads to trajectories minimizing an\nenergy functional between two probability measures. However, many real-world\nsystems, such as cell cycles in single-cell RNA, are known to exhibit\nnon-gradient, periodic behavior, which fundamentally cannot be captured by\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods such as flow and bridge matching. In this\npaper, we introduce Curly Flow Matching (Curly-FM), a novel approach that is\ncapable of learning non-gradient field dynamics by designing and solving a\nSchr\\\"odinger bridge problem with a non-zero drift reference process -- in\nstark contrast to typical zero-drift reference processes -- which is\nconstructed using inferred velocities in addition to population snapshot data.\nWe showcase Curly-FM by solving the trajectory inference problems for single\ncells, computational fluid dynamics, and ocean currents with approximate\nvelocities. We demonstrate that Curly-FM can learn trajectories that better\nmatch both the reference process and population marginals.
