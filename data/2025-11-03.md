### [1] [Do Vision-Language Models Measure Up? Benchmarking Visual Measurement Reading with MeasureBench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26865)
*Fenfen Lin,Yesheng Liu,Haiyu Xu,Chen Yue,Zheqi He,Mingxuan Zhao,Miguel Hu Chen,Jiakang Liu,JG Yao,Xi Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MeasureBench是一个视觉测量阅读基准测试，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在测量仪器读数上的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类可以轻松读取测量仪器，但当前视觉语言模型在此任务上表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: 提出了MeasureBench基准测试和可扩展的数据合成流程，生成多样化的测量图像。

Result: 前沿视觉语言模型在测量读数上表现不佳，尤其是在指针定位上存在明显问题。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了当前模型在细粒度空间定位上的局限性，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Reading measurement instruments is effortless for humans and requires
relatively little domain expertise, yet it remains surprisingly challenging for
current vision-language models (VLMs) as we find in preliminary evaluation. In
this work, we introduce MeasureBench, a benchmark on visual measurement reading
covering both real-world and synthesized images of various types of
measurements, along with an extensible pipeline for data synthesis. Our
pipeline procedurally generates a specified type of gauge with controllable
visual appearance, enabling scalable variation in key details such as pointers,
scales, fonts, lighting, and clutter. Evaluation on popular proprietary and
open-weight VLMs shows that even the strongest frontier VLMs struggle
measurement reading in general. A consistent failure mode is indicator
localization: models can read digits or labels but misidentify the key
positions of pointers or alignments, leading to big numeric errors despite
plausible textual reasoning. We have also conducted preliminary experiments
with reinforcement learning over synthetic data, and find encouraging results
on in-domain synthetic subset but less promising for real-world images. Our
analysis highlights a fundamental limitation of current VLMs in fine-grained
spatial grounding. We hope this resource can help future advances on visually
grounded numeracy and precise spatial perception of VLMs, bridging the gap
between recognizing numbers and measuring the world.

### [2] [PF-DAformer: Proximal Femur Segmentation via Domain Adaptive Transformer for Dual-Center QCT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26903)
*Rochak Dhakal,Chen Zhao,Zixin Shi,Joyce H. Keyak,Tadashi S. Kaneko,Kuan-Jui Su,Hui Shen,Hong-Wen Deng,Weihua Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对多机构QCT的域自适应变换器分割框架，通过对抗对齐和统计对齐解决域偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不同机构间扫描仪、重建设置和患者人口统计学差异导致的域偏移问题，确保骨质疏松症研究和定量指标的跨站点可重复性。

Method: 结合3D TransUNet骨干网络，采用梯度反转层（GRL）进行对抗对齐和最大均值差异（MMD）进行统计对齐。

Result: 模型在包含1,024和384张QCT图像的两个数据集上训练和验证，实现了跨扫描仪的稳健分割。

Conclusion: 提出的双机制框架在保持解剖细节的同时，实现了跨机构的分割一致性，为多中心研究提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) plays a crucial role in assessing bone
strength and fracture risk by enabling volumetric analysis of bone density
distribution in the proximal femur. However, deploying automated segmentation
models in practice remains difficult because deep networks trained on one
dataset often fail when applied to another. This failure stems from domain
shift, where scanners, reconstruction settings, and patient demographics vary
across institutions, leading to unstable predictions and unreliable
quantitative metrics. Overcoming this barrier is essential for multi-center
osteoporosis research and for ensuring that radiomics and structural finite
element analysis results remain reproducible across sites. In this work, we
developed a domain-adaptive transformer segmentation framework tailored for
multi-institutional QCT. Our model is trained and validated on one of the
largest hip fracture related research cohorts to date, comprising 1,024 QCT
images scans from Tulane University and 384 scans from Rochester, Minnesota for
proximal femur segmentation. To address domain shift, we integrate two
complementary strategies within a 3D TransUNet backbone: adversarial alignment
via Gradient Reversal Layer (GRL), which discourages the network from encoding
site-specific cues, and statistical alignment via Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), which explicitly reduces distributional mismatches between institutions.
This dual mechanism balances invariance and fine-grained alignment, enabling
scanner-agnostic feature learning while preserving anatomical detail.

### [3] [DC4GS: Directional Consistency-Driven Adaptive Density Control for 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26921)
*Moonsoo Jeong,Dongbeen Kim,Minseong Kim,Sungkil Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC4GS通过引入方向一致性（DC）优化自适应密度控制（ADC），减少冗余分割并提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ADC仅基于位置梯度幅度进行分割，忽略了梯度的方向一致性，导致冗余分割和重建质量不足。

Method: 利用梯度的角度一致性实现DC，优化分割决策和位置选择，使子基元更好地对齐局部结构。

Result: 实验显示DC4GS减少基元数量达30%，并显著提升重建保真度。

Conclusion: DC4GS通过方向一致性改进ADC，在减少计算量的同时提升3D高斯泼溅的重建效果。

Abstract: We present a Directional Consistency (DC)-driven Adaptive Density Control
(ADC) for 3D Gaussian Splatting (DC4GS). Whereas the conventional ADC bases its
primitive splitting on the magnitudes of positional gradients, we further
incorporate the DC of the gradients into ADC, and realize it through the
angular coherence of the gradients. Our DC better captures local structural
complexities in ADC, avoiding redundant splitting. When splitting is required,
we again utilize the DC to define optimal split positions so that
sub-primitives best align with the local structures than the conventional
random placement. As a consequence, our DC4GS greatly reduces the number of
primitives (up to 30% in our experiments) than the existing ADC, and also
enhances reconstruction fidelity greatly.

*Yi Luo,Yike Guo,Hamed Hooshangnejad,Kai Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态调整课程设计的训练策略SACL，用于解决数据稀缺场景下的肺结节检测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在临床数据稀缺场景下表现不佳，传统静态课程学习策略难以适应。

Method: SACL通过自适应epoch调度、硬样本注入和规模感知优化三种机制动态调整课程设计。

Result: 在LUNA25数据集上，SACL在数据受限条件下显著优于基线，提升4.6%、3.5%和2.0%。

Conclusion: SACL为医疗场景下数据稀缺的肺结节检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Lung nodule detection in chest CT is crucial for early lung cancer diagnosis,
yet existing deep learning approaches face challenges when deployed in clinical
settings with limited annotated data. While curriculum learning has shown
promise in improving model training, traditional static curriculum strategies
fail in data-scarce scenarios. We propose Scale Adaptive Curriculum Learning
(SACL), a novel training strategy that dynamically adjusts curriculum design
based on available data scale. SACL introduces three key mechanisms:(1)
adaptive epoch scheduling, (2) hard sample injection, and (3) scale-aware
optimization. We evaluate SACL on the LUNA25 dataset using YOLOv11 as the base
detector. Experimental results demonstrate that while SACL achieves comparable
performance to static curriculum learning on the full dataset in mAP50, it
shows significant advantages under data-limited conditions with 4.6%, 3.5%, and
2.0% improvements over baseline at 10%, 20%, and 50% of training data
respectively. By enabling robust training across varying data scales without
architectural modifications, SACL provides a practical solution for healthcare
institutions to develop effective lung nodule detection systems despite limited
annotation resources.

### [5] [SYNAPSE-Net: A Unified Framework with Lesion-Aware Hierarchical Gating for Robust Segmentation of Heterogeneous Brain Lesions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26961)
*Md. Mehedi Hassan,Shafqat Alam,Shahriar Ahmed Seam,Maruf Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SYNAPSE-Net提出了一种统一的多模态MRI脑病变分割框架，结合多流CNN、Swin Transformer和动态跨模态注意力融合，实现了高性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有深度学习模型在脑病变分割中泛化性差、性能波动大的问题。

Method: 采用多流CNN编码器、Swin Transformer瓶颈、动态跨模态注意力融合机制和分层门控解码器，结合数据增强和难度感知采样训练。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上达到SOTA性能：WMH（DSC 0.831）、ISLES 2022（HD95 9.69）、BraTS 2020（DSC 0.8651）。

Conclusion: SYNAPSE-Net为多模态脑病变分割提供了鲁棒且临床可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Automated segmentation of heterogeneous brain lesions from multi-modal MRI
remains a critical challenge in clinical neuroimaging. Current deep learning
models are typically specialized `point solutions' that lack generalization and
high performance variance, limiting their clinical reliability. To address
these gaps, we propose the Unified Multi-Stream SYNAPSE-Net, an adaptive
framework designed for both generalization and robustness. The framework is
built on a novel hybrid architecture integrating multi-stream CNN encoders, a
Swin Transformer bottleneck for global context, a dynamic cross-modal attention
fusion (CMAF) mechanism, and a hierarchical gated decoder for high-fidelity
mask reconstruction. The architecture is trained with a variance reduction
strategy that combines pathology specific data augmentation and
difficulty-aware sampling method. The model was evaluated on three different
challenging public datasets: the MICCAI 2017 WMH Challenge, the ISLES 2022
Challenge, and the BraTS 2020 Challenge. Our framework attained a
state-of-the-art DSC value of 0.831 with the HD95 value of 3.03 in the WMH
dataset. For ISLES 2022, it achieved the best boundary accuracy with a
statistically significant difference (HD95 value of 9.69). For BraTS 2020, it
reached the highest DSC value for the tumor core region (0.8651). These
experimental findings suggest that our unified adaptive framework achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple brain pathologies, providing a
robust and clinically feasible solution for automated segmentation. The source
code and the pre-trained models are available at

### [6] [Semantic Frame Aggregation-based Transformer for Live Video Comment Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26978)
*Anam Fatima,Yi Yu,Janak Kapuriya,Julien Lalanne,Jainendra Shukla*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语义帧聚合的Transformer模型（SFAT），用于实时视频评论生成，并通过新构建的大规模英语数据集验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频评论生成中，现有方法忽略了视频帧的语义相关性，导致评论缺乏上下文准确性。

Method: SFAT模型利用CLIP的多模态知识，加权聚合语义相关帧，并通过交叉注意力机制生成评论。

Result: 构建了包含438小时视频和320万评论的英语数据集，SFAT在生成上下文相关评论上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SFAT通过语义帧加权和跨模态注意力，显著提升了实时视频评论的上下文准确性。

Abstract: Live commenting on video streams has surged in popularity on platforms like
Twitch, enhancing viewer engagement through dynamic interactions. However,
automatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a
challenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data
and extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important
aspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer
interactions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually
appropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame
Aggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.
This method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to
generate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their
semantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient
weighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing
less on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention
mechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment
reflects contextual cues from both chats and video. Furthermore, to address the
limitations of existing datasets, which predominantly focus on Chinese-language
content with limited video categories, we have constructed a large scale,
diverse, multimodal English video comments dataset. Extracted from Twitch, this
dataset covers 11 video categories, totaling 438 hours and 3.2 million
comments. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our SFAT model by comparing it to
existing methods for generating comments from live video and ongoing dialogue
contexts.

Result: 在3410个CT扫描的10个数据集上表现出色，展示了竞争性的精度。

Conclusion: MoME为医学图像分析提供了一种新颖且有效的架构，结合了视觉和语言信息。

Abstract: In this study, we propose MoME, a Mixture of Visual Language Medical Experts,
for Medical Image Segmentation. MoME adapts the successful Mixture of Experts
(MoE) paradigm, widely used in Large Language Models (LLMs), for medical
vision-language tasks. The architecture enables dynamic expert selection by
effectively utilizing multi-scale visual features tailored to the intricacies
of medical imagery, enriched with textual embeddings. This work explores a
novel integration of vision-language models for this domain. Utilizing an
assembly of 10 datasets, encompassing 3,410 CT scans, MoME demonstrates strong
performance on a comprehensive medical imaging segmentation benchmark. Our
approach explores the integration of foundation models for medical imaging,
benefiting from the established efficacy of MoE in boosting model performance
by incorporating textual information. Demonstrating competitive precision
across multiple datasets, MoME explores a novel architecture for achieving
robust results in medical image analysis.

### [8] [Incremental Human-Object Interaction Detection with Invariant Relation Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27020)
*Yana Wei,Zeen Chi,Chongyu Wang,Yu Wu,Shipeng Yan,Yongfei Liu,Xuming He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的无示例增量关系蒸馏（IRD）框架，用于解决动态环境中人类-物体交互（HOI）检测的增量学习问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在开放世界中，HOI不断变化，传统封闭世界模型难以应对。受人类渐进学习能力启发，探索增量HOI检测（IHOID）。

Method: IRD框架解耦对象和关系学习，引入两种独特的蒸馏损失，学习跨不同HOI组合的不变关系特征。

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO数据集上，方法在减少遗忘、增强对交互漂移的鲁棒性及零样本HOI泛化方面优于基线。

Conclusion: IRD框架有效解决了增量HOI检测中的关键挑战，展示了优越性能。

Abstract: In open-world environments, human-object interactions (HOIs) evolve
continuously, challenging conventional closed-world HOI detection models.
Inspired by humans' ability to progressively acquire knowledge, we explore
incremental HOI detection (IHOID) to develop agents capable of discerning
human-object relations in such dynamic environments. This setup confronts not
only the common issue of catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning but
also distinct challenges posed by interaction drift and detecting zero-shot HOI
combinations with sequentially arriving data. Therefore, we propose a novel
exemplar-free incremental relation distillation (IRD) framework. IRD decouples
the learning of objects and relations, and introduces two unique distillation
losses for learning invariant relation features across different HOI
combinations that share the same relation. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET
and V-COCO datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method over
state-of-the-art baselines in mitigating forgetting, strengthening robustness
against interaction drift, and generalization on zero-shot HOIs. Code is

### [10] [AD-SAM: Fine-Tuning the Segment Anything Vision Foundation Model for Autonomous Driving Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27047)
*Mario Camarena,Het Patel,Fatemeh Nazari,Evangelos Papalexakis,Mohamadhossein Noruzoliaee,Jia Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AD-SAM是一种针对自动驾驶场景优化的语义分割模型，通过双编码器和可变形解码器提升性能，在多个基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶场景中复杂空间和几何结构的语义分割问题，提升分割精度和泛化能力。

Method: 采用双编码器（ViT-H和ResNet-50）提取多尺度特征，通过可变形融合模块对齐特征，并使用混合损失函数优化训练。

Result: 在Cityscapes和BDD100K上分别达到68.1和59.5 mIoU，显著优于基准模型，且具有更高的数据效率和泛化能力。

Conclusion: AD-SAM通过针对性的架构和优化改进，为自动驾驶感知提供了可靠且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents the Autonomous Driving Segment Anything Model (AD-SAM), a
fine-tuned vision foundation model for semantic segmentation in autonomous
driving (AD). AD-SAM extends the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with a
dual-encoder and deformable decoder tailored to spatial and geometric
complexity of road scenes. The dual-encoder produces multi-scale fused
representations by combining global semantic context from SAM's pretrained
Vision Transformer (ViT-H) with local spatial detail from a trainable
convolutional deep learning backbone (i.e., ResNet-50). A deformable fusion
module aligns heterogeneous features across scales and object geometries. The
decoder performs progressive multi-stage refinement using deformable attention.
Training is guided by a hybrid loss that integrates Focal, Dice,
Lovasz-Softmax, and Surface losses, improving semantic class balance, boundary
precision, and optimization stability. Experiments on the Cityscapes and
Berkeley DeepDrive 100K (BDD100K) benchmarks show that AD-SAM surpasses SAM,
Generalized SAM (G-SAM), and a deep learning baseline (DeepLabV3) in
segmentation accuracy. It achieves 68.1 mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on
Cityscapes and 59.5 mIoU on BDD100K, outperforming SAM, G-SAM, and DeepLabV3 by
margins of up to +22.9 and +19.2 mIoU in structured and diverse road scenes,
respectively. AD-SAM demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization with a
0.87 retention score (vs. 0.76 for SAM), and faster, more stable learning
dynamics, converging within 30-40 epochs, enjoying double the learning speed of
benchmark models. It maintains 0.607 mIoU with only 1000 samples, suggesting
data efficiency critical for reducing annotation costs. These results confirm
that targeted architectural and optimization enhancements to foundation models
enable reliable and scalable AD perception.

### [11] [Hierarchical Transformers for Unsupervised 3D Shape Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27088)
*Aditya Vora,Lily Goli,Andrea Tagliasacchi,Hao Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiT是一种新颖的分层神经场表示方法，用于3D形状的无监督学习，通过分层变压器自动识别跨类别的共同子结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常限制在固定的层次结构（如二叉树），无法灵活适应多样化的形状类别和复杂层次。

Method: 使用分层变压器（HiT）和压缩代码本，学习树层次结构中的父子关系，无需固定层次限制。

Result: 在55个ShapeNet类别的无监督形状分割任务中，成功实现多粒度分割。

Conclusion: HiT能够自动推断数据中的层次结构，适用于复杂和多样化的形状类别，优于现有方法。

Abstract: We introduce HiT, a novel hierarchical neural field representation for 3D
shapes that learns general hierarchies in a coarse-to-fine manner across
different shape categories in an unsupervised setting. Our key contribution is
a hierarchical transformer (HiT), where each level learns parent-child
relationships of the tree hierarchy using a compressed codebook. This codebook
enables the network to automatically identify common substructures across
potentially diverse shape categories. Unlike previous works that constrain the
task to a fixed hierarchical structure (e.g., binary), we impose no such
restriction, except for limiting the total number of nodes at each tree level.
This flexibility allows our method to infer the hierarchical structure directly
from data, over multiple shape categories, and representing more general and
complex hierarchies than prior approaches. When trained at scale with a
reconstruction loss, our model captures meaningful containment relationships
between parent and child nodes. We demonstrate its effectiveness through an
unsupervised shape segmentation task over all 55 ShapeNet categories, where our
method successfully segments shapes into multiple levels of granularity.

*Haonan Wang,Jingyu Lu,Hongrui Li,Xiaomeng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ZEBRA是一种零样本脑视觉解码框架，无需特定主题适应即可实现通用神经解码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法依赖特定主题模型或微调，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。

Method: 通过对抗训练分解fMRI表示，分离主题相关和语义相关成分。

Result: ZEBRA在零样本基准上表现优异，性能接近全微调模型。

Conclusion: ZEBRA为通用神经解码提供了可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural decoding have enabled the reconstruction of visual
experiences from brain activity, positioning fMRI-to-image reconstruction as a
promising bridge between neuroscience and computer vision. However, current
methods predominantly rely on subject-specific models or require
subject-specific fine-tuning, limiting their scalability and real-world
applicability. In this work, we introduce ZEBRA, the first zero-shot brain
visual decoding framework that eliminates the need for subject-specific
adaptation. ZEBRA is built on the key insight that fMRI representations can be
decomposed into subject-related and semantic-related components. By leveraging
adversarial training, our method explicitly disentangles these components to
isolate subject-invariant, semantic-specific representations. This
disentanglement allows ZEBRA to generalize to unseen subjects without any
additional fMRI data or retraining. Extensive experiments show that ZEBRA
significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines and achieves performance
comparable to fully finetuned models on several metrics. Our work represents a
scalable and practical step toward universal neural decoding. Code and model
weights are available at: https://github.com/xmed-lab/ZEBRA.

### [13] [WildfireX-SLAM: A Large-scale Low-altitude RGB-D Dataset for Wildfire SLAM and Beyond](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27133)
*Zhicong Sun,Jacqueline Lo,Jinxing Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个用于森林场景的大规模合成数据集WildfireX-SLAM，以支持3D高斯溅射（3DGS）在SLAM中的应用，特别是在野火应急响应和森林管理中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3DGS-based SLAM研究主要集中于小规模室内场景，缺乏适用于大规模森林场景的高质量数据集，而真实场景数据采集成本高且技术难度大。

Method: 利用Unreal Engine 5的Electric Dreams环境样本项目，开发了一个数据采集管道，可灵活控制环境因素（如光照、天气、野火类型和条件），并收集了5.5k张低空RGB-D航拍图像。

Result: 数据集WildfireX-SLAM覆盖16 km²的森林地图，并进行了基准测试，揭示了森林场景中3DGS-based SLAM的独特挑战和改进方向。

Conclusion: 该数据集和代码将公开，为未来研究提供了重要资源，并推动了3DGS-based SLAM在森林场景中的应用。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) and its subsequent variants have led to
remarkable progress in simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While most
recent 3DGS-based SLAM works focus on small-scale indoor scenes, developing
3DGS-based SLAM methods for large-scale forest scenes holds great potential for
many real-world applications, especially for wildfire emergency response and
forest management. However, this line of research is impeded by the absence of
a comprehensive and high-quality dataset, and collecting such a dataset over
real-world scenes is costly and technically infeasible. To this end, we have
built a large-scale, comprehensive, and high-quality synthetic dataset for SLAM
in wildfire and forest environments. Leveraging the Unreal Engine 5 Electric
Dreams Environment Sample Project, we developed a pipeline to easily collect
aerial and ground views, including ground-truth camera poses and a range of
additional data modalities from unmanned aerial vehicle. Our pipeline also
provides flexible controls on environmental factors such as light, weather, and
types and conditions of wildfire, supporting the need for various tasks
covering forest mapping, wildfire emergency response, and beyond. The resulting
pilot dataset, WildfireX-SLAM, contains 5.5k low-altitude RGB-D aerial images
from a large-scale forest map with a total size of 16 km2. On top of
WildfireX-SLAM, a thorough benchmark is also conducted, which not only reveals
the unique challenges of 3DGS-based SLAM in the forest but also highlights
potential improvements for future works. The dataset and code will be publicly
available. Project page: https://zhicongsun.github.io/wildfirexslam.

*Tong Shen,Jingai Yu,Dong Zhou,Dong Li,Emad Barsoum*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: E-MMDiT是一种高效轻量级的多模态扩散模型，仅需304M参数和少量训练资源即可快速生成高质量图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型需要大规模训练数据和高计算资源的问题，提供一种更高效的替代方案。

Method: 采用视觉标记压缩、多路径压缩模块、位置强化、交替子区域注意力（ASA）和AdaLN-affine等技术。

Result: 在512px图像生成任务中，仅用25M公开数据和1.5天训练，达到GenEval 0.66分，通过GRPO后提升至0.72。

Conclusion: E-MMDiT为未来研究提供了实用基线，有助于生成式AI模型的普及。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown strong capabilities in generating high-quality
images from text prompts. However, these models often require large-scale
training data and significant computational resources to train, or suffer from
heavy structure with high latency. To this end, we propose Efficient Multimodal
Diffusion Transformer (E-MMDiT), an efficient and lightweight multimodal
diffusion model with only 304M parameters for fast image synthesis requiring
low training resources. We provide an easily reproducible baseline with
competitive results. Our model for 512px generation, trained with only 25M
public data in 1.5 days on a single node of 8 AMD MI300X GPUs, achieves 0.66 on
GenEval and easily reaches to 0.72 with some post-training techniques such as
GRPO. Our design philosophy centers on token reduction as the computational
cost scales significantly with the token count. We adopt a highly compressive
visual tokenizer to produce a more compact representation and propose a novel
multi-path compression module for further compression of tokens. To enhance our
design, we introduce Position Reinforcement, which strengthens positional
information to maintain spatial coherence, and Alternating Subregion Attention
(ASA), which performs attention within subregions to further reduce
computational cost. In addition, we propose AdaLN-affine, an efficient
lightweight module for computing modulation parameters in transformer blocks.
Our code is available at https://github.com/AMD-AGI/Nitro-E and we hope E-MMDiT
serves as a strong and practical baseline for future research and contributes

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨视角信息传递和空间关系特征图优化方面存在不足，导致模型关注无关边缘噪声，影响定位性能。

Method: 通过CVCAM实现多轮跨视角交互学习上下文信息，结合MHSAM提取多尺度空间特征，并构建新数据集G2D。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了跨视角信息传递和噪声抑制问题，为跨视角物体地理定位提供了新思路。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization has recently gained attention due to
potential applications. Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of
query objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain
spatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object
locations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer
information between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship
feature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge
noise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these
limitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),
which performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,
enabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the
query object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of
cross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the
query object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module
(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract
multi-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit
correspondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query
object. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object
geo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the "Ground-to-Drone"
localization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in
"Ground-to-Drone" localization task. Extensive experiments on the CVOGL and G2D
datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves high localization
accuracy, surpassing the current state-of-the-art.

TL;DR: HiGS是一个分层生成框架，通过多步关联语义空间组合，实现可控和可扩展的3D场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多为单步生成，难以平衡场景复杂性与用户输入。受人类认知过程启发，提出分层生成框架。

Method: 提出HiGS框架和PHiSSG图结构，支持动态组织空间关系和语义依赖，确保一致性。

Result: 实验显示HiGS在布局合理性、风格一致性和用户偏好上优于单阶段方法。

Conclusion: HiGS为高效3D场景构建提供了可控且可扩展的范式。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene generation holds significant potential in gaming,
film, and virtual reality. However, most existing methods adopt a single-step
generation process, making it difficult to balance scene complexity with
minimal user input. Inspired by the human cognitive process in scene modeling,
which progresses from global to local, focuses on key elements, and completes
the scene through semantic association, we propose HiGS, a hierarchical
generative framework for multi-step associative semantic spatial composition.
HiGS enables users to iteratively expand scenes by selecting key semantic
objects, offering fine-grained control over regions of interest while the model
completes peripheral areas automatically. To support structured and coherent
generation, we introduce the Progressive Hierarchical Spatial-Semantic Graph
(PHiSSG), which dynamically organizes spatial relationships and semantic
dependencies across the evolving scene structure. PHiSSG ensures spatial and
geometric consistency throughout the generation process by maintaining a
one-to-one mapping between graph nodes and generated objects and supporting
recursive layout optimization. Experiments demonstrate that HiGS outperforms
single-stage methods in layout plausibility, style consistency, and user
preference, offering a controllable and extensible paradigm for efficient 3D
scene construction.

Motivation: 遥感图像场景分类因地面物体的复杂空间结构和多尺度特性而具有挑战性，现有方法在局部纹理和全局上下文建模上各有优势，但高效整合它们仍是一个瓶颈。

Method: AFM-Net通过CNN分支提取层次视觉先验，Mamba分支进行全局序列建模，并通过层次融合机制动态交互多尺度特征，最后通过Mixture-of-Experts分类器进行细粒度场景识别。

Result: 在AID、NWPU-RESISC45和UC Merced数据集上，AFM-Net分别达到93.72%、95.54%和96.92%的准确率，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: AFM-Net通过层次融合机制和动态特征交互，实现了高性能和高效率的遥感图像场景分类。

Abstract: Remote sensing image scene classification remains a challenging task,
primarily due to the complex spatial structures and multi-scale characteristics
of ground objects. Existing approaches see CNNs excel at modeling local
textures, while Transformers excel at capturing global context. However,
efficiently integrating them remains a bottleneck due to the high computational
cost of Transformers. To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced
Hierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global
co-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting
hierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence
modeling. The core innovation of AFM-Net lies in its Hierarchical Fusion
Mechanism, which progressively aggregates multi-scale features from both
pathways, enabling dynamic cross-level feature interaction and contextual
reconstruction to produce highly discriminative representations. These fused
features are then adaptively routed through a Mixture-of-Experts classifier
module, which dispatches them to the most suitable experts for fine-grained
scene recognition. Experiments on AID, NWPU-RESISC45, and UC Merced show that
AFM-Net obtains 93.72, 95.54, and 96.92 percent accuracy, surpassing
state-of-the-art methods with balanced performance and efficiency. Code is

Motivation: Banff分类是评估肾移植活检的全球标准，但其半定量性质、复杂标准和观察者间变异性给计算复制带来挑战。

Method: 将Banff指标分解为结构和炎症成分，评估现有分割和检测工具是否支持其计算，并通过启发式规则映射到Banff评分。

Result: 研究展示了部分成功和关键失败模式，如结构遗漏、幻觉和检测模糊性，中间表示的不一致性常影响可解释性。

Conclusion: 当前AI流程在复制专家级计算评分方面存在局限，强调模块化评估和计算Banff评分标准对未来模型开发的重要性。

Abstract: The Banff Classification provides the global standard for evaluating renal
transplant biopsies, yet its semi-quantitative nature, complex criteria, and
inter-observer variability present significant challenges for computational
replication. In this study, we explore the feasibility of approximating Banff
lesion scores using existing deep learning models through a modular, rule-based
framework. We decompose each Banff indicator - such as glomerulitis (g),
peritubular capillaritis (ptc), and intimal arteritis (v) - into its
constituent structural and inflammatory components, and assess whether current
segmentation and detection tools can support their computation. Model outputs
are mapped to Banff scores using heuristic rules aligned with expert
guidelines, and evaluated against expert-annotated ground truths. Our findings
highlight both partial successes and critical failure modes, including
structural omission, hallucination, and detection ambiguity. Even when final
scores match expert annotations, inconsistencies in intermediate
representations often undermine interpretability. These results reveal the
limitations of current AI pipelines in replicating computational expert-level
grading, and emphasize the importance of modular evaluation and computational
Banff grading standard in guiding future model development for transplant
pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合视觉语言模型、大语言模型和物体检测系统的新流程，以提升高分辨率图像的描述质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时因低分辨率预训练导致的细节丢失和重要物体遗漏问题。

Method: 通过多阶段流程生成初始描述，识别关键物体，预测并验证相关物体，最后补充未提及物体的区域描述。

Result: 实验表明，该流程能生成更详细、可靠的图像描述，并有效减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了高分辨率图像描述的准确性和细节丰富度。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and
detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically
pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels).
Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss
of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models,
large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption
quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage
process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated
using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The
LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key
objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly
detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused,
region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process
enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to
undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison
and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark
for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of
high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and
reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.

Motivation: 现有相机-雷达融合方法多为单帧输入，场景信息不完整，且图像退化和雷达稀疏性影响检测性能。多帧融合能提供更丰富的时空信息，但面临跨模态特征融合和计算成本的挑战。

Method: 提出M^3Detection框架，利用基线检测器的中间特征和跟踪器生成的参考轨迹，设计全局和局部特征聚合模块，并通过时空推理模块增强跨帧交互。

Result: 在VoD和TJ4DRadSet数据集上，M^3Detection实现了最先进的3D检测性能。

Conclusion: M^3Detection在多帧相机-4D雷达融合检测中表现出色，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D imaging radar have enabled robust perception in adverse
weather, while camera sensors provide dense semantic information. Fusing the
these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D
perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to
single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete
scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity,
hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers
richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust
and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and
mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.
Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object
detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal
data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate
features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce
reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer
information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level
inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align
global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature
aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories
to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then
processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to
encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection
achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its
effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.

Motivation: 现有方法难以联合预测下一状态观察和动作序列，因模态差异导致性能受限。

Method: 提出双流扩散架构，独立噪声扰动和解耦流匹配损失，避免统一潜在空间需求。

Result: 在模拟基准测试中提升6%，真实任务中成功率提高13%，预训练带来显著迁移增益。

Conclusion: DUST有效解决模态冲突，提升VLA性能，支持大规模预训练。

Abstract: Recently, augmenting Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with world modeling
has shown promise in improving robotic policy learning. However, it remains
challenging to jointly predict next-state observations and action sequences
because of the inherent difference between the two modalities. To address this,
we propose DUal-STream diffusion (DUST), a world-model augmented VLA framework
that handles the modality conflict and enhances the performance of VLAs across
diverse tasks. Specifically, we propose a multimodal diffusion transformer
architecture that explicitly maintains separate modality streams while still
enabling cross-modal knowledge sharing. In addition, we introduce independent
noise perturbations for each modality and a decoupled flow-matching loss. This
design enables the model to learn the joint distribution in a bidirectional
manner while avoiding the need for a unified latent space. Based on the
decoupling of modalities during training, we also introduce a joint sampling
method that supports test-time scaling, where action and vision tokens evolve
asynchronously at different rates. Through experiments on simulated benchmarks
such as RoboCasa and GR-1, DUST achieves up to 6% gains over baseline methods,
while our test-time scaling approach provides an additional 2-5% boost. On
real-world tasks with the Franka Research 3, DUST improves success rates by
13%, confirming its effectiveness beyond simulation. Furthermore, pre-training
on action-free videos from BridgeV2 yields significant transfer gains on
RoboCasa, underscoring DUST's potential for large-scale VLA pretraining.

Result: 实验表明模型性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DANCER框架在舞蹈视频生成任务中表现优异，数据与代码将公开。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion models have shown their impressive ability in visual
generation tasks. Besides static images, more and more research attentions have
been drawn to the generation of realistic videos. The video generation not only
has a higher requirement for the quality, but also brings a challenge in
ensuring the video continuity. Among all the video generation tasks,
human-involved contents, such as human dancing, are even more difficult to
generate due to the high degrees of freedom associated with human motions. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework, named as DANCER (Dance ANimation via
Condition Enhancement and Rendering with Diffusion Model), for realistic
single-person dance synthesis based on the most recent stable video diffusion
model. As the video generation is generally guided by a reference image and a
video sequence, we introduce two important modules into our framework to fully
benefit from the two inputs. More specifically, we design an Appearance
Enhancement Module (AEM) to focus more on the details of the reference image
during the generation, and extend the motion guidance through a Pose Rendering
Module (PRM) to capture pose conditions from extra domains. To further improve
the generation capability of our model, we also collect a large amount of video
data from Internet, and generate a novel datasetTikTok-3K to enhance the model
training. The effectiveness of the proposed model has been evaluated through
extensive experiments on real-world datasets, where the performance of our
model is superior to that of the state-of-the-art methods. All the data and
codes will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成中表现出色，但迭代去噪过程的高计算成本阻碍了实际部署。现有缓存技术存在速度与质量之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出H2-Cache，基于去噪过程可分为结构定义和细节细化阶段的洞察，采用双阈值系统和轻量级相似性估计技术（PFS）。

Result: 在Flux架构上的实验表明，H2-Cache实现了高达5.08倍的加速，同时图像质量与基线几乎相同。

Conclusion: H2-Cache有效解决了速度与质量的权衡问题，为高保真扩散模型的实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as state-of-the-art in image generation, but
their practical deployment is hindered by the significant computational cost of
their iterative denoising process. While existing caching techniques can
accelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed
and fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational
overhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel
hierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model
architectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising
process can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a
detail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold
system, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure
the efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature
summarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity
estimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that
H2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining
image quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a
robust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality
dilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of
high-fidelity diffusion models. Source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频识别攻击可能泄露用户的观看历史，涉及隐私敏感信息，如爱好、信仰等，现有技术依赖网络流量分析，存在局限性。

Method: 利用字幕内容的轮廓及其时间差异，结合时空特征，提出SilhouetteTell方法，通过字幕轮廓与字幕文件的时空相关性推断视频内容。

Result: 实验表明，SilhouetteTell在多种环境下（如40米距离）能高效推断视频标题和片段。

Conclusion: SilhouetteTell展示了通过字幕轮廓进行视频识别的可行性，对隐私保护提出新挑战。

Abstract: Video identification attacks pose a significant privacy threat that can
reveal videos that victims watch, which may disclose their hobbies, religious
beliefs, political leanings, sexual orientation, and health status. Also, video
watching history can be used for user profiling or advertising and may result
in cyberbullying, discrimination, or blackmail. Existing extensive video
inference techniques usually depend on analyzing network traffic generated by
streaming online videos. In this work, we observe that the content of a
subtitle determines its silhouette displayed on the screen, and identifying
each subtitle silhouette also derives the temporal difference between two
consecutive subtitles. We then propose SilhouetteTell, a novel video
identification attack that combines the spatial and time domain information
into a spatiotemporal feature of subtitle silhouettes. SilhouetteTell explores
the spatiotemporal correlation between recorded subtitle silhouettes of a video
and its subtitle file. It can infer both online and offline videos.
Comprehensive experiments on off-the-shelf smartphones confirm the high
efficacy of SilhouetteTell for inferring video titles and clips under various
settings, including from a distance of up to 40 meters.

Motivation: 由于视角差异和硬负样本的存在，现有方法容易受到分布偏移的影响，导致梯度噪声和收敛不稳定。

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DPHR策略有效提升了跨视角地理定位的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) between drone and satellite imagery
remains challenging due to severe viewpoint gaps and the presence of hard
negatives, which are visually similar but geographically mismatched samples.
Existing mining or reweighting strategies often use static weighting, which is
sensitive to distribution shifts and prone to overemphasizing difficult samples
too early, leading to noisy gradients and unstable convergence. In this paper,
we present a Dual-level Progressive Hardness-aware Reweighting (DPHR) strategy.
At the sample level, a Ratio-based Difficulty-Aware (RDA) module evaluates
relative difficulty and assigns fine-grained weights to negatives. At the batch
level, a Progressive Adaptive Loss Weighting (PALW) mechanism exploits a
training-progress signal to attenuate noisy gradients during early optimization
and progressively enhance hard-negative mining as training matures. Experiments
on the University-1652 and SUES-200 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness
and robustness of the proposed DPHR, achieving consistent improvements over
state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验证明该方法能显著加速反演（最高3.79倍），同时保持或提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 稀疏反演策略有效解决了高分辨率图像反演的低效问题，适用于数据无关的模型量化和知识迁移。

Abstract: Model inversion, which aims to reconstruct the original training data from
pre-trained discriminative models, is especially useful when the original
training data is unavailable due to privacy, usage rights, or size constraints.
However, existing dense inversion methods attempt to reconstruct the entire
image area, making them extremely inefficient when inverting high-resolution
images from large-scale Vision Transformers (ViTs). We further identify two
underlying causes of this inefficiency: the redundant inversion of noisy
backgrounds and the unintended inversion of spurious correlations--a phenomenon
we term "hallucination" in model inversion. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel sparse model inversion strategy, as a plug-and-play extension
to speed up existing dense inversion methods with no need for modifying their
original loss functions. Specifically, we selectively invert semantic
foregrounds while stopping the inversion of noisy backgrounds and potential
spurious correlations. Through both theoretical and empirical studies, we
validate the efficacy of our approach in achieving significant inversion
acceleration (up to 3.79 faster) while maintaining comparable or even enhanced
downstream performance in data-free model quantization and data-free knowledge
transfer. Code is available at https://github.com/Egg-Hu/SMI.

Method: 提出MIVA任务，构建包含同步视频、文本和真实标签的多模态数据集，并评估GPT-4o等先进模型的表现。

Result: 现有MLLMs（如GPT-4o）在识别谎言时表现不佳，未能有效结合视觉社交线索，且可能过于保守。

Conclusion: 需开发新方法以提升AI系统的感知能力和可信度。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly integrated into human lives, endowing them
with robust social intelligence has emerged as a critical frontier. A key
aspect of this intelligence is discerning truth from deception, a ubiquitous
element of human interaction that is conveyed through a complex interplay of
verbal language and non-verbal visual cues. However, automatic deception
detection in dynamic, multi-party conversations remains a significant
challenge. The recent rise of powerful Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), with their impressive abilities in visual and textual understanding,
makes them natural candidates for this task. Consequently, their capabilities
in this crucial domain are mostly unquantified. To address this gap, we
introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Veracity Assessment (MIVA), and
present a novel multimodal dataset derived from the social deduction game
Werewolf. This dataset provides synchronized video, text, with verifiable
ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark
evaluating state-of-the-art MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap:
even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood
reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to
ground language in visual social cues effectively and may be overly
conservative in their alignment, highlighting the urgent need for novel
approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为探索村庄空间模式和生成逻辑提供了科学依据。

Abstract: Villages areas hold significant importance in the study of human-land
relationships. However, with the advancement of urbanization, the gradual
disappearance of spatial characteristics and the homogenization of landscapes
have emerged as prominent issues. Existing studies primarily adopt a
single-disciplinary perspective to analyze villages spatial morphology and its
influencing factors, relying heavily on qualitative analysis methods. These
efforts are often constrained by the lack of digital infrastructure and
insufficient data. To address the current research limitations, this paper
proposes a Hierarchical Graph Neural Network (HGNN) model that integrates
multi-source data to conduct an in-depth analysis of villages spatial
morphology. The framework includes two types of nodes-input nodes and
communication nodes-and two types of edges-static input edges and dynamic
communication edges. By combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph
Attention Networks (GAT), the proposed model efficiently integrates multimodal
features under a two-stage feature update mechanism. Additionally, based on
existing principles for classifying villages spatial morphology, the paper
introduces a relational pooling mechanism and implements a joint training
strategy across 17 subtypes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method
achieves significant performance improvements over existing approaches in
multimodal fusion and classification tasks. Additionally, the proposed joint
optimization of all sub-types lifts mean accuracy/F1 from 0.71/0.83
(independent models) to 0.82/0.90, driven by a 6% gain for parcel tasks. Our
method provides scientific evidence for exploring villages spatial patterns and

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的持续自监督学习框架，用于从多窗口胸部CT图像中学习多样化特征并确保数据隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像诊断中因数据稀缺和领域偏移导致的模型泛化能力不足问题，同时避免因隐私限制而无法重用历史数据。

Method: 结合潜在重放机制和特征蒸馏技术（Wasserstein距离知识蒸馏和批量知识集成），在持续预训练中减少领域偏移带来的灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在两种不同窗口设置的胸部CT图像上验证了方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效学习鲁棒且泛化的特征，同时保护数据隐私。

Abstract: We propose a novel continual self-supervised learning (CSSL) framework for
simultaneously learning diverse features from multi-window-obtained chest
computed tomography (CT) images and ensuring data privacy. Achieving a robust
and highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,
mainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately
annotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare
environments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from
differences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical
purposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past
data, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints. Our
approach addresses these challenges by effectively capturing the relationship
between previously learned knowledge and new information across different
training stages through continual pretraining on unlabeled images.
Specifically, by incorporating a latent replay-based mechanism into CSSL, our
method mitigates catastrophic forgetting due to domain shifts during continual
pretraining while ensuring data privacy. Additionally, we introduce a feature
distillation technique that integrates Wasserstein distance-based knowledge
distillation (WKD) and batch-knowledge ensemble (BKE), enhancing the ability of
the model to learn meaningful, domain-shift-robust representations. Finally, we
validate our approach using chest CT images obtained across two different
window settings, demonstrating superior performance compared with other
approaches.

TL;DR: SpecAware是一种新型高光谱基础模型，通过融合传感器元属性和图像内容，实现多传感器统一学习，提升HSI映射性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高光谱数据异质性和多传感器训练中的泛化性问题，现有方法忽视传感器元属性的指导作用。

Method: 设计了两步超网络驱动编码过程：元内容感知模块生成条件输入，HyperEmbedding模块动态生成矩阵因子进行通道编码。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，适用于土地覆盖语义分割、变化检测和场景分类。

Conclusion: SpecAware能自适应处理不同传感器数据，建立统一预训练框架，显著提升特征表示能力。

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a vital tool for fine-grained land-use and
land-cover (LULC) mapping. However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has
long posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.
Although HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream
tasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of
sensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their
transferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a
novel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying
multi-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K
dataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality
benchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS
sensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding
process for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to
generate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each
spectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own
image content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a
sample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors
for channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction
and latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to
perceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and
sensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable
number of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint
pre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware
can learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic
segmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.

Abstract: Accurate building instance segmentation and height classification are
critical for urban planning, 3D city modeling, and infrastructure monitoring.
This paper presents a detailed analysis of YOLOv11, the recent advancement in
the YOLO series of deep learning models, focusing on its application to joint
building extraction and discrete height classification from satellite imagery.
YOLOv11 builds on the strengths of earlier YOLO models by introducing a more
efficient architecture that better combines features at different scales,
improves object localization accuracy, and enhances performance in complex
urban scenes. Using the DFC2023 Track 2 dataset -- which includes over 125,000
annotated buildings across 12 cities -- we evaluate YOLOv11's performance using
metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and mean average precision (mAP).
Our findings demonstrate that YOLOv11 achieves strong instance segmentation
performance with 60.4\% mAP@50 and 38.3\% mAP@50--95 while maintaining robust
classification accuracy across five predefined height tiers. The model excels
in handling occlusions, complex building shapes, and class imbalance,
particularly for rare high-rise structures. Comparative analysis confirms that
YOLOv11 outperforms earlier multitask frameworks in both detection accuracy and
inference speed, making it well-suited for real-time, large-scale urban
mapping. This research highlights YOLOv11's potential to advance semantic urban
reconstruction through streamlined categorical height modeling, offering
actionable insights for future developments in remote sensing and geospatial
intelligence.

Conclusion: MoRE通过动态专家路由和优化设计，显著提升了3D视觉任务的性能和适应性。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and vision have demonstrated that scaling up
model capacity consistently improves performance across diverse tasks. In 3D
visual geometry reconstruction, large-scale training has likewise proven
effective for learning versatile representations. However, further scaling of
3D models is challenging due to the complexity of geometric supervision and the
diversity of 3D data. To overcome these limitations, we propose MoRE, a dense
3D visual foundation model based on a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
that dynamically routes features to task-specific experts, allowing them to
specialize in complementary data aspects and enhance both scalability and
adaptability. Aiming to improve robustness under real-world conditions, MoRE
incorporates a confidence-based depth refinement module that stabilizes and
refines geometric estimation. In addition, it integrates dense semantic
features with globally aligned 3D backbone representations for high-fidelity
surface normal prediction. MoRE is further optimized with tailored loss
functions to ensure robust learning across diverse inputs and multiple
geometric tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MoRE achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks and supports effective
downstream applications without extra computation.

Result: 在RetargetMe基准测试中表现最佳，处理速度快（0.009s/1024x683）。

Conclusion: Object-IR高效且无需标注数据，适用于实时处理。

Abstract: Eliminating geometric distortion in semantically important regions remains an
intractable challenge in image retargeting. This paper presents Object-IR, a
self-supervised architecture that reformulates image retargeting as a
learning-based mesh warping optimization problem, where the mesh deformation is
guided by object appearance consistency and geometric-preserving constraints.
Given an input image and a target aspect ratio, we initialize a uniform rigid
mesh at the output resolution and use a convolutional neural network to predict
the motion of each mesh grid and obtain the deformed mesh. The retargeted
result is generated by warping the input image according to the rigid mesh in
the input image and the deformed mesh in the output resolution. To mitigate
geometric distortion, we design a comprehensive objective function
incorporating a) object-consistent loss to ensure that the important semantic
objects retain their appearance, b) geometric-preserving loss to constrain
simple scale transform of the important meshes, and c) boundary loss to enforce
a clean rectangular output. Notably, our self-supervised paradigm eliminates
the need for manually annotated retargeting datasets by deriving supervision
directly from the input's geometric and semantic properties. Extensive
evaluations on the RetargetMe benchmark demonstrate that our Object-IR achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods in quantitative
metrics and subjective visual quality assessments. The framework efficiently
processes arbitrary input resolutions (average inference time: 0.009s for
1024x683 resolution) while maintaining real-time performance on consumer-grade
GPUs. The source code will soon be available at

Conclusion: FuseCPath有效融合异构病理模型，提升下游任务表现。

Abstract: Whole slide image (WSI) analysis has emerged as an increasingly essential
technique in computational pathology. Recent advances in the pathological
foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated significant advantages in deriving
meaningful patch-level or slide-level feature representations from WSIs.
However, current pathological FMs have exhibited substantial heterogeneity
caused by diverse private training datasets and different network
architectures. This heterogeneity introduces performance variability when we
utilize the extracted features from different FMs in the downstream tasks. To
fully explore the advantage of multiple FMs effectively, in this work, we
propose a novel framework for the fusion of heterogeneous pathological FMs,
called FuseCPath, yielding a model with a superior ensemble performance. The
main contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To
guarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a
multi-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via
multiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
patch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online
capture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous
slide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the
connections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung
cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR-10和Fashion-MNIST数据集上显著提升了分类准确率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过频率和空间域结合，有效提升了对抗攻击的防御能力。

Abstract: In recent times, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been successfully adopted
for various applications. Despite their notable achievements, it has become
evident that DNNs are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial attacks,
restricting their applications in security-critical systems. In this paper, we
present two-phase training methods to tackle the attack: first, training the
denoising network, and second, the deep classifier model. We propose a novel
denoising strategy that integrates both spatial and frequency domain approaches
to defend against adversarial attacks on images. Our analysis reveals that
high-frequency components of attacked images are more severely corrupted
compared to their lower-frequency counterparts. To address this, we leverage
Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for frequency analysis and develop a denoising
network that combines spatial image features with wavelets through a
transformer layer. Next, we retrain the classifier using the denoised images,
which enhances the classifier's robustness against adversarial attacks.
Experimental results across the MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Fashion-MNIST datasets
reveal that the proposed method remarkably elevates classification accuracy,
substantially exceeding the performance by utilizing a denoising network and
adversarial training approaches. The code is available at

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in computer
vision tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection.
However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect
predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is
crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel
approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a
previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function
to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both
clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters
alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust
representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental
results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various
types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps
extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of
adversarial robustness in deep learning.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
zero-shot action recognition by learning to associate video embeddings with
class embeddings. However, a significant challenge arises when relying solely
on action classes to provide semantic context, particularly due to the presence
of multi-semantic words, which can introduce ambiguity in understanding the
intended concepts of actions. To address this issue, we propose an innovative
approach that harnesses web-crawled descriptions, leveraging a large-language
model to extract relevant keywords. This method reduces the need for human
annotators and eliminates the laborious manual process of attribute data
creation. Additionally, we introduce a spatio-temporal interaction module
designed to focus on objects and action units, facilitating alignment between
description attributes and video content. In our zero-shot experiments, our
model achieves impressive results, attaining accuracies of 81.0%, 53.1%, and
68.9% on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and Kinetics-600, respectively, underscoring the

Conclusion: RegionRAG通过区域级检索和动态管道设计，显著提升了多模态RAG的性能和效率。

Abstract: Multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a critical method
for empowering LLMs by leveraging candidate visual documents. However, current
methods consider the entire document as the basic retrieval unit, introducing
substantial irrelevant visual content in two ways: 1) Relevant documents often
contain large regions unrelated to the query, diluting the focus on salient
information; 2) Retrieving multiple documents to increase recall further
introduces redundant and irrelevant documents. These redundant contexts
distract the model's attention and further degrade the performance. To address
this challenge, we propose \modelname, a novel framework that shifts the
retrieval paradigm from the document level to the region level. During
training, we design a hybrid supervision strategy from both labeled data and
unlabeled data to pinpoint relevant patches. During inference, we propose a
dynamic pipeline that intelligently groups salient patches into complete
semantic regions. By delegating the task of identifying relevant regions to the
retriever, \modelname enables the generator to focus solely on concise visual
content relevant to queries, improving both efficiency and accuracy.
Experiments on six benchmarks demonstrate that RegionRAG achieves
state-of-the-art performance. Improves retrieval accuracy by 10.02\% in R@1 on

Conclusion: T^3为临床环境中的自适应模型融合提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In medical imaging, vision-language models face a critical duality:
pretrained networks offer broad robustness but lack subtle, modality-specific
characteristics, while fine-tuned expert models achieve high in-distribution
accuracy yet falter under modality shift. Existing model-merging techniques,
designed for natural-image benchmarks, are simple and efficient but fail to
deliver consistent gains across diverse medical modalities; their static
interpolation limits reliability in varied clinical tasks. To address this, we
introduce Test-Time Task adaptive merging (T^3), a backpropagation-free
framework that computes per-sample interpolation coefficients via the
Jensen-Shannon divergence between the two models' output distributions. T^3
dynamically preserves local precision when models agree and defers to
generalist robustness under drift. To overcome the inference costs of
sample-wise merging, we further propose a batch-wise extension, T^3_B, that
computes a merging coefficient across a batch of samples, dramatically reducing
computational bottleneck. Recognizing the lack of a standardized
medical-merging benchmark, we present a rigorous cross-evaluation protocol
spanning in-domain, base-to-novel, and corruptions across four modalities.
Empirically, T^3 sets new state-of-the-art in Top-1 accuracy and error
reduction, outperforming strong baselines while maintaining efficiency, paving
the way for adaptive MVLM deployment in clinical settings. Our code is

Motivation: 当前GUI代理模型缺乏对自身能力边界的自我认知，导致过度自信和不可靠预测，这在动态GUI任务中尤为关键。

Result: 在七个挑战基准测试中，HyperClick实现了最先进的性能，并提供良好校准的自信度。

Conclusion: HyperClick通过显式自信度校准和自省式自我批评，减少了过度自信，支持更可靠的GUI自动化。

Abstract: Autonomous Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents rely on accurate GUI
grounding, which maps language instructions to on-screen coordinates, to
execute user commands. However, current models, whether trained via supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT), lack self-awareness of
their capability boundaries, leading to overconfidence and unreliable
predictions. We first systematically evaluate probabilistic and verbalized
confidence in general and GUI-specific models, revealing a misalignment between
confidence and actual accuracy, which is particularly critical in dynamic GUI
automation tasks, where single errors can cause task failure. To address this,
we propose HyperClick, a novel framework that enhances reliable GUI grounding
through uncertainty calibration. HyperClick introduces a dual reward mechanism,
combining a binary reward for correct actions with a truncated Gaussian-based
spatial confidence modeling, calibrated using the Brier score. This approach
jointly optimizes grounding accuracy and confidence reliability, fostering
introspective self-criticism. Extensive experiments on seven challenge
benchmarks show that HyperClick achieves state-of-the-art performance while
providing well-calibrated confidence. By enabling explicit confidence
calibration and introspective self-criticism, HyperClick reduces overconfidence
and supports more reliable GUI automation.

Result: 在长视频问答基准测试中，FOCUS处理少于2%的帧数，准确性显著提升，20分钟以上视频准确率提高11.9%。

Conclusion: FOCUS为长视频理解提供了一种简单通用的解决方案，展示了其在关键帧选择中的高效性。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) represent images and video frames as
visual tokens. Scaling from single images to hour-long videos, however,
inflates the token budget far beyond practical limits. Popular pipelines
therefore either uniformly subsample or apply keyframe selection with
retrieval-style scoring using smaller vision-language models. However, these
keyframe selection methods still rely on pre-filtering before selection to
reduce the inference cost and can miss the most informative moments.
  We propose FOCUS, Frame-Optimistic Confidence Upper-bound Selection, a
training-free, model-agnostic keyframe selection module that selects
query-relevant frames under a strict token budget. FOCUS formulates keyframe
selection as a combinatorial pure-exploration (CPE) problem in multi-armed
bandits: it treats short temporal clips as arms, and uses empirical means and
Bernstein confidence radius to identify informative regions while preserving
exploration of uncertain areas. The resulting two-stage
exploration-exploitation procedure reduces from a sequential policy with
theoretical guarantees, first identifying high-value temporal regions, then
selecting top-scoring frames within each region On two long-video
question-answering benchmarks, FOCUS delivers substantial accuracy improvements
while processing less than 2% of video frames. For videos longer than 20
minutes, it achieves an 11.9% gain in accuracy on LongVideoBench, demonstrating
its effectiveness as a keyframe selection method and providing a simple and
general solution for scalable long-video understanding with MLLMs.

Result: 实验表明S-GRACE擦除性能提升26%，非目标概念保留更好，训练时间减少90%。

Conclusion: S-GRACE通过语义引导有效解决了现有方法的局限性，显著提升了概念擦除的效率和效果。

Abstract: Concept erasure aims to selectively unlearning undesirable content in
diffusion models (DMs) to reduce the risk of sensitive content generation. As a
novel paradigm in concept erasure, most existing methods employ adversarial
training to identify and suppress target concepts, thus reducing the likelihood
of sensitive outputs. However, these methods often neglect the specificity of
adversarial training in DMs, resulting in only partial mitigation. In this
work, we investigate and quantify this specificity from the perspective of
concept space, i.e., can adversarial samples truly fit the target concept
space? We observe that existing methods neglect the role of conceptual
semantics when generating adversarial samples, resulting in ineffective fitting
of concept spaces. This oversight leads to the following issues: 1) when there
are few adversarial samples, they fail to comprehensively cover the object
concept; 2) conversely, they will disrupt other target concept spaces.
Motivated by the analysis of these findings, we introduce S-GRACE
(Semantics-Guided Robust Adversarial Concept Erasure), which grace leveraging
semantic guidance within the concept space to generate adversarial samples and
perform erasure training. Experiments conducted with seven state-of-the-art
methods and three adversarial prompt generation strategies across various DM
unlearning scenarios demonstrate that S-GRACE significantly improves erasure
performance 26%, better preserves non-target concepts, and reduces training
time by 90%. Our code is available at https://github.com/Qhong-522/S-GRACE.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像超分辨率在提高诊断准确性的同时降低采集成本和扫描时间，但如何在低计算开销下建模长距离解剖结构和精细频率细节仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出GASM模块（门控注意力增强状态空间模块）和PFFM模块（金字塔频率融合模块），分别用于全局依赖建模和多分辨率高频细节捕捉。

Result: 在五种医学成像模态上表现优异，PSNR/SSIM优于现有CNN和Transformer方法，参数规模小于0.75M。

Conclusion: 频率感知状态空间模型在可扩展和精确的医学图像增强中具有有效性。

Abstract: Medical image super-resolution (SR) is essential for enhancing diagnostic
accuracy while reducing acquisition cost and scanning time. However, modeling
both long-range anatomical structures and fine-grained frequency details with
low computational overhead remains challenging. We propose FGMamba, a novel
frequency-aware gated state-space model that unifies global dependency modeling
and fine-detail enhancement into a lightweight architecture. Our method
introduces two key innovations: a Gated Attention-enhanced State-Space Module
(GASM) that integrates efficient state-space modeling with dual-branch spatial
and channel attention, and a Pyramid Frequency Fusion Module (PFFM) that
captures high-frequency details across multiple resolutions via FFT-guided
fusion. Extensive evaluations across five medical imaging modalities
(Ultrasound, OCT, MRI, CT, and Endoscopic) demonstrate that FGMamba achieves
superior PSNR/SSIM while maintaining a compact parameter footprint ($<$0.75M),
outperforming CNN-based and Transformer-based SOTAs. Our results validate the
effectiveness of frequency-aware state-space modeling for scalable and accurate
medical image enhancement.

TL;DR: CASR-Net是一种三阶段管道，用于冠状动脉分割和细化，通过多通道预处理和创新的分割网络，显著提高了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期检测冠状动脉疾病（CAD）对降低死亡率和改善治疗计划至关重要，但X射线图像质量差会影响诊断。

Method: CASR-Net包括图像预处理、分割和细化三个阶段，采用多通道预处理策略和基于UNet的分割网络。

Result: 在公共数据集上，CASR-Net的IoU为61.43%，DSC为76.10%，clDice为79.36%，优于其他先进模型。

Conclusion: CASR-Net为冠状动脉分割提供了一种稳健的自动化方法，有助于临床诊断和治疗计划。

Abstract: Early detection of coronary artery disease (CAD) is critical for reducing
mortality and improving patient treatment planning. While angiographic image
analysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying
cardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality
can significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery
Segmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline
comprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel
multichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham
method provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by
0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using
the techniques individually. The core innovation is a segmentation network
built on a UNet with a DenseNet121 encoder and a Self-organized Operational
Neural Network (Self-ONN) based decoder, which preserves the continuity of
narrow and stenotic vessel branches. A final contour refinement module further
suppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a
combination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic
arteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an
IoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%. These results highlight a
robust approach to automated coronary artery segmentation, offering a valuable
tool to support clinicians in diagnosis and treatment planning.

Motivation: 现有提示池方法假设增量任务中的类别集是独立的，忽略了检测图像中固有的共现现象，导致混淆。

Method: P$^2$IOD利用神经网络全局演化特性，将网络作为参数化提示，自适应地整合跨任务知识，并采用参数化提示融合策略约束更新。

Conclusion: P$^2$IOD通过自适应整合和约束更新，有效解决了增量目标检测中的共现问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into
pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the
application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains
underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class
sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook
the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring
scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task
images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that
prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across
tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated
by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection
(P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD
employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate
knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD
further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments
on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's
effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among
existing baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应的无锯齿高斯溅射框架SAGS，用于内窥镜视频中动态组织的重建，解决了现有方法在渲染速度和细节捕捉上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜视频中动态组织的重建在机器人辅助手术中至关重要，但现有方法因组织运动导致的锯齿和伪影问题影响重建质量。

Method: SAGS框架采用注意力驱动的动态加权4D变形解码器，结合3D平滑滤波器和2D Mip滤波器，减少伪影并捕捉组织运动细节。

Result: 在EndoNeRF和SCARED两个公开基准测试中，SAGS在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上均优于现有方法，且可视化质量更优。

Conclusion: SAGS通过自适应方法显著提升了动态组织重建的质量和效率，为机器人辅助手术提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Surgical reconstruction of dynamic tissues from endoscopic videos is a
crucial technology in robot-assisted surgery. The development of Neural
Radiance Fields (NeRFs) has greatly advanced deformable tissue reconstruction,
achieving high-quality results from video and image sequences. However,
reconstructing deformable endoscopic scenes remains challenging due to aliasing
and artifacts caused by tissue movement, which can significantly degrade
visualization quality. The introduction of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has
improved reconstruction efficiency by enabling a faster rendering pipeline.
Nevertheless, existing 3DGS methods often prioritize rendering speed while
neglecting these critical issues. To address these challenges, we propose SAGS,
a self-adaptive alias-free Gaussian splatting framework. We introduce an
attention-driven, dynamically weighted 4D deformation decoder, leveraging 3D
smoothing filters and 2D Mip filters to mitigate artifacts in deformable tissue
reconstruction and better capture the fine details of tissue movement.
Experimental results on two public benchmarks, EndoNeRF and SCARED, demonstrate
that our method achieves superior performance in all metrics of PSNR, SSIM, and
LPIPS compared to the state of the art while also delivering better
visualization quality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在极低带宽场景（如深空探索、战场情报）中，现有文本到图像生成模型仅能提供语义级近似，无法满足视觉通信需求的问题。

Method: 通过联合文本和编码潜在特征引导修正流模型，实现视觉场景的精确生成，同时以极低比特率传输语义文本和编码潜在特征。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在保持图像重建质量和视觉分析精度的同时，显著降低了带宽需求。

Conclusion: 该方法为超低比特率视觉通信提供了一种高效解决方案，适用于多种挑战性场景。

Abstract: We consider the problem of ultra-low bit rate visual communication for remote
vision analysis, human interactions and control in challenging scenarios with
very low communication bandwidth, such as deep space exploration, battlefield
intelligence, and robot navigation in complex environments. In this paper, we
ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual
scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding
methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance
of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new
approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only
achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far
insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis
and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to
seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint
text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise
generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent
are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image
reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while
using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法处理复杂指令需联合微调LLMs和DMs，计算成本高，CIELR旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 构建结构化语义表示，引入迭代更新机制细化视觉表示，实现复杂编辑。

Result: 在PSNR指标上超越SOTA方法9.955 dB，并在自建基准CIEBench上表现优异。

Conclusion: CIELR高效且灵活，适用于复杂图像编辑任务，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Existing image editing methods can handle simple editing instructions very
well. To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly
fine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which
involves very high computational complexity and training cost. To address this
issue, we propose a new method, called \textbf{C}omplex \textbf{I}mage
\textbf{E}diting via \textbf{L}LM \textbf{R}easoning (CIELR), which converts a
complex user instruction into a set of simple and explicit editing actions,
eliminating the need for jointly fine-tuning the large language models and
diffusion models. Specifically, we first construct a structured semantic
representation of the input image using foundation models. Then, we introduce
an iterative update mechanism that can progressively refine this
representation, obtaining a fine-grained visual representation of the image
scene. This allows us to perform complex and flexible image editing tasks.
Extensive experiments on the SmartEdit Reasoning Scenario Set show that our
method surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 9.955 dB in PSNR, indicating
its superior preservation of regions that should remain consistent. Due to the
limited number of samples of public datasets of complex image editing with
reasoning, we construct a benchmark named CIEBench, containing 86 image
samples, together with a metric specifically for reasoning-based image editing.
CIELR also outperforms previous methods on this benchmark. The code and dataset

Motivation: 现有方法主要针对自然图像，缺乏对其他视觉模态（如视频和视觉文档）的支持，RzenEmbed旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段专注于基础文本和多模态检索；第二阶段引入改进的InfoNCE损失，包括难度加权机制和减少假阴性影响的策略，并结合可学习温度参数和模型融合。

Result: 在MMEB基准测试中达到新SOTA，尤其在视频和视觉文档检索任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: RzenEmbed通过统一框架和优化策略，显著提升了多模态检索性能，填补了现有方法的不足。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
extended CLIP-based frameworks to produce powerful, universal embeddings for
retrieval tasks. However, existing methods primarily focus on natural images,
offering limited support for other crucial visual modalities such as videos and
visual documents. To bridge this gap, we introduce RzenEmbed, a unified
framework to learn embeddings across a diverse set of modalities, including
text, images, videos, and visual documents. We employ a novel two-stage
training strategy to learn discriminative representations. The first stage
focuses on foundational text and multimodal retrieval. In the second stage, we
introduce an improved InfoNCE loss, incorporating two key enhancements.
Firstly, a hardness-weighted mechanism guides the model to prioritize
challenging samples by assigning them higher weights within each batch.
Secondly, we implement an approach to mitigate the impact of false negatives
and alleviate data noise. This strategy not only enhances the model's
discriminative power but also improves its instruction-following capabilities.
We further boost performance with learnable temperature parameter and model
souping. RzenEmbed sets a new state-of-the-art on the MMEB benchmark. It not
only achieves the best overall score but also outperforms all prior work on the
challenging video and visual document retrieval tasks. Our models are available

TL;DR: FPS是一种无需梯度的参数选择方法，通过单次前向传播确定最优参数子集，显著降低内存使用并加速选择过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法存在推理延迟、工程复杂或内存占用高的问题，需要更高效且实用的解决方案。

Method: FPS通过参数大小与输入激活的乘积排名参数，结合预训练知识和下游数据。

Result: 在24个视觉任务上，FPS性能媲美SOTA方法，内存占用减少9倍，选择速度提升2倍。

Conclusion: FPS为大规模预训练模型提供了一种内存高效且实用的微调方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has emerged as a key strategy for
adapting large-scale pre-trained models to downstream tasks, but existing
approaches face notable limitations. Addition-based methods, such as Adapters
[1], introduce inference latency and engineering complexity, while
selection-based methods like Gradient-based Parameter Selection (GPS) [2]
require a full backward pass, which results in the same peak memory usage as
full fine-tuning. To address this dilemma, we propose Feedforward-based
Parameter Selection (FPS), a gradient-free method that identifies an optimal
parameter subset in a single forward pass. FPS ranks parameters by the product
of their magnitudes and corresponding input activations, leveraging both
pre-trained knowledge and downstream data. Evaluated on $24$ visual tasks from
FGVC and VTAB-1k, FPS achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing peak memory usage by nearly $9 \times$ and accelerating
parameter selection by about $2 \times$, offering a genuinely memory-efficient
and practical solution for fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，适用于影视制作领域。

Abstract: We present a practical pipeline for fine-tuning open-source video diffusion
transformers to synthesize cinematic scenes for television and film production
from small datasets. The proposed two-stage process decouples visual style
learning from motion generation. In the first stage, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
modules are integrated into the cross-attention layers of the Wan2.1 I2V-14B
model to adapt its visual representations using a compact dataset of short
clips from Ay Yapim's historical television film El Turco. This enables
efficient domain transfer within hours on a single GPU. In the second stage,
the fine-tuned model produces stylistically consistent keyframes that preserve
costume, lighting, and color grading, which are then temporally expanded into
coherent 720p sequences through the model's video decoder. We further apply
lightweight parallelization and sequence partitioning strategies to accelerate
inference without quality degradation. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations
using FVD, CLIP-SIM, and LPIPS metrics, supported by a small expert user study,
demonstrate measurable improvements in cinematic fidelity and temporal
stability over the base model. The complete training and inference pipeline is
released to support reproducibility and adaptation across cinematic domains.

Result: 在多个图像数据集上的分类任务中，方法在少样本和跨域设置下均优于基线。

Conclusion: 证明了最优中间流形的存在性和唯一性，方法显著提升了模态对齐效果。

Abstract: Modality alignment is critical for vision-language models (VLMs) to
effectively integrate information across modalities. However, existing methods
extract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a
single feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address
this, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns
tree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.
Specifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework
that applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from
intermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual
features with coarse-to-fine semantics. We then embed the feature trees of the
two modalities into hyperbolic manifolds with distinct curvatures to
effectively model their hierarchical structures. To align across the
heterogeneous hyperbolic manifolds with different curvatures, we formulate a KL
distance measure between distributions on heterogeneous manifolds, and learn an
intermediate manifold for manifold alignment by minimizing the distance. We
prove the existence and uniqueness of the optimal intermediate manifold.
Experiments on taxonomic open-set classification tasks across multiple image
datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines
under few-shot and cross-domain settings.

<details>

Motivation: 生成对抗网络和扩散模型的快速发展使得合成媒体越来越逼真，引发了关于虚假信息、身份欺诈和数字信任的社会担忧。现有的深度伪造检测方法要么依赖深度学习（泛化能力差且易受失真影响），要么依赖法医分析（可解释但难以应对新技术）。

Method: 提出了一种混合框架，融合了法医特征（如噪声残差、JPEG压缩痕迹和频域描述符）与深度学习（CNN和ViT）的表征。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优异（F1分数分别为0.96、0.82和0.77），在压缩、对抗扰动和未知操作下表现稳健，且解释性分析显示与真实操作区域高度重叠（82%）。

Conclusion: 混合方法结合了深度模型的适应性和法医线索的可解释性，为开发弹性和可信的深度伪造检测系统提供了平衡解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion
models has made synthetic media increasingly realistic, raising societal
concerns around misinformation, identity fraud, and digital trust. Existing
deepfake detection methods either rely on deep learning, which suffers from
poor generalization and vulnerability to distortions, or forensic analysis,
which is interpretable but limited against new manipulation techniques. This
study proposes a hybrid framework that fuses forensic features, including noise
residuals, JPEG compression traces, and frequency-domain descriptors, with deep
learning representations from convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision
transformers (ViTs). Evaluated on benchmark datasets (FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF
v2, DFDC), the proposed model consistently outperformed single-method baselines
and demonstrated superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art
hybrid approaches, achieving F1-scores of 0.96, 0.82, and 0.77, respectively.
Robustness tests demonstrated stable performance under compression (F1 = 0.87
at QF = 50), adversarial perturbations (AUC = 0.84), and unseen manipulations
(F1 = 0.79). Importantly, explainability analysis showed that Grad-CAM and
forensic heatmaps overlapped with ground-truth manipulated regions in 82
percent of cases, enhancing transparency and user trust. These findings confirm
that hybrid approaches provide a balanced solution, combining the adaptability
of deep models with the interpretability of forensic cues, to develop resilient
and trustworthy deepfake detection systems.

Method: 通过审计MAMA-MIA数据集中的自动分割标签，评估了年龄、种族和数据来源对分割质量的影响。

Result: 研究发现存在对年轻患者的年龄相关偏见，且数据来源的聚合会影响种族偏见。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在模型开发中需关注数据细粒度分析，以避免偏见放大。

Abstract: Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness
evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image
segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the
quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical
decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we
audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast
cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation
quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an
intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist
even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We
hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known
challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how
aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic
biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.

Result: 在PRVR基准测试中显著提高了检索准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效防止了语义崩溃，提升了部分相关视频检索的性能。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) seeks videos where only part of the
content matches a text query. Existing methods treat every annotated text-video
pair as a positive and all others as negatives, ignoring the rich semantic
variation both within a single video and across different videos. Consequently,
embeddings of both queries and their corresponding video-clip segments for
distinct events within the same video collapse together, while embeddings of
semantically similar queries and segments from different videos are driven
apart. This limits retrieval performance when videos contain multiple, diverse
events. This paper addresses the aforementioned problems, termed as semantic
collapse, in both the text and video embedding spaces. We first introduce Text
Correlation Preservation Learning, which preserves the semantic relationships
encoded by the foundation model across text queries. To address collapse in
video embeddings, we propose Cross-Branch Video Alignment (CBVA), a contrastive
alignment method that disentangles hierarchical video representations across
temporal scales. Subsequently, we introduce order-preserving token merging and
adaptive CBVA to enhance alignment by producing video segments that are
internally coherent yet mutually distinctive. Extensive experiments on PRVR
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework effectively prevents semantic
collapse and substantially improves retrieval accuracy.

typically require extensive pre-training on large external datasets, limiting
their adaptability to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose DeblurSDI,
a zero-shot, self-supervised framework based on self-diffusion (SDI) that
requires no prior training. DeblurSDI formulates blind deconvolution as an
iterative reverse self-diffusion process that starts from pure noise and
progressively refines the solution. At each step, two randomly-initialized
neural networks are optimized continuously to refine the sharp image and the
blur kernel. The optimization is guided by an objective function combining data
consistency with a sparsity-promoting L1-norm for the kernel. A key innovation
is our noise scheduling mechanism, which stabilizes the optimization and
provides remarkable robustness to variations in blur kernel size. These allow
DeblurSDI to dynamically learn an instance-specific prior tailored to the input
image. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeblurSDI consistently achieves
superior performance, recovering sharp images and accurate kernels even in
highly degraded scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ViT在医学图像分析中计算需求高和小数据集过拟合的问题。

Method: 整合卷积分词器、对角掩码、动态温度缩放和池化序列聚合等技术。

Result: 在12个MedMNIST数据集上表现优异，参数仅4.5M，性能优于深层CNN和ViT变体。

Conclusion: CoMViT展示了在低资源医学图像分析中高效且可解释的ViT重新设计的潜力。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong potential in medical
imaging; however, their high computational demands and tendency to overfit on
small datasets limit their applicability in real-world clinical scenarios. In
this paper, we present CoMViT, a compact and generalizable Vision Transformer
architecture optimized for resource-constrained medical image analysis. CoMViT
integrates a convolutional tokenizer, diagonal masking, dynamic temperature
scaling, and pooling-based sequence aggregation to improve performance and
generalization. Through systematic architectural optimization, CoMViT achieves
robust performance across twelve MedMNIST datasets while maintaining a
lightweight design with only ~4.5M parameters. It matches or outperforms deeper
CNN and ViT variants, offering up to 5-20x parameter reduction without
sacrificing accuracy. Qualitative Grad-CAM analyses show that CoMViT
consistently attends to clinically relevant regions despite its compact size.
These results highlight the potential of principled ViT redesign for developing
efficient and interpretable models in low-resource medical imaging settings.

TL;DR: VisPainter是一个多代理框架，用于科学插图，提供元素级控制和后编辑能力，解决了现有生成模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前生成模型在科学插图中缺乏语义结构和编辑能力的问题，以及代码生成方法的不直观性。

Method: VisPainter通过Manager、Designer和Toolbox三个模块协作生成矢量图，支持元素级控制。

Result: 引入VisBench基准评估插图质量，验证了架构合理性和评估方法可靠性。

Conclusion: VisPainter在效率、直观性和迭代修改方面表现优异，为科学插图提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Scientific illustrations demand both high information density and
post-editability. However, current generative models have two major
limitations: Frist, image generation models output rasterized images lacking
semantic structure, making it impossible to access, edit, or rearrange
independent visual components in the images. Second, code-based generation
methods (TikZ or SVG), although providing element-level control, force users
into the cumbersome cycle of "writing-compiling-reviewing" and lack the
intuitiveness of manipulation. Neither of these two approaches can well meet
the needs for efficiency, intuitiveness, and iterative modification in
scientific creation. To bridge this gap, we introduce VisPainter, a multi-agent
framework for scientific illustration built upon the model context protocol.
VisPainter orchestrates three specialized modules-a Manager, a Designer, and a
Toolbox-to collaboratively produce diagrams compatible with standard vector
graphics software. This modular, role-based design allows each element to be
explicitly represented and manipulated, enabling true element-level control and
any element can be added and modified later. To systematically evaluate the
quality of scientific illustrations, we introduce VisBench, a benchmark with
seven-dimensional evaluation metrics. It assesses high-information-density
scientific illustrations from four aspects: content, layout, visual perception,
and interaction cost. To this end, we conducted extensive ablation experiments
to verify the rationality of our architecture and the reliability of our
evaluation methods. Finally, we evaluated various vision-language models,
presenting fair and credible model rankings along with detailed comparisons of
their respective capabilities. Additionally, we isolated and quantified the
impacts of role division, step control,and description on the quality of
illustrations.

Motivation: 发展中地区的教育设施数据稀缺且更新频率低，需要一种可扩展且经济高效的解决方案来支持规划和资源分配。

Method: 采用多层级方法：第一层通过机器学习分析人口密度、土地覆盖和现有基础设施；第二层使用中分辨率卫星图像（Sentinel-2）和高分辨率图像（VHR）结合深度学习模型定位学校候选位置；最终通过人机交互界面验证和优化结果。

Result: 初步评估表明，该策略为教育基础设施映射提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 多层级人机交互框架有效提高了教育设施记录的准确性和完整性，适用于发展中地区。

Abstract: This paper presents a multi-tiered human-in-the-loop framework for
interactive school mapping designed to improve the accuracy and completeness of
educational facility records, particularly in developing regions where such
data may be scarce and infrequently updated. The first tier involves a machine
learning based analysis of population density, land cover, and existing
infrastructure compared with known school locations. The first tier identifies
potential gaps and "mislabelled" schools. In subsequent tiers,
medium-resolution satellite imagery (Sentinel-2) is investigated to pinpoint
regions with a high likelihood of school presence, followed by the application
of very high-resolution (VHR) imagery and deep learning models to generate
detailed candidate locations for schools within these prioritised areas. The
medium-resolution approach was later removed due to insignificant improvements.
The medium and VHR resolution models build upon global pre-trained steps to
improve generalisation. A key component of the proposed approach is an
interactive interface to allow human operators to iteratively review, validate,
and refine the mapping results. Preliminary evaluations indicate that the
multi-tiered strategy provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for
educational infrastructure mapping to support planning and resource allocation.

Motivation: 由于高级生成模型生成的深度伪造内容迅速构成严重威胁，现有音视频深度伪造检测方法难以泛化到未见过的伪造内容。

Method: Referee通过从单样本中提取说话者特定线索，将参考和目标内容中的身份相关查询匹配和对齐到跨模态特征中，联合推理音视频同步性和身份一致性。

Result: 在FakeAVCeleb、FaceForensics++和KoDF数据集上的实验表明，Referee在跨数据集和跨语言评估中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 实验结果强调了跨模态身份验证对未来深度伪造检测的重要性。

Abstract: Since deepfakes generated by advanced generative models have rapidly posed
serious threats, existing audiovisual deepfake detection approaches struggle to
generalize to unseen forgeries. We propose a novel reference-aware audiovisual
deepfake detection method, called Referee. Speaker-specific cues from only
one-shot examples are leveraged to detect manipulations beyond spatiotemporal
artifacts. By matching and aligning identity-related queries from reference and
target content into cross-modal features, Referee jointly reasons about
audiovisual synchrony and identity consistency. Extensive experiments on
FakeAVCeleb, FaceForensics++, and KoDF demonstrate that Referee achieves
state-of-the-art performance on cross-dataset and cross-language evaluation
protocols. Experimental results highlight the importance of cross-modal
identity verification for future deepfake detection. The code is available at

Method: 构建了包含1.45M图像-文本对的NautData数据集，并提出了基于物理先验的VFE模块，集成到LLaVA-1.5和Qwen2.5-VL模型中。

Result: 实验表明VFE模块显著提升了基线模型的性能，NAUTILUS在水下场景理解任务中表现优越。

Conclusion: NAUTILUS通过数据集和VFE模块的引入，有效推动了水下场景理解领域的研究。

Abstract: Underwater exploration offers critical insights into our planet and attracts
increasing attention for its broader applications in resource exploration,
national security, etc. We study the underwater scene understanding methods,
which aim to achieve automated underwater exploration. The underwater scene
understanding task demands multi-task perceptions from multiple granularities.
However, the absence of large-scale underwater multi-task instruction-tuning
datasets hinders the progress of this research. To bridge this gap, we
construct NautData, a dataset containing 1.45 M image-text pairs supporting
eight underwater scene understanding tasks. It enables the development and
thorough evaluation of the underwater scene understanding models. Underwater
image degradation is a widely recognized challenge that interferes with
underwater tasks. To improve the robustness of underwater scene understanding,
we introduce physical priors derived from underwater imaging models and propose
a plug-and-play vision feature enhancement (VFE) module, which explicitly
restores clear underwater information. We integrate this module into renowned
baselines LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen2.5-VL and build our underwater LMM, NAUTILUS.
Experiments conducted on the NautData and public underwater datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the VFE module, consistently improving the
performance of both baselines on the majority of supported tasks, thus ensuring
the superiority of NAUTILUS in the underwater scene understanding area. Data

Result: 在视觉任务中平均提升34.7%，并展现出新兴的多模态智能能力。

Conclusion: 统一模型在多模态推理中展现出潜力，为新兴能力研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning requires iterative coordination between language and
vision, yet it remains unclear what constitutes a meaningful interleaved chain
of thought. We posit that text and image thoughts should function as
complementary, rather than isomorphic, modalities that mutually advance
reasoning. Guided by this principle, we build ThinkMorph, a unified model
fine-tuned on 24K high-quality interleaved reasoning traces spanning tasks with
varying visual engagement. ThinkMorph learns to generate progressive text-image
reasoning steps that concretely manipulate visual content while maintaining
coherent verbal logic. It delivers large gains on vision-centric benchmarks
(averaging 34.7% over the base model) and generalizes to out-of-domain tasks,
matching or surpassing larger and proprietary VLMs. Beyond performance,
ThinkMorph exhibits emergent multimodal intelligence, including unseen visual
manipulation skills, adaptive switching between reasoning modes, and better
test-time scaling through diversified multimodal thoughts.These findings
suggest promising directions for characterizing the emergent capabilities of
unified models for multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于深度学习的3D点云水印框架，用于版权保护和所有权验证，显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在数字媒体中快速增长，但传统水印技术难以应对几何和非几何攻击，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 通过SVD将二进制水印嵌入3D点云块的奇异值中，并利用PointNet++神经网络提取水印，训练网络以应对多种攻击。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上验证，深度学习提取方法在严重攻击下表现优异（比特准确率0.83，IoU 0.80）。

Conclusion: 该方法在严重失真下仍能实现高保真水印恢复，显著优于传统SVD技术。

Abstract: The protection of intellectual property has become critical due to the rapid
growth of three-dimensional content in digital media. Unlike traditional images
or videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,
as they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric
attacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In
this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural
watermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership
verification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of
3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning
using PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to
reliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such
as rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our
method using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep
learning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based
techniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation
demonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly
outperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise
accuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD
achieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,
which is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment. This
demonstrates our method's ability to achieve superior watermark recovery and
maintain high fidelity even under severe distortions.

TL;DR: MapSAM2是一个基于视觉基础模型的统一框架，用于自动分割历史地图图像和时间序列，通过少样本微调适应多样任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图分析因风格多样性和标注数据稀缺而困难，构建时空数据集耗时耗力，但这类数据对建筑年代、道路网络发展等应用至关重要。

Method: 将历史地图图像和时间序列视为视频处理，利用内存注意力机制整合上下文信息，并提出从单年地图生成伪时间序列以减少标注成本。

Result: 实验表明MapSAM2能有效学习时间关联，在有限监督或伪视频下准确分割并链接时间序列中的建筑物。

Conclusion: MapSAM2通过创新方法解决了历史地图分析的挑战，将发布数据集和代码支持未来研究。

Abstract: Historical maps are unique and valuable archives that document geographic
features across different time periods. However, automated analysis of
historical map images remains a significant challenge due to their wide
stylistic variability and the scarcity of annotated training data. Constructing
linked spatio-temporal datasets from historical map time series is even more
time-consuming and labor-intensive, as it requires synthesizing information
from multiple maps. Such datasets are essential for applications such as dating
buildings, analyzing the development of road networks and settlements, studying
environmental changes etc. We present MapSAM2, a unified framework for
automatically segmenting both historical map images and time series. Built on a
visual foundation model, MapSAM2 adapts to diverse segmentation tasks with
few-shot fine-tuning. Our key innovation is to treat both historical map images
and time series as videos. For images, we process a set of tiles as a video,
enabling the memory attention mechanism to incorporate contextual cues from
similar tiles, leading to improved geometric accuracy, particularly for areal
features. For time series, we introduce the annotated Siegfried Building Time
Series Dataset and, to reduce annotation costs, propose generating pseudo time
series from single-year maps by simulating common temporal transformations.
Experimental results show that MapSAM2 learns temporal associations effectively
and can accurately segment and link buildings in time series under limited
supervision or using pseudo videos. We will release both our dataset and code
to support future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个通用视频检索框架，通过联合设计评估、数据和模型，解决了现有方法在通用性上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频检索方法因局限于狭窄的基准测试和单任务训练，导致通用能力受限。

Method: 设计了通用视频检索基准（UVRB）、可扩展的数据合成工作流和模态金字塔训练方法。

Result: 提出的通用视频嵌入器（GVE）在UVRB上实现了零样本泛化的最佳性能。

Conclusion: 联合设计框架为迈向真正通用的视频检索提供了可行路径。

Abstract: The prevailing video retrieval paradigm is structurally misaligned, as narrow
benchmarks incentivize correspondingly limited data and single-task training.
Therefore, universal capability is suppressed due to the absence of a
diagnostic evaluation that defines and demands multi-dimensional
generalization. To break this cycle, we introduce a framework built on the
co-design of evaluation, data, and modeling. First, we establish the Universal
Video Retrieval Benchmark (UVRB), a suite of 16 datasets designed not only to
measure performance but also to diagnose critical capability gaps across tasks
and domains. Second, guided by UVRB's diagnostics, we introduce a scalable
synthesis workflow that generates 1.55 million high-quality pairs to populate
the semantic space required for universality. Finally, we devise the Modality
Pyramid, a curriculum that trains our General Video Embedder (GVE) by
explicitly leveraging the latent interconnections within our diverse data.
Extensive experiments show GVE achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
generalization on UVRB. In particular, our analysis reveals that popular
benchmarks are poor predictors of general ability and that partially relevant
retrieval is a dominant but overlooked scenario. Overall, our co-designed
framework provides a practical path to escape the limited scope and advance
toward truly universal video retrieval.

TL;DR: CroVCA是一种高效的大规模检索方法，通过简单的二进制交叉熵损失和编码率最大化正则化，实现跨视图一致的二进制编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模检索需要紧凑且具有区分性的表示，但高维嵌入空间中的最近邻搜索计算成本高，现有哈希方法复杂且训练时间长。

Method: 提出CroVCA原则，使用二进制交叉熵损失和编码率最大化正则化，设计轻量级HashCoder网络，支持冻结嵌入或LoRA微调。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，CroVCA仅需5个训练周期即达到最先进结果，训练时间极短（如COCO上2分钟）。

Conclusion: CroVCA高效、适应性强且广泛适用，为大规模检索提供了简单统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient large-scale retrieval requires representations that are both
compact and discriminative. Foundation models provide powerful visual and
multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional
spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by
enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing
approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs
specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We
introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle
for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned
views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate
maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and
diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP
hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced
codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt
encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves
state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly
well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes
and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These
results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.

Motivation: 神经网络容易受到对抗攻击，即微小扰动导致模型错误预测。研究旨在通过改进训练方法提升模型鲁棒性。

Method: 采用对抗训练的对比学习框架，结合硬正样本挖掘，使模型学习更稳定的表征。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，ANCHOR在干净和对抗样本（PGD-20）的准确率上均优于标准对抗训练方法。

Conclusion: 结合对抗训练和对比学习能帮助模型学习更结构化、鲁棒的表征，缩小准确率与鲁棒性之间的差距。

Abstract: Neural networks have changed the way machines interpret the world. At their
core, they learn by following gradients, adjusting their parameters step by
step until they identify the most discriminant patterns in the data. This
process gives them their strength, yet it also opens the door to a hidden flaw.
The very gradients that help a model learn can also be used to produce small,
imperceptible tweaks that cause the model to completely alter its decision.
Such tweaks are called adversarial attacks. These attacks exploit this
vulnerability by adding tiny, imperceptible changes to images that, while
leaving them identical to the human eye, cause the model to make wrong
predictions. In this work, we propose Adversarially-trained Contrastive
Hard-mining for Optimized Robustness (ANCHOR), a framework that leverages the
power of supervised contrastive learning with explicit hard positive mining to
enable the model to learn representations for images such that the embeddings
for the images, their augmentations, and their perturbed versions cluster
together in the embedding space along with those for other images of the same
class while being separated from images of other classes. This alignment helps
the model focus on stable, meaningful patterns rather than fragile gradient
cues. On CIFAR-10, our approach achieves impressive results for both clean and
robust accuracy under PGD-20 (epsilon = 0.031), outperforming standard
adversarial training methods. Our results indicate that combining adversarial
guidance with hard-mined contrastive supervision helps models learn more
structured and robust representations, narrowing the gap between accuracy and
robustness.

Result: 扩散特征编码生成器特定模式，提供简单可解释的合成图像取证基础。

Conclusion: FRIDA为合成图像取证提供轻量级解决方案，具有跨生成器泛化能力。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative diffusion models has enabled the creation of
synthetic images that are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real ones,
raising concerns about authenticity, copyright, and misinformation. Existing
supervised detectors often struggle to generalize across unseen generators,
requiring extensive labeled data and frequent retraining. We introduce FRIDA
(Fake-image Recognition and source Identification via Diffusion-features
Analysis), a lightweight framework that leverages internal activations from a
pre-trained diffusion model for deepfake detection and source generator
attribution. A k-nearest-neighbor classifier applied to diffusion features
achieves state-of-the-art cross-generator performance without fine-tuning,
while a compact neural model enables accurate source attribution. These results
show that diffusion representations inherently encode generator-specific
patterns, providing a simple and interpretable foundation for synthetic image
forensics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖昂贵监督或受限环境，限制了规模扩展。

Method: 提出五种自监督任务（如拼图重排、深度排序等），无需人工标注。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，平均准确率提升4.63%（3B）和3.89%（7B）。

Conclusion: 简单内在监督可实现规模化RLVR，增强LVLMs的空间智能。

Abstract: Spatial understanding remains a weakness of Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs). Existing supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and recent reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) pipelines depend on costly supervision,
specialized tools, or constrained environments that limit scale. We introduce
Spatial-SSRL, a self-supervised RL paradigm that derives verifiable signals
directly from ordinary RGB or RGB-D images. Spatial-SSRL automatically
formulates five pretext tasks that capture 2D and 3D spatial structure:
shuffled patch reordering, flipped patch recognition, cropped patch inpainting,
regional depth ordering, and relative 3D position prediction. These tasks
provide ground-truth answers that are easy to verify and require no human or
LVLM annotation. Training on our tasks substantially improves spatial reasoning
while preserving general visual capabilities. On seven spatial understanding
benchmarks in both image and video settings, Spatial-SSRL delivers average
accuracy gains of 4.63% (3B) and 3.89% (7B) over the Qwen2.5-VL baselines. Our
results show that simple, intrinsic supervision enables RLVR at scale and
provides a practical route to stronger spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Graphic layout generation is a growing research area focusing on generating
aesthetically pleasing layouts ranging from poster designs to documents. While
recent research has explored ways to incorporate user constraints to guide the
layout generation, these constraints often require complex specifications which
reduce usability. We introduce an innovative approach exploiting user-provided
sketches as intuitive constraints and we demonstrate empirically the
effectiveness of this new guidance method, establishing the sketch-to-layout
problem as a promising research direction, which is currently under-explored.
To tackle the sketch-to-layout problem, we propose a multimodal
transformer-based solution using the sketch and the content assets as inputs to
produce high quality layouts. Since collecting sketch training data from human
annotators to train our model is very costly, we introduce a novel and
efficient method to synthetically generate training sketches at scale. We train
and evaluate our model on three publicly available datasets: PubLayNet,
DocLayNet and SlidesVQA, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art
constraint-based methods, while offering a more intuitive design experience. In
order to facilitate future sketch-to-layout research, we release O(200k)
synthetically-generated sketches for the public datasets above. The datasets
are available at https://github.com/google-deepmind/sketch_to_layout.

Motivation: 解决医学图像分析中血管分割任务因标注数据稀缺和模型跨模态泛化能力差的问题。

Method: 提出VessShape方法，生成包含管状几何形状的合成数据集，以增强模型对形状的学习而非纹理。

Conclusion: 形状偏置预训练是克服数据稀缺和提升血管分割泛化能力的有效策略。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of blood vessels is an important task in medical image
analysis, but its progress is often hindered by the scarcity of large annotated
datasets and the poor generalization of models across different imaging
modalities. A key aspect is the tendency of Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) to learn texture-based features, which limits their performance when
applied to new domains with different visual characteristics. We hypothesize
that leveraging geometric priors of vessel shapes, such as their tubular and
branching nature, can lead to more robust and data-efficient models. To
investigate this, we introduce VessShape, a methodology for generating
large-scale 2D synthetic datasets designed to instill a shape bias in
segmentation models. VessShape images contain procedurally generated tubular
geometries combined with a wide variety of foreground and background textures,
encouraging models to learn shape cues rather than textures. We demonstrate
that a model pre-trained on VessShape images achieves strong few-shot
segmentation performance on two real-world datasets from different domains,
requiring only four to ten samples for fine-tuning. Furthermore, the model
exhibits notable zero-shot capabilities, effectively segmenting vessels in
unseen domains without any target-specific training. Our results indicate that
pre-training with a strong shape bias can be an effective strategy to overcome
data scarcity and improve model generalization in blood vessel segmentation.

Result: NegoCollab有效减少了域差距，提升了协作感知的性能。

Conclusion: NegoCollab通过协商共同表示和多模态对齐损失，解决了异构协作中的域差距问题。

Abstract: Collaborative perception improves task performance by expanding the
perception range through information sharing among agents. . Immutable
heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as
participating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This
leads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,
consequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all
agents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training
cost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as
the representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with
significant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper
alignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method
based on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator
during training to derive the common representation from the local
representations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent
domain gap with the various local representations. In NegoCollab, the mutual
transformation of features between the local representation space and the
common representation space is achieved by a pair of sender and receiver. To
better align local representations to the common representation containing
multimodal information, we introduce structural alignment loss and pragmatic
alignment loss in addition to the distribution alignment loss to supervise the
training. This enables the knowledge in the common representation to be fully
distilled into the sender.

Motivation: 现有IoU和Wasserstein距离在小物体检测中存在敏感性和尺度不变性不足的问题，影响了模型性能。

Method: 提出Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD)，通过分析其梯度和特性，证明其具有尺度不变性和联合优化能力。

Result: 在AI-TOD-v2、MS-COCO-2017和Visdrone-2019数据集上，GCD作为损失函数和标签分配指标，表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GCD是一种有效的相似性度量方法，能够提升小物体检测的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly
enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the
most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a
similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of
their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent
studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for
measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we
have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which
negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when
used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes
leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).
Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD
not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,
which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the
AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box
regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art
performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability
of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the
Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets. Code is available at

Result: 在多种显微镜技术中显著降低噪声，提升分辨率和分析准确性。

Conclusion: 深度去噪是一种强大的通用增强方法，可扩展噪声受限技术的应用范围。

Abstract: Operando microscopy provides direct insight into the dynamic chemical and
physical processes that govern functional materials, yet measurement noise
limits the effective resolution and undermines quantitative analysis. Here, we
present a general framework for integrating unsupervised deep learning-based
denoising into quantitative microscopy workflows across modalities and length
scales. Using simulated data, we demonstrate that deep denoising preserves
physical fidelity, introduces minimal bias, and reduces uncertainty in model
learning with partial differential equation (PDE)-constrained optimization.
Applied to experiments, denoising reveals nanoscale chemical and structural
heterogeneity in scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) of lithium iron
phosphate (LFP), enables automated particle segmentation and phase
classification in optical microscopy of graphite electrodes, and reduces
noise-induced variability by nearly 80% in neutron radiography to resolve
heterogeneous lithium transport. Collectively, these results establish deep
denoising as a powerful, modality-agnostic enhancement that advances
quantitative operando imaging and extends the reach of previously noise-limited
techniques.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) in surveillance is challenged by occlusion,
viewpoint distortion, and poor image quality. Most existing methods rely on
complex modules or perform well only on clear frontal images. We propose Sh-ViT
(Shuffling Vision Transformer), a lightweight and robust model for occluded
person ReID. Built on ViT-Base, Sh-ViT introduces three components: First, a
Shuffle module in the final Transformer layer to break spatial correlations and
enhance robustness to occlusion and blur; Second, scenario-adapted augmentation
(geometric transforms, erasing, blur, and color adjustment) to simulate
surveillance conditions; Third, DeiT-based knowledge distillation to improve
learning with limited labels.To support real-world evaluation, we construct the
MyTT dataset, containing over 10,000 pedestrians and 30,000+ images from base
station inspections, with frequent equipment occlusion and camera variations.
Experiments show that Sh-ViT achieves 83.2% Rank-1 and 80.1% mAP on MyTT,
outperforming CNN and ViT baselines, and 94.6% Rank-1 and 87.5% mAP on
Market1501, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.In summary, Sh-ViT improves
robustness to occlusion and blur without external modules, offering a practical
solution for surveillance-based personnel monitoring.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled impressive
multimodal reasoning, yet most medical applications remain limited to 2D
imaging. In this work, we extend VLMs to 3D positron emission tomography and
computed tomography (PET/CT), a domain characterized by large volumetric data,
small and dispersed lesions, and lengthy radiology reports. We introduce a
large-scale dataset comprising over 11,000 lesion-level descriptions paired
with 3D segmentations from more than 5,000 PET/CT exams, extracted via a hybrid
rule-based and large language model (LLM) pipeline. Building upon this dataset,
we propose PETAR-4B, a 3D mask-aware vision-language model that integrates PET,
CT, and lesion contours for spatially grounded report generation. PETAR bridges
global contextual reasoning with fine-grained lesion awareness, producing
clinically coherent and localized findings. Comprehensive automated and human
evaluations demonstrate that PETAR substantially improves PET/CT report
generation quality, advancing 3D medical vision-language understanding.

Motivation: 解决DMD在复杂生成任务（如文本到视频生成）中因模型容量限制而表现不佳的问题，同时避免多步蒸馏带来的内存和计算效率问题。

Method: 提出Phased DMD，通过渐进分布匹配和子区间内的分数匹配，分阶段优化模型，并结合MoE增强模型容量。

Result: 实验验证了Phased DMD在图像和视频生成任务中优于DMD，保留了输出多样性并保持生成能力。

Conclusion: Phased DMD是一种高效的多步蒸馏方法，适用于复杂生成任务，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) distills score-based generative
models into efficient one-step generators, without requiring a one-to-one
correspondence with the sampling trajectories of their teachers. However,
limited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex
generative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video
generation. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory
usage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.
While prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential
solution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of
multi-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step
counterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step
distillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model
capacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution
matching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the
SNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR
levels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training
objective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous
mathematical derivations. We validate Phased DMD by distilling state-of-the-art
image and video generation models, including Qwen-Image (20B parameters) and
Wan2.2 (28B parameters). Experimental results demonstrate that Phased DMD
preserves output diversity better than DMD while retaining key generative
capabilities. We will release our code and models.

Abstract: Non-contact electrocardiogram (ECG) reconstruction from radar signals offers
a promising approach for unobtrusive cardiac monitoring. We present LifWavNet,
a lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis
(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use
fixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with
lifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features
and synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve
reconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier
transform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in
both temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets
demonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG
reconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate
variability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the
interpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in
radar-to-ECG reconstruction. These results establish LifWavNet as a robust
framework for radar-based non-contact ECG measurement.

Abstract: We present force characterizations of two newly developed insect-scale
propulsors--one single-tailed and one double-tailed--for microrobotic swimmers
that leverage fluid-structure interaction (FSI) to generate thrust. The designs
of these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by
soft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory
alloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable
for microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures
for trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics
and magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.
In the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the
notion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization
using a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and
cycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and
2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail
propulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test
means of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively. These results represent the
first measurements of the instantaneous thrust generated by insect-scale
propulsors of this type and provide insights into FSI for efficient
microrobotic propulsion.

Abstract: Maze-like environments, such as cave and pipe networks, pose unique
challenges for multiple robots to coordinate, including communication
constraints and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a
distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be
represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one
agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the
other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to
neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a
single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in
simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple
single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive,
or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The
algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and
sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of
makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it
is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to
either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots
confirm the feasibility of the approach.

Abstract: Vision-language models demonstrate unprecedented performance and
generalization across a wide range of tasks and scenarios. Integrating these
foundation models into robotic navigation systems opens pathways toward
building general-purpose robots. Yet, evaluating these models' navigation
capabilities remains constrained by costly real-world trials, overly simplified
simulations, and limited benchmarks. We introduce NaviTrace, a high-quality
Visual Question Answering benchmark where a model receives an instruction and
embodiment type (human, legged robot, wheeled robot, bicycle) and must output a
2D navigation trace in image space. Across 1000 scenarios and more than 3000
expert traces, we systematically evaluate eight state-of-the-art VLMs using a
newly introduced semantic-aware trace score. This metric combines Dynamic Time
Warping distance, goal endpoint error, and embodiment-conditioned penalties
derived from per-pixel semantics and correlates with human preferences. Our
evaluation reveals consistent gap to human performance caused by poor spatial
grounding and goal localization. NaviTrace establishes a scalable and

Conclusion: SPINE-HT框架有效提升了异构机器人团队在非结构化环境中的任务执行能力。

Abstract: Heterogeneous robot teams operating in realistic settings often must
accomplish complex missions requiring collaboration and adaptation to
information acquired online. Because robot teams frequently operate in
unstructured environments -- uncertain, open-world settings without prior maps
-- subtasks must be grounded in robot capabilities and the physical world.
While heterogeneous teams have typically been designed for fixed
specifications, generative intelligence opens the possibility of teams that can
accomplish a wide range of missions described in natural language. However,
current large language model (LLM)-enabled teaming methods typically assume
well-structured and known environments, limiting deployment in unstructured
environments. We present SPINE-HT, a framework that addresses these limitations
by grounding the reasoning abilities of LLMs in the context of a heterogeneous
robot team through a three-stage process. Given language specifications
describing mission goals and team capabilities, an LLM generates grounded
subtasks which are validated for feasibility. Subtasks are then assigned to
robots based on capabilities such as traversability or perception and refined
given feedback collected during online operation. In simulation experiments
with closed-loop perception and control, our framework achieves nearly twice
the success rate compared to prior LLM-enabled heterogeneous teaming
approaches. In real-world experiments with a Clearpath Jackal, a Clearpath
Husky, a Boston Dynamics Spot, and a high-altitude UAV, our method achieves an
87\% success rate in missions requiring reasoning about robot capabilities and
refining subtasks with online feedback. More information is provided at

Conclusion: RepV展示了安全可分离潜在空间在神经符号计划验证中的可扩展性和可靠性。

Abstract: As AI systems migrate to safety-critical domains, verifying that their
actions comply with well-defined rules remains a challenge. Formal methods
provide provable guarantees but demand hand-crafted temporal-logic
specifications, offering limited expressiveness and accessibility. Deep
learning approaches enable evaluation of plans against natural-language
constraints, yet their opaque decision process invites misclassifications with
potentially severe consequences. We introduce RepV, a neurosymbolic verifier
that unifies both views by learning a latent space where safe and unsafe plans
are linearly separable. Starting from a modest seed set of plans labeled by an
off-the-shelf model checker, RepV trains a lightweight projector that embeds
each plan, together with a language model-generated rationale, into a
low-dimensional space; a frozen linear boundary then verifies compliance for
unseen natural-language rules in a single forward pass.
  Beyond binary classification, RepV provides a probabilistic guarantee on the
likelihood of correct verification based on its position in the latent space.
This guarantee enables a guarantee-driven refinement of the planner, improving
rule compliance without human annotations. Empirical evaluations show that RepV
improves compliance prediction accuracy by up to 15% compared to baseline
methods while adding fewer than 0.2M parameters. Furthermore, our refinement
framework outperforms ordinary fine-tuning baselines across various planning
domains. These results show that safety-separable latent spaces offer a

Abstract: Rehabilitation of aging pipes requires accurate condition assessment and
mapping far into the pipe interiors. Soft growing vine robot systems are
particularly promising for navigating confined, sinuous paths such as in pipes,
but are currently limited by complex subsystems and a lack of validation in
real-world industrial settings. In this paper, we introduce the concept and
implementation of a hermetic and transparent vine robot system for visual
condition assessment and mapping within non-branching pipes. This design
encloses all mechanical and electrical components within the vine robot's soft,
airtight, and transparent body, protecting them from environmental interference
while enabling visual sensing. Because this approach requires an enclosed
mechanism for transporting sensors, we developed, modeled, and tested a
passively adapting enclosed tip mount. Finally, we validated the hermetic and
transparent vine robot system concept through a real-world condition assessment
and mapping task in a wastewater pipe. This work advances the use of
soft-growing vine robots in pipe inspection by developing and demonstrating a
robust, streamlined, field-validated system suitable for continued development
and deployment.

Abstract: Visual reasoning, particularly spatial reasoning, is a challenging cognitive
task that requires understanding object relationships and their interactions
within complex environments, especially in robotics domain. Existing
vision_language models (VLMs) excel at perception tasks but struggle with
fine-grained spatial reasoning due to their implicit, correlation-driven
reasoning and reliance solely on images. We propose a novel neuro_symbolic
framework that integrates both panoramic-image and 3D point cloud information,
combining neural perception with symbolic reasoning to explicitly model spatial
and logical relationships. Our framework consists of a perception module for
detecting entities and extracting attributes, and a reasoning module that
constructs a structured scene graph to support precise, interpretable queries.
Evaluated on the JRDB-Reasoning dataset, our approach demonstrates superior
performance and reliability in crowded, human_built environments while
maintaining a lightweight design suitable for robotics and embodied AI
applications.

Conclusion: SpikeATac及其学习框架成功实现了对易碎物体的精细操作，展示了多模态触觉传感在机器人应用中的潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce SpikeATac, a multimodal tactile finger combining a
taxelized and highly sensitive dynamic response (PVDF) with a static
transduction method (capacitive) for multimodal touch sensing. Named for its
`spiky' response, SpikeATac's 16-taxel PVDF film sampled at 4 kHz provides
fast, sensitive dynamic signals to the very onset and breaking of contact. We
characterize the sensitivity of the different modalities, and show that
SpikeATac provides the ability to stop quickly and delicately when grasping
fragile, deformable objects. Beyond parallel grasping, we show that SpikeATac
can be used in a learning-based framework to achieve new capabilities on a
dexterous multifingered robot hand. We use a learning recipe that combines
reinforcement learning from human feedback with tactile-based rewards to
fine-tune the behavior of a policy to modulate force. Our hardware platform and
learning pipeline together enable a difficult dexterous and contact-rich task
that has not previously been achieved: in-hand manipulation of fragile objects.

Method: 提出Dynamics-Aligned Flow Matching Policy (DAP)，通过策略和动力学模型在动作生成过程中相互提供纠正反馈，实现自我纠正和更好的泛化。

Result: 在真实世界机器人操控任务中，DAP的泛化性能优于基线方法，尤其在视觉干扰和光照变化等OOD场景中表现出色。

Conclusion: DAP通过整合动力学预测和策略学习，显著提升了机器人操控任务的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Behavior cloning methods for robot learning suffer from poor generalization
due to limited data support beyond expert demonstrations. Recent approaches
leveraging video prediction models have shown promising results by learning
rich spatiotemporal representations from large-scale datasets. However, these
models learn action-agnostic dynamics that cannot distinguish between different
control inputs, limiting their utility for precise manipulation tasks and
requiring large pretraining datasets. We propose a Dynamics-Aligned Flow
Matching Policy (DAP) that integrates dynamics prediction into policy learning.
Our method introduces a novel architecture where policy and dynamics models
provide mutual corrective feedback during action generation, enabling
self-correction and improved generalization. Empirical validation demonstrates
generalization performance superior to baseline methods on real-world robotic
manipulation tasks, showing particular robustness in OOD scenarios including
visual distractions and lighting variations.

Abstract: Positioning of underwater robots in confined and cluttered spaces remains a
key challenge for field operations. Existing systems are mostly designed for
large, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor
coverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich
surroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further
degrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily
deployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;
however, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting
underwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic
Positioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor
fusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the "mother-ship" concept,
the surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a
submerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly
constrained environments. The system is validated in a large test tank through
repeatable autonomous missions using CAP's position estimates for real-time
trajectory control. Experimental results demonstrate a mean Euclidean distance
(MED) error of 70 mm, achieved in real time without requiring fixed
infrastructure, extensive calibration, or environmental features. CAP leverages
advances in mobile robot sensing and leader-follower control to deliver a step
change in accurate, practical, and infrastructure-free underwater localization.

Result: 实验显示，对接后的系统在动态稳定性（RMS加速度和急动度更低）和操作效率（任务完成更快、角度精度更高）上优于独立协作的机器人。

Conclusion: 物理重构是简化协作控制、提升稳定性和性能的有效设计原则。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems, particularly mobile manipulators, face challenges in
control coordination and dynamic stability when working together. To address
this issue, this study proposes MobiDock, a modular self-reconfigurable mobile
manipulator system that allows two independent robots to physically connect and
form a unified mobile bimanual platform. This process helps transform a complex
multi-robot control problem into the management of a simpler, single system.
The system utilizes an autonomous docking strategy based on computer vision
with AprilTag markers and a new threaded screw-lock mechanism. Experimental
results show that the docked configuration demonstrates better performance in
dynamic stability and operational efficiency compared to two independently
cooperating robots. Specifically, the unified system has lower Root Mean Square
(RMS) Acceleration and Jerk values, higher angular precision, and completes
tasks significantly faster. These findings confirm that physical
reconfiguration is a powerful design principle that simplifies cooperative
control, improving stability and performance for complex tasks in real-world
environments.

Result: 实验表明增加气压可提升摩擦系数，稳定抓取重物、易碎物且减少损伤。

Conclusion: 混合夹爪提供了一种比高法向力更安全灵活的抓取方案。

Abstract: Grasping objects with diverse mechanical properties, such as heavy, slippery,
or fragile items, remains a significant challenge in robotics. Conventional
grippers often rely on applying high normal forces, which can cause damage to
objects. To address this limitation, we present a hybrid gripper finger that
combines a rigid structural shell with a soft, inflatable silicone pocket. The
gripper finger can actively modulate its surface friction by controlling the
internal air pressure of the silicone pocket. Results from fundamental
experiments indicate that increasing the internal pressure results in a
proportional increase in the effective coefficient of friction. This enables
the gripper to stably lift heavy and slippery objects without increasing the
gripping force and to handle fragile or deformable objects, such as eggs,
fruits, and paper cups, with minimal damage by increasing friction rather than
applying excessive force. The experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid
gripper finger with adaptable friction provides a robust and safer alternative
to relying solely on high normal forces, thereby enhancing the gripper
flexibility in handling delicate, fragile, and diverse objects.

Method: 利用向量化表示和计算，避免数值优化中的依赖关系。

Result: VOPP比现有并行求解器效率高20倍。

Conclusion: VOPP为大规模并行POMDP求解提供了高效方案。

Abstract: Planning under partial observability is an essential capability of autonomous
robots. The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) provides a
powerful framework for planning under partial observability problems, capturing
the stochastic effects of actions and the limited information available through
noisy observations. POMDP solving could benefit tremendously from massive
parallelization of today's hardware, but parallelizing POMDP solvers has been
challenging. They rely on interleaving numerical optimization over actions with
the estimation of their values, which creates dependencies and synchronization
bottlenecks between parallel processes that can quickly offset the benefits of
parallelization. In this paper, we propose Vectorized Online POMDP Planner
(VOPP), a novel parallel online solver that leverages a recent POMDP
formulation that analytically solves part of the optimization component,
leaving only the estimation of expectations for numerical computation. VOPP
represents all data structures related to planning as a collection of tensors
and implements all planning steps as fully vectorized computations over this
representation. The result is a massively parallel solver with no dependencies
and synchronization bottlenecks between parallel computations. Experimental
results indicate that VOPP is at least 20X more efficient in computing
near-optimal solutions compared to an existing state-of-the-art parallel online
solver.

architecture emphasizes seamless integration of hardware components by
introducing independent ROS 2 nodes for each component of a Unmanned Aerial
Vehicle (UAV). Communication between swarm participants is abstracted in
software, allowing the use of various technologies without architectural
changes. Key functionalities are supported, e.g. leader following and formation
flight to maneuver the swarm. The system also allows computer vision algorithms
to be integrated for the detection and tracking of UAVs. Additionally, a ground
station control is integrated for the coordination of swarm operations.
Swarm-based Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) architecture is verified within a

Result: MEI在量化临界性和捕捉风险演变方面优于ACT和PET。

Conclusion: MEI是评估城市冲突和增强自动驾驶安全框架的有前景的指标。

Abstract: Effective, reliable, and efficient evaluation of autonomous driving safety is
essential to demonstrate its trustworthiness. Criticality metrics provide an
objective means of assessing safety. However, as existing metrics primarily
target longitudinal conflicts, accurately quantifying the risks of lateral
conflicts - prevalent in urban settings - remains challenging. This paper
proposes the Modified-Emergency Index (MEI), a metric designed to quantify
evasive effort in lateral conflicts. Compared to the original Emergency Index
(EI), MEI refines the estimation of the time available for evasive maneuvers,
enabling more precise risk quantification. We validate MEI on a public lateral
conflict dataset based on Argoverse-2, from which we extract over 1,500
high-quality AV conflict cases, including more than 500 critical events. MEI is
then compared with the well-established ACT and the widely used PET metrics.
Results show that MEI consistently outperforms them in accurately quantifying
criticality and capturing risk evolution. Overall, these findings highlight MEI
as a promising metric for evaluating urban conflicts and enhancing the safety
assessment framework for autonomous driving. The open-source implementation is
available at https://github.com/AutoChengh/MEI.

Abstract: Multi-embodiment grasping focuses on developing approaches that exhibit
generalist behavior across diverse gripper designs. Existing methods often
learn the kinematic structure of the robot implicitly and face challenges due
to the difficulty of sourcing the required large-scale data. In this work, we
present a data-efficient, flow-based, equivariant grasp synthesis architecture
that can handle different gripper types with variable degrees of freedom and
successfully exploit the underlying kinematic model, deducing all necessary
information solely from the gripper and scene geometry. Unlike previous
equivariant grasping methods, we translated all modules from the ground up to
JAX and provide a model with batching capabilities over scenes, grippers, and
grasps, resulting in smoother learning, improved performance and faster
inference time. Our dataset encompasses grippers ranging from humanoid hands to
parallel yaw grippers and includes 25,000 scenes and 20 million grasps.

Conclusion: 不确定性驱动的主动探索可生成可扩展、可重用的动力学模型，推动软体机器人控制的自主性和适应性。

Abstract: Soft robots offer unmatched adaptability and safety in unstructured
environments, yet their compliant, high-dimensional, and nonlinear dynamics
make modeling for control notoriously difficult. Existing data-driven
approaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task
demonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an
uncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns
task-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems. SoftAE
employs probabilistic ensemble models to estimate epistemic uncertainty and
actively guides exploration toward underrepresented regions of the state-action
space, achieving efficient coverage of diverse behaviors without task-specific
supervision. We evaluate SoftAE on three simulated soft robotic platforms -- a
continuum arm, an articulated fish in fluid, and a musculoskeletal leg with
hybrid actuation -- and on a pneumatically actuated continuum soft arm in the
real world. Compared with random exploration and task-specific model-based
reinforcement learning, SoftAE produces more accurate dynamics models, enables
superior zero-shot control on unseen tasks, and maintains robustness under
sensing noise, actuation delays, and nonlinear material effects. These results
demonstrate that uncertainty-driven active exploration can yield scalable,
reusable dynamics models across diverse soft robotic morphologies, representing
a step toward more autonomous, adaptable, and data-efficient control in
compliant robots.

Abstract: Human-robot interaction frequently involves physical proximity or contact. In
human-human settings, people flexibly accept, reject, or tolerate such
approaches depending on the relationship and context. We explore the design of
a robot's rejective internal state and corresponding avoidance behaviors, such
as withdrawing or pushing away, when a person approaches. We model the
accumulation and decay of discomfort as a function of interpersonal distance,
and implement tolerance (endurance) and limit-exceeding avoidance driven by the
Dominance axis of the PAD affect model. The behaviors and their intensities are
realized on an arm robot. Results illustrate a coherent pipeline from internal
state parameters to graded endurance motions and, once a limit is crossed, to
avoidance actions.

Result: 在模拟和真实任务中，EBT-Policy性能优于扩散策略，训练和推理计算需求更低，且具备零样本恢复等新能力。

Conclusion: EBT-Policy为分布偏移下鲁棒、通用的机器人行为提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit policies parameterized by generative models, such as Diffusion
Policy, have become the standard for policy learning and Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models in robotics. However, these approaches often suffer from high
computational cost, exposure bias, and unstable inference dynamics, which lead
to divergence under distribution shifts. Energy-Based Models (EBMs) address
these issues by learning energy landscapes end-to-end and modeling equilibrium
dynamics, offering improved robustness and reduced exposure bias. Yet, policies
parameterized by EBMs have historically struggled to scale effectively. Recent
work on Energy-Based Transformers (EBTs) demonstrates the scalability of EBMs
to high-dimensional spaces, but their potential for solving core challenges in
physically embodied models remains underexplored. We introduce a new
energy-based architecture, EBT-Policy, that solves core issues in robotic and
real-world settings. Across simulated and real-world tasks, EBT-Policy
consistently outperforms diffusion-based policies, while requiring less
training and inference computation. Remarkably, on some tasks it converges
within just two inference steps, a 50x reduction compared to Diffusion Policy's
100. Moreover, EBT-Policy exhibits emergent capabilities not seen in prior
models, such as zero-shot recovery from failed action sequences using only
behavior cloning and without explicit retry training. By leveraging its scalar
energy for uncertainty-aware inference and dynamic compute allocation,
EBT-Policy offers a promising path toward robust, generalizable robot behavior
under distribution shifts.

Abstract: Biological systems, such as the octopus, exhibit masterful cross-scale
manipulation by adaptively reconfiguring their entire form, a capability that
remains elusive in robotics. Conventional soft grippers, while compliant, are
mostly constrained by a fixed global morphology, and prior shape-morphing
efforts have been largely confined to localized deformations, failing to
replicate this biological dexterity. Inspired by this natural exemplar, we
introduce the paradigm of collaborative, whole-body proprioceptive morphing,
realized in a modular soft gripper architecture. Our design is a distributed
network of modular self-sensing pneumatic actuators that enables the gripper to
intelligently reconfigure its entire topology, achieving multiple morphing
states that are controllable to form diverse polygonal shapes. By integrating
rich proprioceptive feedback from embedded sensors, our system can seamlessly
transition from a precise pinch to a large envelope grasp. We experimentally
demonstrate that this approach expands the grasping envelope and enhances
generalization across diverse object geometries (standard and irregular) and
scales (up to 10$\times$), while also unlocking novel manipulation modalities
such as multi-object and internal hook grasping. This work presents a low-cost,
easy-to-fabricate, and scalable framework that fuses distributed actuation with
integrated sensing, offering a new pathway toward achieving biological levels
of dexterity in robotic manipulation.

TL;DR: 论文研究了持续预训练中大型语言模型（LLMs）对虚假信息的易感性，发现即使少量虚假数据也会导致模型内部表征的持久漂移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索持续预训练中LLMs是否像人类一样容易因重复接触虚假信息而改变对事实的信念。

Method: 提出Layer of Truth框架和数据集，通过注入受控的虚假数据并探测中间表征，量化事实信念的变化。

Result: 研究发现，即使少量虚假信息也会导致模型对已确立事实的表征漂移，且易感性因模型层数和规模而异。

Conclusion: 持续更新的LLMs存在被虚假信息同化的风险，需在模型更新时加强事实完整性的监控。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continually evolve through pre-training on
ever-expanding web data, but this adaptive process also exposes them to subtle
forms of misinformation. While prior work has explored data poisoning during
static pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual
pre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory
truth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods
increases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar
vulnerability. We investigate whether repeated exposure to false but
confidently stated facts can shift a model's internal representation away from
the truth.
  We introduce Layer of Truth, a framework and dataset for probing belief
dynamics in continually trained LLMs. By injecting controlled amounts of
poisoned data and probing intermediate representations across checkpoints,
model scales, and question types, we quantify when and how factual beliefs
shift. Our findings reveal that even minimal exposure can induce persistent
representational drift in well-established facts, with susceptibility varying
across layers and model sizes. These results highlight an overlooked
vulnerability of continually updated LLMs: their capacity to internalize
misinformation analogously to humans, underscoring the need for robust
monitoring of factual integrity during model updates.

*Guangzhi Su,Shuchang Huang,Yutong Ke,Zhuohang Liu,Long Qian,Kaizhu Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SmoothGuard是一种轻量级、模型无关的防御框架，通过随机噪声注入和基于聚类的预测聚合增强多模态大语言模型的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在对抗性攻击下表现脆弱，需要提升其安全性和可靠性。

Method: 通过高斯噪声扰动连续模态（如图像和音频），生成多个候选输出，并基于嵌入聚类过滤对抗性预测，最终选择多数簇的答案。

Result: 在POPE、LLaVA-Bench和MM-SafetyBench上的实验表明，SmoothGuard显著提升了对抗攻击的鲁棒性，同时保持实用性。

Conclusion: SmoothGuard是一种有效的防御框架，噪声范围0.1-0.2在鲁棒性和实用性之间达到最佳平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved impressive performance
across diverse tasks by jointly reasoning over textual and visual inputs.
Despite their success, these models remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
manipulations, raising concerns about their safety and reliability in
deployment. In this work, we first generalize an approach for generating
adversarial images within the HuggingFace ecosystem and then introduce
SmoothGuard, a lightweight and model-agnostic defense framework that enhances
the robustness of MLLMs through randomized noise injection and clustering-based
prediction aggregation. Our method perturbs continuous modalities (e.g., images
and audio) with Gaussian noise, generates multiple candidate outputs, and
applies embedding-based clustering to filter out adversarially influenced
predictions. The final answer is selected from the majority cluster, ensuring
stable responses even under malicious perturbations. Extensive experiments on
POPE, LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild), and MM-SafetyBench demonstrate that
SmoothGuard improves resilience to adversarial attacks while maintaining
competitive utility. Ablation studies further identify an optimal noise range
(0.1-0.2) that balances robustness and utility.

*Kangkang Sun,Jun Wu,Minyi Guo,Jianhua Li,Jianwei Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种差分隐私公平联邦学习算法（FedPF），揭示了隐私与公平之间的固有矛盾，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中同时确保公平性和隐私保护的挑战。

Method: 将多目标优化转化为零和博弈，通过理论分析和实验验证。

Result: 在三个数据集上实现了高达42.9%的歧视减少，同时保持竞争力准确性。

Conclusion: 隐私与公平之间存在不可避免的张力，需要平衡而非单独优化。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without data
sharing, yet participants face a fundamental challenge, e.g., simultaneously
ensuring fairness across demographic groups while protecting sensitive client
data. We introduce a differentially private fair FL algorithm (\textit{FedPF})
that transforms this multi-objective optimization into a zero-sum game where
fairness and privacy constraints compete against model utility. Our theoretical
analysis reveals a surprising inverse relationship, i.e., stricter privacy
protection fundamentally limits the system's ability to detect and correct
demographic biases, creating an inherent tension between privacy and fairness.
Counterintuitively, we prove that moderate fairness constraints initially
improve model generalization before causing performance degradation, where a
non-monotonic relationship that challenges conventional wisdom about
fairness-utility tradeoffs. Experimental validation demonstrates up to 42.9 %
discrimination reduction across three datasets while maintaining competitive
accuracy, but more importantly, reveals that the privacy-fairness tension is
unavoidable, i.e., achieving both objectives simultaneously requires carefully
balanced compromises rather than optimization of either in isolation. The
source code for our proposed algorithm is publicly accessible at
https://github.com/szpsunkk/FedPF.

TL;DR: CAS-Spec是一种新型的自推测解码方法，通过动态切换推理加速策略和动态树级联算法，显著提升了大型语言模型的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自推测解码方法在速度和灵活性上存在不足，而传统级联方法训练成本高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出CAS-Spec方法，结合动态切换推理加速策略（如层稀疏和激活量化）和动态树级联算法（DyTC），自适应分配草稿模型和长度。

Result: CAS-Spec在多种LLM和数据集上实现了1.1×到2.3×的加速，DyTC算法比基线方法提升了47%和48%的速度。

Conclusion: CAS-Spec易于集成到现有LLM中，并具有进一步加速的潜力。

Abstract: Speculative decoding has become a widely adopted as an effective technique
for lossless inference acceleration when deploying large language models
(LLMs). While on-the-fly self-speculative methods offer seamless integration
and broad utility, they often fall short of the speed gains achieved by methods
relying on specialized training. Cascading a hierarchy of draft models promises
further acceleration and flexibility, but the high cost of training multiple
models has limited its practical application. In this paper, we propose a novel
Cascade Adaptive Self-Speculative Decoding (CAS-Spec) method which constructs
speculative draft models by leveraging dynamically switchable inference
acceleration (DSIA) strategies, including layer sparsity and activation
quantization. Furthermore, traditional vertical and horizontal cascade
algorithms are inefficient when applied to self-speculative decoding methods.
We introduce a Dynamic Tree Cascade (DyTC) algorithm that adaptively routes the
multi-level draft models and assigns the draft lengths, based on the heuristics
of acceptance rates and latency prediction. Our CAS-Spec method achieves
state-of-the-art acceleration compared to existing on-the-fly speculative
decoding methods, with an average speedup from $1.1\times$ to $2.3\times$ over
autoregressive decoding across various LLMs and datasets. DyTC improves the
average speedup by $47$\% and $48$\% over cascade-based baseline and tree-based
baseline algorithms, respectively. CAS-Spec can be easily integrated into most
existing LLMs and holds promising potential for further acceleration as
self-speculative decoding techniques continue to evolve.

TL;DR: BI-DCGAN是一种贝叶斯扩展的DCGAN，通过引入模型不确定性解决GAN的模式崩溃问题，提升生成样本的多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN在生成合成数据时存在模式崩溃问题，导致生成样本多样性不足，而实际应用需要多样性和不确定性感知。

Method: BI-DCGAN结合Bayes by Backprop学习网络权重的分布，并使用均值场变分推断近似后验分布。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，BI-DCGAN比传统DCGAN生成更多样化和鲁棒的样本，同时保持训练效率。

Conclusion: BI-DCGAN为需要多样性和不确定性的应用提供了可扩展的解决方案，尤其在资源受限时优于扩散模型。

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are proficient at generating synthetic
data but continue to suffer from mode collapse, where the generator produces a
narrow range of outputs that fool the discriminator but fail to capture the
full data distribution. This limitation is particularly problematic, as
generative models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications that
demand both diversity and uncertainty awareness. In response, we introduce
BI-DCGAN, a Bayesian extension of DCGAN that incorporates model uncertainty
into the generative process while maintaining computational efficiency.
BI-DCGAN integrates Bayes by Backprop to learn a distribution over network
weights and employs mean-field variational inference to efficiently approximate
the posterior distribution during GAN training. We establishes the first
theoretical proof, based on covariance matrix analysis, that Bayesian modeling
enhances sample diversity in GANs. We validate this theoretical result through
extensive experiments on standard generative benchmarks, demonstrating that
BI-DCGAN produces more diverse and robust outputs than conventional DCGANs,
while maintaining training efficiency. These findings position BI-DCGAN as a
scalable and timely solution for applications where both diversity and
uncertainty are critical, and where modern alternatives like diffusion models
remain too resource-intensive.

Abstract: This work presents an ontology-integrated large language model (LLM)
framework for chemical engineering that unites structured domain knowledge with
generative reasoning. The proposed pipeline aligns model training and inference
with the COPE ontology through a sequence of data acquisition, semantic
preprocessing, information extraction, and ontology mapping steps, producing
templated question-answer pairs that guide fine-tuning. A control-focused
decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by
constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics
quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future
extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further
enhance the system's interpretability and reliability. This integration of
symbolic structure and neural generation provides a transparent, auditable
approach for applying LLMs to process control, safety analysis, and other
critical engineering contexts.

Conclusion: 该框架为基础设施分段提供预测性能基础，帮助运营商降低成本、优化能源策略，支持电网韧性。

Abstract: The decarbonization of transportation relies on the widespread adoption of
electric vehicles (EVs), which requires an accurate understanding of charging
behavior to ensure cost-effective, grid-resilient infrastructure. Existing work
is constrained by small-scale datasets, simple proximity-based modeling of
temporal dependencies, and weak generalization to sites with limited
operational history. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a
framework that integrates clustering with few-shot forecasting to uncover site
archetypes using a novel large-scale dataset of charging demand. The results
demonstrate that archetype-specific expert models outperform global baselines
in forecasting demand at unseen sites. By establishing forecast performance as
a basis for infrastructure segmentation, we generate actionable insights that
enable operators to lower costs, optimize energy and pricing strategies, and
support grid resilience critical to climate goals.

Conclusion: MM-OPERA为评估和提升LVLMs的关联智能提供了全面且细致的基准，推动了更通用和类人AI的发展。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have exhibited remarkable progress.
However, deficiencies remain compared to human intelligence, such as
hallucination and shallow pattern matching. In this work, we aim to evaluate a
fundamental yet underexplored intelligence: association, a cornerstone of human
cognition for creative thinking and knowledge integration. Current benchmarks,
often limited to closed-ended tasks, fail to capture the complexity of
open-ended association reasoning vital for real-world applications. To address
this, we present MM-OPERA, a systematic benchmark with 11,497 instances across
two open-ended tasks: Remote-Item Association (RIA) and In-Context Association
(ICA), aligning association intelligence evaluation with human psychometric
principles. It challenges LVLMs to resemble the spirit of divergent thinking
and convergent associative reasoning through free-form responses and explicit
reasoning paths. We deploy tailored LLM-as-a-Judge strategies to evaluate
open-ended outputs, applying process-reward-informed judgment to dissect
reasoning with precision. Extensive empirical studies on state-of-the-art
LVLMs, including sensitivity analysis of task instances, validity analysis of
LLM-as-a-Judge strategies, and diversity analysis across abilities, domains,
languages, cultures, etc., provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of
the limitations of current LVLMs in associative reasoning, paving the way for
more human-like and general-purpose AI. The dataset and code are available at

Conclusion: 研究揭示了移动预测中的结构性不平等，并展示了轻量级数据干预如何在低资源设置下提升公平性。

Abstract: Next location prediction underpins a growing number of mobility, retail, and
public-health applications, yet its societal impacts remain largely unexplored.
In this paper, we audit state-of-the-art mobility prediction models trained on
a large-scale dataset, highlighting hidden disparities based on user
demographics. Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in
predictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic
disparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences
in accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose
Fairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy
designed for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level
demographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a
clustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while
enforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for
the four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built
on these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected
performance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally
constructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while
preserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups
by up to 40\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art
MetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most
significant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for
fairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource
settings. Our findings expose structural inequities in mobility prediction
pipelines and demonstrate how lightweight, data-centric interventions can
improve fairness with little added complexity, especially for low-data
applications.

Motivation: 原始图灵测试已不足以区分人类与机器智能，且AI的发展引发了伦理和环境问题，需要更新测试标准。

Method: 在原有模仿游戏基础上，增加能量消耗作为约束条件，评估智能的效率。

Result: 新测试通过量化资源成本，为智能评估提供了可测量的实际标准。

Conclusion: 新测试促使社会权衡AI的时间节省与资源成本，更具现实意义。

Abstract: The Turing Test is no longer adequate for distinguishing human and machine
intelligence. With advanced artificial intelligence systems already passing the
original Turing Test and contributing to serious ethical and environmental
concerns, we urgently need to update the test. This work expands upon the
original imitation game by accounting for an additional factor: the energy
spent answering the questions. By adding the constraint of energy, the new test
forces us to evaluate intelligence through the lens of efficiency, connecting
the abstract problem of thinking to the concrete reality of finite resources.
Further, this proposed new test ensures the evaluation of intelligence has a
measurable, practical finish line that the original test lacks. This additional
constraint compels society to weigh the time savings of using artificial
intelligence against its total resource cost.

Motivation: 传统家庭用水监测方法成本高且耗时，研究探索利用公开影像和简单地理空间数据替代。

Method: 比较四种方法：调查特征（基准）、CNN嵌入（卫星、GSV、组合）、GSV语义地图与辅助数据。

Result: GSV分割加遥感协变量准确率达0.55，接近调查模型的0.59。极端用水量预测精度高，但中间类别易混淆。

Conclusion: 公开影像结合少量地理空间数据可替代传统调查，为城市分析提供可靠家庭用水估计。

Abstract: Monitoring household water use in rapidly urbanizing regions is hampered by
costly, time-intensive enumeration methods and surveys. We investigate whether
publicly available imagery-satellite tiles, Google Street View (GSV)
segmentation-and simple geospatial covariates (nightlight intensity, population
density) can be utilized to predict household water consumption in
Hubballi-Dharwad, India. We compare four approaches: survey features
(benchmark), CNN embeddings (satellite, GSV, combined), and GSV semantic maps
with auxiliary data. Under an ordinal classification framework, GSV
segmentation plus remote-sensing covariates achieves 0.55 accuracy for water
use, approaching survey-based models (0.59 accuracy). Error analysis shows high
precision at extremes of the household water consumption distribution, but
confusion among middle classes is due to overlapping visual proxies. We also
compare and contrast our estimates for household water consumption to that of
household subjective income. Our findings demonstrate that open-access imagery,
coupled with minimal geospatial data, offers a promising alternative to
obtaining reliable household water consumption estimates using surveys in urban
analytics.

Motivation: 解决在有限计算资源下如何最大化对抗攻击效果的问题。

Method: 通过选择性重新计算层激活，在迭代和层级上进行细粒度控制。

Result: 在相同成本下优于现有基线，且在对抗训练中仅需30%预算即可达到类似性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在有限计算预算下显著提升对抗攻击效果，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This work tackles a critical challenge in AI safety research under limited
compute: given a fixed computation budget, how can one maximize the strength of
iterative adversarial attacks? Coarsely reducing the number of attack
iterations lowers cost but substantially weakens effectiveness. To fulfill the
attainable attack efficacy within a constrained budget, we propose a
fine-grained control mechanism that selectively recomputes layer activations
across both iteration-wise and layer-wise levels. Extensive experiments show
that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines at equal cost.
Moreover, when integrated into adversarial training, it attains comparable
performance with only 30% of the original budget.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在信息提取中存在冗余、噪声和缺乏对幻觉的量化评估，且未探索模型规模与质量的权衡。

Result: 实验表明HADSF能减少预测误差，并让小模型在部署场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: HADSF为LLM增强的可解释推荐提供了可复现的研究支持。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) promise more effective
information extraction for review-based recommender systems, yet current
methods still (i) mine free-form reviews without scope control, producing
redundant and noisy representations, (ii) lack principled metrics that link LLM
hallucination to downstream effectiveness, and (iii) leave the cost-quality
trade-off across model scales largely unexplored. We address these gaps with
the Hyper-Adaptive Dual-Stage Semantic Framework (HADSF), a two-stage approach
that first induces a compact, corpus-level aspect vocabulary via adaptive
selection and then performs vocabulary-guided, explicitly constrained
extraction of structured aspect-opinion triples. To assess the fidelity of the
resulting representations, we introduce Aspect Drift Rate (ADR) and Opinion
Fidelity Rate (OFR) and empirically uncover a nonmonotonic relationship between
hallucination severity and rating prediction error. Experiments on
approximately 3 million reviews across LLMs spanning 1.5B-70B parameters show
that, when integrated into standard rating predictors, HADSF yields consistent
reductions in prediction error and enables smaller models to achieve
competitive performance in representative deployment scenarios. We release
code, data pipelines, and metric implementations to support reproducible
research on hallucination-aware, LLM-enhanced explainable recommendation. Code

Motivation: 探讨为什么某些学习规则比其他规则更有效，以及在什么假设下可以认为某个规则是最优的。

Method: 将学习规则建模为在部分可观测损失景观中的导航策略，并通过最优控制问题求解最优规则。

Result: 多种常见学习规则（如梯度下降、动量、自然梯度等）在该框架下自然涌现，并揭示了持续学习策略的最优性。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了多种学习现象，为设计自适应算法提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Learning rules -- prescriptions for updating model parameters to improve
performance -- are typically assumed rather than derived. Why do some learning
rules work better than others, and under what assumptions can a given rule be
considered optimal? We propose a theoretical framework that casts learning
rules as policies for navigating (partially observable) loss landscapes, and
identifies optimal rules as solutions to an associated optimal control problem.
A range of well-known rules emerge naturally within this framework under
different assumptions: gradient descent from short-horizon optimization,
momentum from longer-horizon planning, natural gradients from accounting for
parameter space geometry, non-gradient rules from partial controllability, and
adaptive optimizers like Adam from online Bayesian inference of loss landscape
shape. We further show that continual learning strategies like weight resetting
can be understood as optimal responses to task uncertainty. By unifying these
phenomena under a single objective, our framework clarifies the computational
structure of learning and offers a principled foundation for designing adaptive
algorithms.

Result: 方差感知算法在高不确定性环境中表现更优，而经典算法在可分离场景或经过精细调优时表现更好。

Conclusion: 论文贡献包括一个系统评估框架，以及方差感知算法优于经典算法的条件分析。

Abstract: Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems serve as a fundamental building block for
more complex reinforcement learning algorithms. However, evaluating and
comparing MAB algorithms remains challenging due to the lack of standardized
conditions and replicability. This is particularly problematic for
variance-aware extensions of classical methods like UCB, whose performance can
heavily depend on the underlying environment. In this study, we address how
performance differences between bandit algorithms can be reliably observed, and
under what conditions variance-aware algorithms outperform classical ones. We
present a reproducible evaluation designed to systematically compare eight
classical and variance-aware MAB algorithms. The evaluation framework,
implemented in our Bandit Playground codebase, features clearly defined
experimental setups, multiple performance metrics (reward, regret, reward
distribution, value-at-risk, and action optimality), and an interactive
evaluation interface that supports consistent and transparent analysis. We show
that variance-aware algorithms can offer advantages in settings with high
uncertainty where the difficulty arises from subtle differences between arm
rewards. In contrast, classical algorithms often perform equally well or better
in more separable scenarios or if fine-tuned extensively. Our contributions are
twofold: (1) a framework for systematic evaluation of MAB algorithms, and (2)
insights into the conditions under which variance-aware approaches outperform
their classical counterparts.

*Hongbo Li,Qinhang Wu,Sen Lin,Yingbin Liang,Ness B. Shroff*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT)的理论框架，通过连续训练的门控网络实现专家专业化，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)模型缺乏统一的理论解释，尤其是在前馈和注意力层均允许专业化的情况下。

Method: 提出MoT框架，采用三阶段训练算法，通过门控网络实现专家专业化，并分析其学习动态。

Result: 实验证明专家专业化减少了梯度冲突，使每个子任务强凸，训练效率显著提升。

Conclusion: MoT为transformer级专业化和学习动态提供了首个统一理论解释，并为设计高效大规模模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve transformer efficiency but lack a
unified theoretical explanation, especially when both feed-forward and
attention layers are allowed to specialize. To this end, we study the
Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT), a tractable theoretical framework in which each
transformer block acts as an expert governed by a continuously trained gating
network. This design allows us to isolate and study the core learning dynamics
of expert specialization and attention alignment. In particular, we develop a
three-stage training algorithm with continuous training of the gating network,
and show that each transformer expert specializes in a distinct class of tasks
and that the gating network accurately routes data samples to the correct
expert. Our analysis shows how expert specialization reduces gradient conflicts
and makes each subtask strongly convex. We prove that the training drives the
expected prediction loss to near zero in $O(\log(\epsilon^{-1}))$ iteration
steps, significantly improving over the $O(\epsilon^{-1})$ rate for a single
transformer. We further validate our theoretical findings through extensive
real-data experiments, demonstrating the practical effectiveness of MoT.
Together, these results offer the first unified theoretical account of
transformer-level specialization and learning dynamics, providing practical
guidance for designing efficient large-scale models.

Method: 应用CFA整合RoBERTa架构的Transformer模型与传统机器学习模型（如随机森林、SVM和XGBoost），利用秩-得分特征函数量化模型差异并优化组合。

Result: 在IMDB情感分析数据集上达到97.072%的准确率，优于传统集成方法。

Conclusion: CFA通过有效利用模型多样性，提供了一种高效且高性能的情感分类解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to sentiment classification using the
application of Combinatorial Fusion Analysis (CFA) to integrate an ensemble of
diverse machine learning models, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the
IMDB sentiment analysis dataset of 97.072\%. CFA leverages the concept of
cognitive diversity, which utilizes rank-score characteristic functions to
quantify the dissimilarity between models and strategically combine their
predictions. This is in contrast to the common process of scaling the size of
individual models, and thus is comparatively efficient in computing resource
use. Experimental results also indicate that CFA outperforms traditional
ensemble methods by effectively computing and employing model diversity. The
approach in this paper implements the combination of a transformer-based model
of the RoBERTa architecture with traditional machine learning models, including
Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.

*Zachary Izzo,Eshaan Nichani,Jason D. Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了Transformer模型在长度泛化（LG）问题上的表现，首次量化了训练序列长度对泛化的影响，并分析了不同场景下的泛化机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索Transformer模型在训练时未见过的长序列上的表现，填补了Huang等人（2025）研究中关于训练长度阈值的空白。

Method: 分析了多种问题设置，包括误差控制、注意力机制精度和模型层数，通过理论证明和实验验证了泛化条件。

Result: 证明了当Transformer在长序列上的行为可以被训练时的短序列“模拟”时，泛化会发生，并给出了训练长度的定量界限。

Conclusion: 研究深化了对Transformer外推机制的理论理解，并验证了更复杂任务需要更丰富训练数据的直觉。

Abstract: We study the problem of length generalization (LG) in transformers: the
ability of a model trained on shorter sequences to maintain performance when
evaluated on much longer, previously unseen inputs. Prior work by Huang et al.
(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization
once the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open
the question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first
quantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization
to occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG
in several distinct problem settings: $\ell_\infty$ error control vs. average
error control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention
vs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,
and one- vs. two-layer transformers. In all scenarios, we prove that LG occurs
when the internal behavior of the transformer on longer sequences can be
"simulated" by its behavior on shorter sequences seen during training. Our
bounds give qualitative estimates for the length of training data required for
a transformer to generalize, and we verify these insights empirically. These
results sharpen our theoretical understanding of the mechanisms underlying
extrapolation in transformers, and formalize the intuition that richer training
data is required for generalization on more complex tasks.

TL;DR: RLVR在数学推理任务中虽能提升评估指标，但常依赖表面启发式而非真正推理策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究RLVR在数学推理任务中的真实能力，验证其是否能促进真正的推理。

Method: 在Activity Scheduling和Longest Increasing Subsequence两个组合问题上应用RLVR，使用精心设计的数据集和多种奖励方案。

Result: RLVR改善了评估指标，但多通过强化表面启发式而非学习新推理策略。

Conclusion: RLVR的泛化能力有限，需设计能区分真正推理与捷径利用的基准测试。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning is a central challenge for large language models
(LLMs), requiring not only correct answers but also faithful reasoning
processes. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as
a promising approach for enhancing such capabilities; however, its ability to
foster genuine reasoning remains unclear. We investigate RLVR on two
combinatorial problems with fully verifiable solutions: \emph{Activity
Scheduling} and the \emph{Longest Increasing Subsequence}, using carefully
curated datasets with unique optima. Across multiple reward designs, we find
that RLVR improves evaluation metrics but often by reinforcing superficial
heuristics rather than acquiring new reasoning strategies. These findings
highlight the limits of RLVR generalization, emphasizing the importance of
benchmarks that disentangle genuine mathematical reasoning from shortcut
exploitation and provide faithful measures of progress. Code available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文探讨了通过一致性训练减少LLM对无关提示的敏感性，提出了BCT和ACT两种方法，有效降低了模型的附和性和越狱风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在面对提示的微小变化时，可能会妥协其事实性和拒绝能力，导致附和用户或满足不当请求。

Method: 提出了两种一致性训练方法：BCT（基于外部输出）和ACT（基于内部激活），通过自我监督使模型对无关提示保持不变。

Result: BCT和ACT均能有效减少模型的附和性，BCT在减少越狱风险上表现更优。

Conclusion: 一致性训练可以避免依赖静态数据集的问题，部分对齐问题应视为一致性问题而非最优响应问题。

Abstract: An LLM's factuality and refusal training can be compromised by simple changes
to a prompt. Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy
inappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking). We
explore \emph{consistency training}, a self-supervised paradigm that teaches a
model to be invariant to certain irrelevant cues in the prompt. Instead of
teaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim
to teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like
adding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance
in two ways: over the model's external outputs (\emph{Bias-augmented
Consistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al. [2025]) and over its internal
activations (\emph{Activation Consistency Training} (ACT), a method we
introduce). Both methods reduce Gemini 2.5 Flash's susceptibility to irrelevant
cues. Because consistency training uses responses from the model itself as
training data, it avoids issues that arise from stale training data, such as
degrading model capabilities or enforcing outdated response guidelines. While
BCT and ACT reduce sycophancy equally well, BCT does better at jailbreak
reduction. We think that BCT can simplify training pipelines by removing
reliance on static datasets. We argue that some alignment problems are better
viewed not in terms of optimal responses, but rather as consistency issues.

Motivation: 解决算法相似性评估的模糊性和不一致性问题，为克隆检测和程序合成等应用提供实用工具。

Method: 引入EMOC框架，将算法实现嵌入特征空间，并使用PACD数据集进行验证。

Result: EMOC特征支持算法类型聚类、近重复检测和LLM生成程序的多样性量化。

Conclusion: EMOC框架为算法相似性研究提供了实用工具，并开源了代码和数据以促进未来工作。

Abstract: Given two algorithms for the same problem, can we determine whether they are
meaningfully different? In full generality, the question is uncomputable, and
empirically it is muddied by competing notions of similarity. Yet, in many
applications (such as clone detection or program synthesis) a pragmatic and
consistent similarity metric is necessary. We review existing equivalence and
similarity notions and introduce EMOC: An
Evaluation-Memory-Operations-Complexity framework that embeds algorithm
implementations into a feature space suitable for downstream tasks. We compile
PACD, a curated dataset of verified Python implementations across three
problems, and show that EMOC features support clustering and classification of
algorithm types, detection of near-duplicates, and quantification of diversity
in LLM-generated programs. Code, data, and utilities for computing EMOC
embeddings are released to facilitate reproducibility and future work on
algorithm similarity.

automotive systems. Developed through a collaborative partnership between
MLCommons and the Autonomous Vehicle Computing Consortium, this benchmark
addresses the need for standardized performance evaluation methodologies in

including safety and real-time processing that distinguish them from the
domains that previously introduced benchmarks target. Our benchmarking
framework provides latency and accuracy metrics along with evaluation protocols
that enable consistent and reproducible performance comparisons across
different hardware platforms and software implementations. The first iteration
of the benchmark consists of automotive perception tasks in 2D object
detection, 2D semantic segmentation, and 3D object detection. We describe the
methodology behind the benchmark design including the task selection, reference

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自训练在LLM推理中表现出色，但其改进机制尚不明确，研究旨在揭示其动态特性。

Method: 通过分析参数更新稀疏性、标记分布的熵动态以及替代奖励函数，比较自训练与RLVR和SFT。

Result: 研究发现自训练的独特动态特性，并揭示了其在数学推理中的局限性。

Conclusion: 研究为未来通过自训练改进LLM数学推理提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) reasoning, led by reinforcement
learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), have inspired self-play post-training,
where models improve by generating and solving their own problems. While
self-play has shown strong in-domain and out-of-domain gains, the mechanisms
behind these improvements remain poorly understood. In this work, we analyze
the training dynamics of self-play through the lens of the Absolute Zero
Reasoner, comparing it against RLVR and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Our study
examines parameter update sparsity, entropy dynamics of token distributions,
and alternative proposer reward functions. We further connect these dynamics to
reasoning performance using pass@k evaluations. Together, our findings clarify
how self-play differs from other post-training strategies, highlight its
inherent limitations, and point toward future directions for improving LLM math
reasoning through self-play.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的表示学习框架，用于跨被试颅内记录的功能性聚合，解决了电极位置和区域差异的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于电极数量、位置和覆盖区域差异大，跨被试颅内记录的聚合具有挑战性。现有方法（如MNI坐标）难以捕捉真实的功能相似性。

Method: 使用Siamese编码器和对比目标学习电极的功能性标识，并通过transformer建模区域间关系。

Result: 学习的功能空间支持准确的被试内区分和区域一致性聚类，并能零样本迁移到未见通道。

Conclusion: 该框架为缺乏严格任务结构和统一传感器布局的颅内神经数据提供了跨被试聚合和预训练的路径。

Abstract: Aggregating intracranial recordings across subjects is challenging since
electrode count, placement, and covered regions vary widely. Spatial
normalization methods like MNI coordinates offer a shared anatomical reference,
but often fail to capture true functional similarity, particularly when
localization is imprecise; even at matched anatomical coordinates, the targeted
brain region and underlying neural dynamics can differ substantially between
individuals. We propose a scalable representation-learning framework that (i)
learns a subject-agnostic functional identity for each electrode from
multi-region local field potentials using a Siamese encoder with contrastive
objectives, inducing an embedding geometry that is locality-sensitive to
region-specific neural signatures, and (ii) tokenizes these embeddings for a
transformer that models inter-regional relationships with a variable number of
channels. We evaluate this framework on a 20-subject dataset spanning basal
ganglia-thalamic regions collected during flexible rest/movement recording
sessions with heterogeneous electrode layouts. The learned functional space
supports accurate within-subject discrimination and forms clear,
region-consistent clusters; it transfers zero-shot to unseen channels. The
transformer, operating on functional tokens without subject-specific heads or
supervision, captures cross-region dependencies and enables reconstruction of
masked channels, providing a subject-agnostic backbone for downstream decoding.
Together, these results indicate a path toward large-scale, cross-subject
aggregation and pretraining for intracranial neural data where strict task
structure and uniform sensor placement are unavailable.

Motivation: 现有量子启发的融合模型仅依赖酉变换生成纠缠，存在训练不稳定和泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 将多模态编码为量子纯态，通过可微分的量子跳跃操作生成纠缠表示，并联合学习哈密顿量和Lindblad算子。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上表现优于现有模型，并通过冯·诺依曼纠缠熵增强了可解释性。

Conclusion: 为多模态融合提供了理论框架，推动了量子启发方法在复杂跨模态相关性建模中的应用。

Abstract: Quantum theory provides non-classical principles, such as superposition and
entanglement, that inspires promising paradigms in machine learning. However,
most existing quantum-inspired fusion models rely solely on unitary or
unitary-like transformations to generate quantum entanglement. While
theoretically expressive, such approaches often suffer from training
instability and limited generalizability. In this work, we propose a
Quantum-inspired Neural Network with Quantum Jump (QiNN-QJ) for multimodal
entanglement modelling. Each modality is firstly encoded as a quantum pure
state, after which a differentiable module simulating the QJ operator
transforms the separable product state into the entangled representation. By
jointly learning Hamiltonian and Lindblad operators, QiNN-QJ generates
controllable cross-modal entanglement among modalities with dissipative
dynamics, where structured stochasticity and steady-state attractor properties
serve to stabilize training and constrain entanglement shaping. The resulting
entangled states are projected onto trainable measurement vectors to produce
predictions. In addition to achieving superior performance over the
state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI,
and CH-SIMS, QiNN-QJ facilitates enhanced post-hoc interpretability through
von-Neumann entanglement entropy. This work establishes a principled framework
for entangled multimodal fusion and paves the way for quantum-inspired
approaches in modelling complex cross-modal correlations.

Abstract: Bulk tissue RNA sequencing of heterogeneous samples provides averaged gene
expression profiles, obscuring cell type-specific dynamics. To address this, we
present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk
RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions,
leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human
endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by
dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework
provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene
expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure,
priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with
simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic
shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual
phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated
with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells
during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that
our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally,
we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical
implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions,
including integration of spatial transcriptomics.

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，方法有效减少了奖励差异，同时保持了整体性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在保证公平性的同时，维持了策略的竞争力。

Abstract: Offline contextual bandits allow one to learn policies from
historical/offline data without requiring online interaction. However, offline
policy optimization that maximizes overall expected rewards can unintentionally
amplify the reward disparities across groups. As a result, some groups might
benefit more than others from the learned policy, raising concerns about
fairness, especially when the resources are limited. In this paper, we study a
group-sensitive fairness constraint in offline contextual bandits, reducing
group-wise reward disparities that may arise during policy learning. We tackle
the following common-parity requirements: the reward disparity is constrained
within some user-defined threshold or the reward disparity should be minimized
during policy optimization. We propose a constrained offline policy
optimization framework by introducing group-wise reward disparity constraints
into an off-policy gradient-based optimization procedure. To improve the
estimation of the group-wise reward disparity during training, we employ a
doubly robust estimator and further provide a convergence guarantee for policy
optimization. Empirical results in synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate that our method effectively reduces reward disparities while
maintaining competitive overall performance.

Method: 使用2012年Kaggle ASAP数据中的Prompt 6文章，比较基于文章和基于rationales的评分方法，并尝试集成模型。

Result: 基于文章的评分QWK更高，但基于rationales的评分在少数类上F1分数更高。集成模型（文章+rationales）取得了最佳QWK（0.870）。

Conclusion: 集成基于文章和rationales的评分方法可以显著提升自动评分的准确性。

Abstract: This study explored the utilities of rationales generated by GPT-4.1 and
GPT-5 in automated scoring using Prompt 6 essays from the 2012 Kaggle ASAP
data. Essay-based scoring was compared with rationale-based scoring. The study
found in general essay-based scoring performed better than rationale-based
scoring with higher Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK). However, rationale-based
scoring led to higher scoring accuracy in terms of F1 scores for score 0 which
had less representation due to class imbalance issues. The ensemble modeling of
essay-based scoring models increased the scoring accuracy at both specific
score levels and across all score levels. The ensemble modeling of essay-based
scoring and each of the rationale-based scoring performed about the same.
Further ensemble of essay-based scoring and both rationale-based scoring
yielded the best scoring accuracy with QWK of 0.870 compared with 0.848
reported in literature.

Result: 在实验数据集上，FairAD比现有方法快40倍，同时实现公平聚类。

Conclusion: FairAD是一种高效且公平的图聚类方法，适用于大规模图。

Abstract: Due to the growing concern about unsavory behaviors of machine learning
models toward certain demographic groups, the notion of 'fairness' has recently
drawn much attention from the community, thereby motivating the study of
fairness in graph clustering. Fair graph clustering aims to partition the set
of nodes in a graph into $k$ disjoint clusters such that the proportion of each
protected group within each cluster is consistent with the proportion of that
group in the entire dataset. It is, however, computationally challenging to
incorporate fairness constraints into existing graph clustering algorithms,
particularly for large graphs. To address this problem, we propose FairAD, a
computationally efficient fair graph clustering method. It first constructs a
new affinity matrix based on the notion of algebraic distance such that
fairness constraints are imposed. A graph coarsening process is then performed
on this affinity matrix to find representative nodes that correspond to $k$
clusters. Finally, a constrained minimization problem is solved to obtain the
solution of fair clustering. Experiment results on the modified stochastic
block model and six public datasets show that FairAD can achieve fair
clustering while being up to 40 times faster compared to state-of-the-art fair
graph clustering algorithms.

adapting to diverse workloads and maximizing throughput while minimizing
latency. Recent research has focused on automated configuration optimization
using machine learning; however, existing approaches still exhibit several key
limitations. Most tuning frameworks disregard the dependencies among
parameters, assuming that each operates independently. This simplification
prevents optimizers from leveraging relational effects across parameters,
limiting their capacity to capture performancesensitive interactions. Moreover,
to reduce the complexity of the high-dimensional search space, prior work often
selects only the top few parameters for optimization, overlooking others that
contribute meaningfully to performance. Bayesian Optimization (BO), the most
common method for automatic tuning, is also constrained by its reliance on
surrogate models, which can lead to unstable predictions and inefficient
exploration. To overcome these limitations, we propose RelTune, a novel
framework that represents parameter dependencies as a Relational Graph and
learns GNN-based latent embeddings that encode performancerelevant semantics.
RelTune further introduces Hybrid-Score-Guided Bayesian Optimization (HBO),
which combines surrogate predictions with an Affinity Score measuring proximity
to previously high-performing configurations. Experimental results on multiple
DBMSs and workloads demonstrate that RelTune achieves faster convergence and
higher optimization efficiency than conventional BO-based methods, achieving
state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated scenarios.

*Tong Zhao,Jiacheng Li,Yuanchang Zhou,Guangming Tan,Weile Jia*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为“E”的适配器，用于梯度优化器，帮助在达到局部最小值后继续探索，以寻找更低且更平坦的局部最小值，从而提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器在达到局部最小值后停止搜索，但复杂损失几何特性使得这些点未必是最优或泛化最好的。

Method: 通过适配器“E”使优化器在损失低谷区域继续探索，寻找更优局部最小值。

Result: 在大型批量训练任务中，改进后的优化器ALTO平均提升测试准确率2.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法为优化算法设计开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Finding lower and better-generalizing minima is crucial for deep learning.
However, most existing optimizers stop searching the parameter space once they
reach a local minimum. Given the complex geometric properties of the loss
landscape, it is difficult to guarantee that such a point is the lowest or
provides the best generalization. To address this, we propose an adaptor "E"
for gradient-based optimizers. The adapted optimizer tends to continue
exploring along landscape valleys (areas with low and nearly identical losses)
in order to search for potentially better local minima even after reaching a
local minimum. This approach increases the likelihood of finding a lower and
flatter local minimum, which is often associated with better generalization. We
also provide a proof of convergence for the adapted optimizers in both convex
and non-convex scenarios for completeness. Finally, we demonstrate their
effectiveness in an important but notoriously difficult training scenario,
large-batch training, where Lamb is the benchmark optimizer. Our testing
results show that the adapted Lamb, ALTO, increases the test accuracy
(generalization) of the current state-of-the-art optimizer by an average of
2.5% across a variety of large-batch training tasks. This work potentially
opens a new research direction in the design of optimization algorithms.

*Zixuan Hu,Li Shen,Zhenyi Wang,Yongxian Wei,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需攻击模拟的自适应防御策略BDS，通过贝叶斯推理学习数据点的安全属性，有效防御有害微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御策略依赖攻击模拟，无法应对未知攻击和复杂攻击场景，亟需自适应解决方案。

Method: BDS将有害微调防御建模为贝叶斯推理问题，学习数据点的安全属性后验分布，并通过加权约束微调过程。

Result: 在多样化攻击和防御场景中，BDS表现出最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BDS通过自适应贝叶斯方法，显著提升了防御有害微调的能力，且无需攻击模拟。

Abstract: Harmful fine-tuning poses critical safety risks to fine-tuning-as-a-service
for large language models. Existing defense strategies preemptively build
robustness via attack simulation but suffer from fundamental limitations: (i)
the infeasibility of extending attack simulations beyond bounded threat models
due to the inherent difficulty of anticipating unknown attacks, and (ii)
limited adaptability to varying attack settings, as simulation fails to capture
their variability and complexity. To address these challenges, we propose
Bayesian Data Scheduler (BDS), an adaptive tuning-stage defense strategy with
no need for attack simulation. BDS formulates harmful fine-tuning defense as a
Bayesian inference problem, learning the posterior distribution of each data
point's safety attribute, conditioned on the fine-tuning and alignment
datasets. The fine-tuning process is then constrained by weighting data with
their safety attributes sampled from the posterior, thus mitigating the
influence of harmful data. By leveraging the post hoc nature of Bayesian
inference, the posterior is conditioned on the fine-tuning dataset, enabling
BDS to tailor its defense to the specific dataset, thereby achieving adaptive
defense. Furthermore, we introduce a neural scheduler based on amortized
Bayesian learning, enabling efficient transfer to new data without retraining.
Comprehensive results across diverse attack and defense settings demonstrate
the state-of-the-art performance of our approach. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的多项式时间算法，显著改进了在线稀疏线性回归（OSLR）问题在兼容性条件下的遗憾边界，并扩展了算法以处理额外观测的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在线稀疏线性回归问题，其中算法每实例只能访问k个属性进行预测，且该问题已被证明是NP难问题。前人工作基于数据矩阵满足线性独立性、兼容性条件或受限等距性假设提出了多项式时间算法。本文旨在在更弱的兼容性条件下改进遗憾边界。

Method: 提出了一种基于Dantzig Selector的新算法，结合了算法依赖的协方差矩阵估计采样方案、自适应参数调整方案和批处理在线牛顿步等新技术。

Result: 显著改进了前人工作（Ito et al., 2017）的遗憾边界，并进一步扩展到支持额外观测的OSLR问题，改进了Kale et al. (2017)和Ito et al. (2017)的遗憾边界。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入新技术和非平凡分析，在兼容性条件下显著提升了OSLR问题的性能，并展示了算法的扩展能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of online sparse linear regression (OSLR)
where the algorithms are restricted to accessing only $k$ out of $d$ attributes
per instance for prediction, which was proved to be NP-hard. Previous work gave
polynomial-time algorithms assuming the data matrix satisfies the linear
independence of features, the compatibility condition, or the restricted
isometry property. We introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm, which
significantly improves previous regret bounds (Ito et al., 2017) under the
compatibility condition that is weaker than the other two assumptions. The
improvements benefit from a tighter convergence rate of the $\ell_1$-norm error
of our estimators. Our algorithm leverages the well-studied Dantzig Selector,
but importantly with several novel techniques, including an algorithm-dependent
sampling scheme for estimating the covariance matrix, an adaptive parameter
tuning scheme, and a batching online Newton step with careful initializations.
We also give novel and non-trivial analyses, including an induction method for
analyzing the $\ell_1$-norm error, careful analyses on the covariance of
non-independent random variables, and a decomposition on the regret. We further
extend our algorithm to OSLR with additional observations where the algorithms
can observe additional $k_0$ attributes after each prediction, and improve
previous regret bounds (Kale et al., 2017; Ito et al., 2017).

TL;DR: SERFLOW通过动态分配FaaS和IaaS资源，优化ML模型分区的卸载，减少云成本23%并适应动态负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视虚拟机冷启动和长尾服务时间分布等现实因素，导致资源利用不足或无法快速扩展。

Method: 将ML查询建模为无环阶段序列，每个阶段包含稀疏模型参数块，根据请求退出率进行阶段特定资源分配。

Result: SERFLOW结合自适应负载均衡，显著降低成本并高效适应动态工作负载。

Conclusion: SERFLOW通过智能资源分配和负载均衡，解决了ML模型分区卸载中的现实挑战。

Abstract: Dynamic offloading of Machine Learning (ML) model partitions across different
resource orchestration services, such as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) and
Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), can balance processing and transmission
delays while minimizing costs of adaptive inference applications. However,
prior work often overlooks real-world factors, such as Virtual Machine (VM)
cold starts, requests under long-tail service time distributions, etc. To
tackle these limitations, we model each ML query (request) as traversing an
acyclic sequence of stages, wherein each stage constitutes a contiguous block
of sparse model parameters ending in an internal or final classifier where
requests may exit. Since input-dependent exit rates vary, no single resource
configuration suits all query distributions. IaaS-based VMs become
underutilized when many requests exit early, yet rapidly scaling to handle
request bursts reaching deep layers is impractical. SERFLOW addresses this
challenge by leveraging FaaS-based serverless functions (containers) and using
stage-specific resource provisioning that accounts for the fraction of requests
exiting at each stage. By integrating this provisioning with adaptive load
balancing across VMs and serverless functions based on request ingestion,
SERFLOW reduces cloud costs by over $23\%$ while efficiently adapting to
dynamic workloads.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通事故预测模型无法捕捉复杂的空间和时间依赖关系，MDAS-GNN旨在解决这一问题。

Result: 在多个地区数据上表现优异，长期预测效果突出，预测误差降低40%。

Conclusion: MDAS-GNN为城市规划和交通设计提供了先进的预测工具，支持数据驱动的决策。

Abstract: Traffic accidents represent a critical public health challenge, claiming over
1.35 million lives annually worldwide. Traditional accident prediction models
treat road segments independently, failing to capture complex spatial
relationships and temporal dependencies in urban transportation networks. This
study develops MDAS-GNN, a Multi-Dimensional Attention-based Spatial-diffusion
Graph Neural Network integrating three core risk dimensions: traffic safety,
infrastructure, and environmental risk. The framework employs feature-specific
spatial diffusion mechanisms and multi-head temporal attention to capture
dependencies across different time horizons. Evaluated on UK Department for
Transport accident data across Central London, South Manchester, and SE
Birmingham, MDASGNN achieves superior performance compared to established
baseline methods. The model maintains consistently low prediction errors across
short, medium, and long-term periods, with particular strength in long-term
forecasting. Ablation studies confirm that integrated multi-dimensional
features outperform singlefeature approaches, reducing prediction errors by up
to 40%. This framework provides civil engineers and urban planners with
advanced predictive capabilities for transportation infrastructure design,
enabling data-driven decisions for road network optimization, infrastructure
resource improvements, and strategic safety interventions in urban development
projects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流归因方法对非线性特征和交互作用的解释不足，FFCA旨在提供更全面的模型解释。

Method: 提出Feature-Function Curvature Analysis (FFCA)框架，量化特征的四个维度，并扩展为动态原型分析。

Result: 实验证明FFCA能揭示模型学习的层次性，并提供诊断工具预测过拟合。

Conclusion: FFCA通过静态和动态分析，提供了更全面、可信的模型解释方法。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is critical for building trust in complex machine
learning models, yet mainstream attribution methods often provide an
incomplete, static picture of a model's final state. By collapsing a feature's
role into a single score, they are confounded by non-linearity and
interactions. To address this, we introduce Feature-Function Curvature Analysis
(FFCA), a novel framework that analyzes the geometry of a model's learned
function. FFCA produces a 4-dimensional signature for each feature, quantifying
its: (1) Impact, (2) Volatility, (3) Non-linearity, and (4) Interaction.
Crucially, we extend this framework into Dynamic Archetype Analysis, which
tracks the evolution of these signatures throughout the training process. This
temporal view moves beyond explaining what a model learned to revealing how it
learns. We provide the first direct, empirical evidence of hierarchical
learning, showing that models consistently learn simple linear effects before
complex interactions. Furthermore, this dynamic analysis provides novel,
practical diagnostics for identifying insufficient model capacity and
predicting the onset of overfitting. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that FFCA, through its static and dynamic components, provides the essential
geometric context that transforms model explanation from simple quantification
to a nuanced, trustworthy analysis of the entire learning process.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为STAR的路由策略，用于减少不变和等变表示学习中的冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过独立投影头学习不变和等变表示，忽略了二者之间的共享信息，导致特征冗余和模型容量浪费。

Method: 引入Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR)策略，将投影头建模为专家，分别捕获共享或任务特定信息。

Result: 实验显示，STAR降低了不变和等变嵌入之间的典型相关性，并在多种迁移学习任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: STAR通过有效利用共享信息，提升了表示学习的效率，适用于多种下游任务。

Abstract: Equivariant representation learning aims to capture variations induced by
input transformations in the representation space, whereas invariant
representation learning encodes semantic information by disregarding such
transformations. Recent studies have shown that jointly learning both types of
representations is often beneficial for downstream tasks, typically by
employing separate projection heads. However, this design overlooks information
shared between invariant and equivariant learning, which leads to redundant
feature learning and inefficient use of model capacity. To address this, we
introduce Soft Task-Aware Routing (STAR), a routing strategy for projection
heads that models them as experts. STAR induces the experts to specialize in
capturing either shared or task-specific information, thereby reducing
redundant feature learning. We validate this effect by observing lower
canonical correlations between invariant and equivariant embeddings.
Experimental results show consistent improvements across diverse transfer
learning tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/star.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）在非独立同分布和长尾数据分布下会导致全局模型偏差，影响模型性能。

Method: FedSM利用预训练的图文对齐模型计算类别级语义相关性，指导本地特征与全局原型混合生成类别一致的伪特征，并通过概率类别选择增强特征多样性。

Result: 在多种不平衡水平的长尾数据集上，FedSM在准确性上优于现有方法，且对领域偏移具有高鲁棒性和计算效率。

Conclusion: FedSM通过语义引导的特征混合和轻量级分类器重训练，有效解决了联邦学习中的全局模型偏差问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
decentralized clients without sharing private data. However, FL suffers from
biased global models due to non-IID and long-tail data distributions. We
propose \textbf{FedSM}, a novel client-centric framework that mitigates this
bias through semantics-guided feature mixup and lightweight classifier
retraining. FedSM uses a pretrained image-text-aligned model to compute
category-level semantic relevance, guiding the category selection of local
features to mix-up with global prototypes to generate class-consistent
pseudo-features. These features correct classifier bias, especially when data
are heavily skewed. To address the concern of potential domain shift between
the pretrained model and the data, we propose probabilistic category selection,
enhancing feature diversity to effectively mitigate biases. All computations
are performed locally, requiring minimal server overhead. Extensive experiments
on long-tail datasets with various imbalanced levels demonstrate that FedSM
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, with high
robustness to domain shift and computational efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集中存在冗余或有害实例，传统方法未考虑数据质量，影响蒸馏效果。

Method: 提出IWD框架，基于影响函数自适应加权实例，优先有益数据。

Result: 实验显示IWD提升蒸馏数据集质量，模型准确率最高提升7.8%。

Conclusion: IWD通过数据质量加权，有效提升数据集蒸馏效果。

Abstract: Dataset distillation condenses large datasets into synthetic subsets,
achieving performance comparable to training on the full dataset while
substantially reducing storage and computation costs. Most existing dataset
distillation methods assume that all real instances contribute equally to the
process. In practice, real-world datasets contain both informative and
redundant or even harmful instances, and directly distilling the full dataset
without considering data quality can degrade model performance. In this work,
we present Influence-Weighted Distillation IWD, a principled framework that
leverages influence functions to explicitly account for data quality in the
distillation process. IWD assigns adaptive weights to each instance based on
its estimated impact on the distillation objective, prioritizing beneficial
data while downweighting less useful or harmful ones. Owing to its modular
design, IWD can be seamlessly integrated into diverse dataset distillation
frameworks. Our empirical results suggest that integrating IWD tends to improve
the quality of distilled datasets and enhance model performance, with accuracy
gains of up to 7.8%.

Method: 提出ECVL-ROUTER框架，引入新的路由策略和评估指标，动态选择模型，并构建多模态响应质量数据集用于训练。

Result: 实验表明，80%以上的查询被路由到小模型，问题解决概率下降不到10%。

Conclusion: ECVL-ROUTER有效平衡了模型性能和资源消耗，适用于多样化场景。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in diverse multimodal tasks. However,
user requirements vary across scenarios, which can be categorized into fast
response, high-quality output, and low energy consumption. Relying solely on
large models deployed in the cloud for all queries often leads to high latency
and energy cost, while small models deployed on edge devices are capable of
handling simpler tasks with low latency and energy cost. To fully leverage the
strengths of both large and small models, we propose ECVL-ROUTER, the first
scenario-aware routing framework for VLMs. Our approach introduces a new
routing strategy and evaluation metrics that dynamically select the appropriate
model for each query based on user requirements, maximizing overall utility. We
also construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router
training and validate the approach through extensive experiments. Results show
that our approach successfully routes over 80\% of queries to the small model
while incurring less than 10\% drop in problem solving probability.

Method: 提出HLA机制，利用紧凑前缀统计实现高阶交互，支持线性时间计算和严格因果性，并提供并行训练方案。

Result: HLA在保持恒定状态大小的同时实现线性时间计算，无需生成大型矩阵，且支持高阶扩展。

Conclusion: HLA是一种高效、可扩展的注意力机制，结合了数据依赖混合和现代循环架构的效率。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of scaled dot-product attention is a central obstacle to
scaling autoregressive language models to long contexts. Linear-time attention
and State Space Models (SSMs) provide scalable alternatives but are typically
restricted to first-order or kernel-based approximations, which can limit
expressivity. We introduce Higher-order Linear Attention (HLA), a causal,
streaming mechanism that realizes higher interactions via compact prefix
sufficient statistics. In the second-order case, HLA maintains a constant-size
state and computes per-token outputs in linear time without materializing any
$n \times n$ matrices. We give closed-form streaming identities, a strictly
causal masked variant using two additional summaries, and a chunk-parallel
training scheme based on associative scans that reproduces the activations of a
serial recurrence exactly. We further outline extensions to third and higher
orders. Collectively, these results position HLA as a principled, scalable
building block that combines attention-like, data-dependent mixing with the
efficiency of modern recurrent architectures. Project Page:

Conclusion: ODP-Bench为未来研究提供了便利和公平的比较标准，同时帮助理解算法的局限性。

Abstract: Recently, there has been gradually more attention paid to Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) performance prediction, whose goal is to predict the performance of
trained models on unlabeled OOD test datasets, so that we could better leverage
and deploy off-the-shelf trained models in risk-sensitive scenarios. Although
progress has been made in this area, evaluation protocols in previous
literature are inconsistent, and most works cover only a limited number of
real-world OOD datasets and types of distribution shifts. To provide convenient
and fair comparisons for various algorithms, we propose Out-of-Distribution
Performance Prediction Benchmark (ODP-Bench), a comprehensive benchmark that
includes most commonly used OOD datasets and existing practical performance
prediction algorithms. We provide our trained models as a testbench for future
researchers, thus guaranteeing the consistency of comparison and avoiding the
burden of repeating the model training process. Furthermore, we also conduct
in-depth experimental analyses to better understand their capability boundary.

Conclusion: HiF-DTA通过全局-局部特征提取和多尺度建模显著提升了药物-靶标亲和力预测的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of Drug-Target Affinity (DTA) is crucial for reducing
experimental costs and accelerating early screening in computational drug
discovery. While sequence-based deep learning methods avoid reliance on costly
3D structures, they still overlook simultaneous modeling of global sequence
semantic features and local topological structural features within drugs and
proteins, and represent drugs as flat sequences without atomic-level,
substructural-level, and molecular-level multi-scale features. We propose
HiF-DTA, a hierarchical network that adopts a dual-pathway strategy to extract
both global sequence semantic and local topological features from drug and
protein sequences, and models drugs multi-scale to learn atomic, substructural,
and molecular representations fused via a multi-scale bilinear attention
module. Experiments on Davis, KIBA, and Metz datasets show HiF-DTA outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, with ablations confirming the importance of
global-local extraction and multi-scale fusion.

multiple sources and governed by sophisticated access controls. We present
EnterpriseBench, a comprehensive benchmark that simulates enterprise settings,
featuring 500 diverse tasks across software engineering, HR, finance, and

characteristics including data source fragmentation, access control
hierarchies, and cross-functional workflows. Additionally, we provide a novel
data generation pipeline that creates internally consistent enterprise tasks
from organizational metadata. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLM agents
demonstrate that even the most capable models achieve only 41.8% task
completion, highlighting significant opportunities for improvement in
enterprise-focused AI systems.

Abstract: The oscillations of the human heart rate are inherently complex and
non-linear -- they are best described by mathematical chaos, and they present a
challenge when applied to the practical domain of cardiovascular health
monitoring in everyday life. In this work, we study the non-linear chaotic
behavior of heart rate through mutual information and introduce a novel
approach for enhancing heart rate estimation in real-life conditions. Our
proposed approach not only explains and handles the non-linear temporal
complexity from a mathematical perspective but also improves the deep learning
solutions when combined with them. We validate our proposed method on four
established datasets from real-life scenarios and compare its performance with
existing algorithms thoroughly with extensive ablation experiments. Our results
demonstrate a substantial improvement, up to 40\%, of the proposed approach in
estimating heart rate compared to traditional methods and existing
machine-learning techniques while reducing the reliance on multiple sensing
modalities and eliminating the need for post-processing steps.

Abstract: With the growing volume of Internet of Things (IoT) network traffic, machine
learning (ML)-based anomaly detection is more relevant than ever. Traditional
batch learning models face challenges such as high maintenance and poor
adaptability to rapid anomaly changes, known as concept drift. In contrast,
streaming learning integrates online and incremental learning, enabling
seamless updates and concept drift detection to improve robustness. This study
investigates anomaly detection in streaming IoT traffic as binary
classification, comparing batch and streaming learning approaches while
assessing the limitations of current IoT traffic datasets. We simulated
heterogeneous network data streams by carefully mixing existing datasets and
streaming the samples one by one. Our results highlight the failure of batch
models to handle concept drift, but also reveal persisting limitations of
current datasets to expose model limitations due to low traffic heterogeneity.
We also investigated the competitiveness of tree-based ML algorithms,
well-known in batch anomaly detection, and compared it to non-tree-based ones,
confirming the advantages of the former. Adaptive Random Forest achieved
F1-score of 0.990 $\pm$ 0.006 at one-third the computational cost of its batch
counterpart. Hoeffding Adaptive Tree reached F1-score of 0.910 $\pm$ 0.007,
reducing computational cost by four times, making it a viable choice for online
applications despite a slight trade-off in stability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种衡量语言模型输出新颖性的方法，通过不可归因性来定义语义新颖性，并验证了模型在预训练数据上的依赖程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究语言模型输出与预训练语料之间的关系，尤其是哪些输出无法归因于任何预训练数据，以衡量语义新颖性。

Method: 采用两阶段检索流程：先用轻量级GIST嵌入索引语料，检索候选，再用ColBERTv2重新排序，判断输出是否新颖。

Result: 发现模型依赖预训练数据的跨度更长，某些领域会系统性影响新颖性，指令微调不仅改变风格还增加新颖性。

Conclusion: 通过不可归因性重新定义新颖性评估，支持大规模分析，并公开了语料和索引工具以促进研究。

Abstract: Understanding how language-model outputs relate to the pretraining corpus is
central to studying model behavior. Most training data attribution (TDA)
methods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often
using leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be
attributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an
operational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining
corpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a
simple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST
embeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the
nearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,
we consider the output of the model as novel. We evaluate on SmolLM and SmolLM2
and report three findings: (1) models draw on pretraining data across much
longer spans than previously reported; (2) some domains systematically promote
or suppress novelty; and (3) instruction tuning not only alters style but also
increases novelty. Reframing novelty assessment around un-attributability
enables efficient analysis at pretraining scale. We release ~20 TB of corpus
chunks and index artifacts to support replication and large-scale extension of
our analysis at https://huggingface.co/datasets/stai-tuebingen/faiss-smollm

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗数据的多模态和异质性时间结构对建模提出了挑战，需要一种能够灵活处理这些复杂性的方法。

Method: MedM2T结合了稀疏时间序列编码器、分层时间感知融合和双模态注意力机制，并使用预训练编码器和共享编码器对齐特征。

Abstract: The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical
data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware
multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates:
(i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time
series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and
macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and
(iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be
extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between
modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns
resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and
MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease
dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality
prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed
state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series
models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction;
an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the
robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising
tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at

TL;DR: 研究发现，基于结果强化学习的语言模型在推理过程中生成的思维链（CoT）往往不清晰，影响监控效果，但最终答案仍可读。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索强化学习训练的模型在推理过程中思维链的清晰度及其对监控的影响。

Method: 分析了14个推理模型的思维链清晰度，测试了强制使用清晰部分时的准确性。

Result: RL常导致思维链不清晰，但最终答案可读；强制使用清晰部分时准确性下降53%。

Conclusion: 若不明确优化清晰度，强化学习会生成推理过程不透明的模型，可能削弱监控效果。

Abstract: Language models trained via outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) to
reason using chain-of-thought (CoT) have shown remarkable performance.
Monitoring such a model's CoT may allow us to understand its intentions and
detect potential malicious behavior. However, to be effective, this requires
that CoTs are legible and faithful. We study CoT legibility across 14 reasoning
models, finding that RL often causes reasoning to become illegible to both
humans and AI monitors, with reasoning models (except Claude) generating
illegible CoTs while returning to perfectly readable final answers. We show
that models use illegible reasoning to reach correct answers (accuracy dropping
by 53\% when forced to use only legible portions), yet find no correlation
between legibility and performance when resampling - suggesting the
relationship is more nuanced. We also find that legibility degrades on harder
questions. We discuss potential hypotheses for these results, including
steganography, training artifacts, and vestigial tokens. These results suggest
that without explicit optimization for legibility, outcome-based RL naturally
produces models with increasingly opaque reasoning processes, potentially
undermining monitoring approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探讨如何通过链式思维（CoT）输出的透明度和完整性来监控模型的不安全或未对齐行为。

Method: 方法是通过引入详尽性（verbosity）概念，结合忠实性（faithfulness），形成一个综合的监控性评分。

Result: 结果显示，不同模型家族的监控性差异显著，且模型可能在表面上忠实但缺乏关键推理因素的透明度。

Conclusion: 结论是监控性评分能有效评估模型推理的外部工作记忆功能，并支持未来可复现的研究。

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) outputs let us read a model's step-by-step reasoning.
Since any long, serial reasoning process must pass through this textual trace,
the quality of the CoT is a direct window into what the model is thinking. This
visibility could help us spot unsafe or misaligned behavior (monitorability),
but only if the CoT is transparent about its internal reasoning (faithfulness).
Fully measuring faithfulness is difficult, so researchers often focus on
examining the CoT in cases where the model changes its answer after adding a
cue to the input. This proxy finds some instances of unfaithfulness but loses
information when the model maintains its answer, and does not investigate
aspects of reasoning not tied to the cue. We extend these results to a more
holistic sense of monitorability by introducing verbosity: whether the CoT
lists every factor needed to solve the task. We combine faithfulness and
verbosity into a single monitorability score that shows how well the CoT serves
as the model's external `working memory', a property that many safety schemes
based on CoT monitoring depend on. We evaluate instruction-tuned and reasoning
models on BBH, GPQA, and MMLU. Our results show that models can appear faithful
yet remain hard to monitor when they leave out key factors, and that
monitorability differs sharply across model families. We release our evaluation
code using the Inspect library to support reproducible future work.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在本地更新时忽略了权重矩阵的几何结构，导致条件数恶化且收敛缓慢。

Method: 引入Muon优化器进行矩阵正交化，并提出FedMuon优化器，结合动量聚合和局部-全局对齐技术。

Result: FedMuon在理论和实验上均表现出色，显著减少通信轮次并提高测试精度。

Conclusion: FedMuon是一种高效的联邦学习优化器，适用于异构和非异构场景。

Abstract: The core bottleneck of Federated Learning (FL) lies in the communication
rounds. That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for
reducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use
element-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of
the weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological
directions in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the
condition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon
optimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize
matrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,
Local Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces
communication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID
setting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions
of each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses
significant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)
moment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
Federated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)
momentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local
initialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are
aligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.
Theoretically, we prove that \texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup
convergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number
of participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and
$R$ is the total number of communication rounds. Empirically, we validate the
effectiveness of FedMuon on language and vision models. Compared to several
baselines, FedMuon significantly reduces communication rounds and improves test
accuracy.

Motivation: 现有可解释性方法成本高且难以扩展，需要模型特定的稀疏自编码器训练和手动标注。

Result: 实现了语义特征搜索、检索和可解释生成，无需标注数据。

Conclusion: Atlas-Alignment通过一次性高质量Concept Atlas投资，实现多模型透明化和可控性，降低边际成本。

Abstract: Interpretability is crucial for building safe, reliable, and controllable
language models, yet existing interpretability pipelines remain costly and
difficult to scale. Interpreting a new model typically requires costly training
of model-specific sparse autoencoders, manual or semi-automated labeling of SAE
components, and their subsequent validation. We introduce Atlas-Alignment, a
framework for transferring interpretability across language models by aligning
unknown latent spaces to a Concept Atlas - a labeled, human-interpretable
latent space - using only shared inputs and lightweight representational
alignment techniques. Once aligned, this enables two key capabilities in
previously opaque models: (1) semantic feature search and retrieval, and (2)
steering generation along human-interpretable atlas concepts. Through
quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we show that simple representational
alignment methods enable robust semantic retrieval and steerable generation
without the need for labeled concept data. Atlas-Alignment thus amortizes the
cost of explainable AI and mechanistic interpretability: by investing in one
high-quality Concept Atlas, we can make many new models transparent and
controllable at minimal marginal cost.

Conclusion: MVeLMA有助于未来灾害救援规划、生态政策制定和野生动物恢复管理。

Abstract: Understanding post-wildfire vegetation loss is critical for developing
effective ecological recovery strategies and is often challenging due to the
extended time and effort required to capture the evolving ecosystem features.
Recent works in this area have not fully explored all the contributing factors,
their modalities, and interactions with each other. Furthermore, most research
in this domain is limited by a lack of interpretability in predictive modeling,
making it less useful in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a novel
end-to-end ML pipeline called MVeLMA (\textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{Ve}getation
\textbf{L}oss \textbf{M}odeling \textbf{A}rchitecture) to predict county-wise
vegetation loss from fire events. MVeLMA uses a multimodal feature integration
pipeline and a stacked ensemble-based architecture to capture different
modalities while also incorporating uncertainty estimation through
probabilistic modeling. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that our
model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) and baseline models in
predicting post-wildfire vegetation loss. Furthermore, we generate vegetation
loss confidence maps to identify high-risk counties, thereby helping targeted
recovery efforts. The findings of this work have the potential to inform future
disaster relief planning, ecological policy development, and wildlife recovery
management.

Result: 在节点级稀疏化任务中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Spectral Preservation Network在性能和计算效率上具有明显优势。

Abstract: Graphs are central to modeling complex systems in domains such as social
networks, molecular chemistry, and neuroscience. While Graph Neural Networks,
particularly Graph Convolutional Networks, have become standard tools for graph
learning, they remain constrained by reliance on fixed structures and
susceptibility to over-smoothing. We propose the Spectral Preservation Network,
a new framework for graph representation learning that generates reduced graphs
serving as faithful proxies of the original, enabling downstream tasks such as
community detection, influence propagation, and information diffusion at a
reduced computational cost. The Spectral Preservation Network introduces two
key components: the Joint Graph Evolution layer and the Spectral Concordance
loss. The former jointly transforms both the graph topology and the node
feature matrix, allowing the structure and attributes to evolve adaptively
across layers and overcoming the rigidity of static neighborhood aggregation.
The latter regularizes these transformations by enforcing consistency in both
the spectral properties of the graph and the feature vectors of the nodes. We
evaluate the effectiveness of Spectral Preservation Network on node-level
sparsification by analyzing well-established metrics and benchmarking against
state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results demonstrate the superior
performance and clear advantages of our approach.

Abstract: We propose a method for learning and sampling from probability distributions
supported on the simplex. Our approach maps the open simplex to Euclidean space
via smooth bijections, leveraging the Aitchison geometry to define the
mappings, and supports modeling categorical data by a Dirichlet interpolation
that dequantizes discrete observations into continuous ones. This enables
density modeling in Euclidean space through the bijection while still allowing
exact recovery of the original discrete distribution. Compared to previous
methods that operate on the simplex using Riemannian geometry or custom noise
processes, our approach works in Euclidean space while respecting the Aitchison
geometry, and achieves competitive performance on both synthetic and real-world
data sets.

Conclusion: 通过分布分析和重采样，可实现可靠的因果分析、清晰的模型推理解释和原则性干预。

Abstract: Most work interpreting reasoning models studies only a single
chain-of-thought (CoT), yet these models define distributions over many
possible CoTs. We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for
understanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully
specifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.
We present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,
when a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause
the action? In "agentic misalignment" scenarios, we resample specific sentences
to measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small
causal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are
artificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in
literature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a
completion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We
find off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to
resampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of
removing a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce
a resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from
reappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have
large effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes "unfaithful", can
our methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation
analysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without
being explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT
that persists even if the hint is removed. Overall, studying distributions via
resampling enables reliable causal analysis, clearer narratives of model
reasoning, and principled CoT interventions.

Motivation: AdamW在联邦学习中直接应用存在高方差、局部过拟合和收敛慢的问题，需要改进。

Result: 理论证明FedAdamW具有线性加速收敛率，实验验证其在语言和视觉Transformer模型中的有效性。

Conclusion: FedAdamW显著减少通信轮次并提高测试准确率，适用于大规模模型训练。

Abstract: AdamW has become one of the most effective optimizers for training
large-scale models. We have also observed its effectiveness in the context of
federated learning (FL). However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning
settings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW
often yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)
the local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing
moment estimates ($\boldsymbol{v}$, $\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down
convergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first
\underline{Fed}erated \underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \texttt{FedAdamW},
for training and fine-tuning various large models. \texttt{FedAdamW} aligns
local updates with the global update using both a \textbf{local correction
mechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.
\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \texttt{mean} of the second-moment
estimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them. Theoretically, we
prove that \texttt{FedAdamW} achieves a linear speedup convergence rate of
$\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(L \Delta \sigma_l^2)/(S K R \epsilon^2)}+(L \Delta)/R)$
without \textbf{heterogeneity assumption}, where $S$ is the number of
participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and $R$
is the total number of communication rounds. We also employ PAC-Bayesian
generalization analysis to explain the effectiveness of decoupled weight decay
in local training. Empirically, we validate the effectiveness of
\texttt{FedAdamW} on language and vision Transformer models. Compared to
several baselines, \texttt{FedAdamW} significantly reduces communication rounds
and improves test accuracy. The code is available in

Motivation: 现有的Transformer模型在文本和图像领域表现优异，但在3D分子生成中仍存在挑战，包括分子标记化和几何建模问题。

Method: InertialAR通过惯性帧对齐和几何旋转位置编码（GeoRoPE）实现SE(3)和排列不变性，并采用分层自回归范式预测原子类型和3D坐标。

Result: 在QM9、GEOM-Drugs和B3LYP数据集上，InertialAR在10项评估指标中7项表现最佳，并在可控生成任务中全面领先。

Conclusion: InertialAR通过创新的标记化和几何建模方法，显著提升了3D分子生成的性能，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models have emerged as a unifying paradigm
across modalities such as text and images, but their extension to 3D molecule
generation remains underexplored. The gap stems from two fundamental
challenges: (1) tokenizing molecules into a canonical 1D sequence of tokens
that is invariant to both SE(3) transformations and atom index permutations,
and (2) designing an architecture capable of modeling hybrid atom-based tokens
that couple discrete atom types with continuous 3D coordinates. To address
these challenges, we introduce InertialAR. InertialAR devises a canonical
tokenization that aligns molecules to their inertial frames and reorders atoms
to ensure SE(3) and permutation invariance. Moreover, InertialAR equips the
attention mechanism with geometric awareness via geometric rotary positional
encoding (GeoRoPE). In addition, it utilizes a hierarchical autoregressive
paradigm to predict the next atom-based token, predicting the atom type first
and then its 3D coordinates via Diffusion loss. Experimentally, InertialAR
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 7 of the 10 evaluation metrics for
unconditional molecule generation across QM9, GEOM-Drugs, and B3LYP. Moreover,
it significantly outperforms strong baselines in controllable generation for
targeted chemical functionality, attaining state-of-the-art results across all

Result: 在视觉和自然语言处理任务中显著优于现有算法，同时提供严格的隐私保证。

Conclusion: DP-FedPGN有效缓解了DP导致的性能下降，消除了数据异质性影响，并实现了快速收敛。

Abstract: To prevent inference attacks in Federated Learning (FL) and reduce the
leakage of sensitive information, Client-level Differentially Private Federated
Learning (CL-DPFL) is widely used. However, current CL-DPFL methods usually
result in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model
generalization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware
Minimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find
a local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local
flatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address
this issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL
algorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to
the local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global
gradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also
reduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error
of gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN
mitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed
DP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves
fast convergence. We also use R\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees
and provide sensitivity analysis for local updates. Finally, we conduct
effectiveness tests on both ResNet and Transformer models, and achieve
significant improvements in six visual and natural language processing tasks
compared to existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The code is available at

Abstract: The conjugate gradient solver (CG) is a prevalent method for solving
symmetric and positive definite linear systems Ax=b, where effective
preconditioners are crucial for fast convergence. Traditional preconditioners
rely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while
limiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing
learning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve
the performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on
incomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated
triangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces
long-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these
issues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly
preconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate
Inverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires
only two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector
product is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The
flexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of
scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce a statistics-based scale-invariant loss
function. Its design matches CG's property that the convergence rate depends on
the condition number, rather than the absolute scale of A, leading to improved
performance of the learned preconditioner. Evaluations on three PDE-derived
datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms
standard preconditioners (Diagonal, IC, and traditional SPAI) and previous
learning-based preconditioners on GPUs. We reduce solution time on GPUs by
40%-53% (68%-113% faster), along with better condition numbers and superior
generalization performance. Source code available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通用时间序列基础模型在EEG任务中的适用性，填补领域空白。

Method: 测试两种预训练方式：多领域真实数据和纯合成数据。

Result: 两种预训练方式均优于EEGNet和CBraMod。

Conclusion: 跨领域预训练模型在EEG分析中具有潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models for time series are emerging as powerful general-purpose
backbones, yet their potential for domain-specific biomedical signals such as
electroencephalography (EEG) remains rather unexplored. In this work, we
investigate the applicability a recently proposed time series classification
foundation model, to a different EEG tasks such as motor imagery classification
and sleep stage prediction. We test two pretraining regimes: (a) pretraining on
heterogeneous real-world time series from multiple domains, and (b) pretraining
on purely synthetic data. We find that both variants yield strong performance,
consistently outperforming EEGNet, a widely used convolutional baseline, and
CBraMod, the most recent EEG-specific foundation model. These results suggest
that generalist time series foundation models, even when pretrained on data of
non-neural origin or on synthetic signals, can transfer effectively to EEG. Our
findings highlight the promise of leveraging cross-domain pretrained models for
brain signal analysis, suggesting that EEG may benefit from advances in the
broader time series literature.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合迁移学习和主动学习的贝叶斯框架，用于结构健康监测（SHM）中的领域适应（DA），以提高标签稀缺场景下的数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结构健康监测（SHM）的训练数据获取成本高且不切实际，尤其是标记数据。基于群体的SHM（PBSHM）试图通过利用多结构数据解决这一问题，但不同结构的数据分布不同，可能导致模型泛化误差大。

Method: 提出了一种贝叶斯框架，用于在PBSHM中进行领域适应（DA），并结合主动采样策略，选择信息量最大的观测数据进行标记。

Result: 在实验桥梁群体上的评估表明，结合迁移学习和主动学习可以提高标签稀缺场景下分类模型的学习效率。

Conclusion: 该方法可以减少结构在其生命周期内的检查次数和运营成本，对数据驱动的结构运维具有重要意义。

Abstract: Data for training structural health monitoring (SHM) systems are often
expensive and/or impractical to obtain, particularly for labelled data.
Population-based SHM (PBSHM) aims to address this limitation by leveraging data
from multiple structures. However, data from different structures will follow
distinct distributions, potentially leading to large generalisation errors for
models learnt via conventional machine learning methods. To address this issue,
transfer learning -- in the form of domain adaptation (DA) -- can be used to
align the data distributions. Most previous approaches have only considered
\emph{unsupervised} DA, where no labelled target data are available; they do
not consider how to incorporate these technologies in an online framework --
updating as labels are obtained throughout the monitoring campaign. This paper
proposes a Bayesian framework for DA in PBSHM, that can improve unsupervised DA
mappings using a limited quantity of labelled target data. In addition, this
model is integrated into an active sampling strategy to guide inspections to
select the most informative observations to label -- leading to further
reductions in the required labelled data to learn a target classifier. The
effectiveness of this methodology is evaluated on a population of experimental
bridges. Specifically, this population includes data corresponding to several
damage states, as well as, a comprehensive set of environmental conditions. It
is found that combining transfer learning and active learning can improve data
efficiency when learning classification models in label-scarce scenarios. This
result has implications for data-informed operation and maintenance of
structures, suggesting a reduction in inspections over the operational lifetime
of a structure -- and therefore a reduction in operational costs -- can be
achieved.

TL;DR: TetraJet-v2是一种端到端的4位全量化训练方法，解决了低精度LLM训练中的权重振荡和异常值问题，性能优于现有FP4方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM训练成本高昂，低精度全量化训练（FQT）成为研究热点，但4位精度下的训练仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出TetraJet-v2，采用NVFP4格式，结合无偏双块量化、OsciReset和OutControl算法。

Result: 在多种模型和数据规模下，TetraJet-v2平均将性能差距缩小51.3%。

Conclusion: TetraJet-v2显著提升了4位FQT的训练效果，接近全精度训练。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) training is prohibitively expensive, driving
interest in low-precision fully-quantized training (FQT). While novel 4-bit
formats like NVFP4 offer substantial efficiency gains, achieving near-lossless
training at such low precision remains challenging. We introduce TetraJet-v2,
an end-to-end 4-bit FQT method that leverages NVFP4 for activations, weights,
and gradients in all linear layers. We identify two critical issues hindering
low-precision LLM training: weight oscillation and outliers. To address these,
we propose: 1) an unbiased double-block quantization method for NVFP4 linear
layers, 2) OsciReset, an algorithm to suppress weight oscillation, and 3)
OutControl, an algorithm to retain outlier accuracy. TetraJet-v2 consistently
outperforms prior FP4 training methods on pre-training LLMs across varying
model sizes up to 370M and data sizes up to 200B tokens, reducing the
performance gap to full-precision training by an average of 51.3%.

TL;DR: AstuteRAG-FQA是一个针对金融问答任务的自适应RAG框架，通过混合检索策略和动态提示工程解决金融领域的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域应用RAG面临数据访问限制、检索准确性低、监管约束和敏感数据问题，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 采用混合检索策略、动态提示框架和四层任务分类，结合多层安全机制和合规监控。

Result: 框架通过多种数据集成技术提高效率，并确保安全性和合规性。

Conclusion: AstuteRAG-FQA为金融问答任务提供了高效、安全且合规的解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) shows significant promise in
knowledge-intensive tasks by improving domain specificity, enhancing temporal
relevance, and reducing hallucinations. However, applying RAG to finance
encounters critical challenges: restricted access to proprietary datasets,
limited retrieval accuracy, regulatory constraints, and sensitive data
interpretation. We introduce AstuteRAG-FQA, an adaptive RAG framework tailored
for Financial Question Answering (FQA), leveraging task-aware prompt
engineering to address these challenges. The framework uses a hybrid retrieval
strategy integrating both open-source and proprietary financial data while
maintaining strict security protocols and regulatory compliance. A dynamic
prompt framework adapts in real time to query complexity, improving precision
and contextual relevance. To systematically address diverse financial queries,
we propose a four-tier task classification: explicit factual, implicit factual,
interpretable rationale, and hidden rationale involving implicit causal
reasoning. For each category, we identify key challenges, datasets, and
optimization techniques within the retrieval and generation process. The
framework incorporates multi-layered security mechanisms including differential
privacy, data anonymization, and role-based access controls to protect
sensitive financial information. Additionally, AstuteRAG-FQA implements
real-time compliance monitoring through automated regulatory validation systems
that verify responses against industry standards and legal obligations. We
evaluate three data integration techniques - contextual embedding, small model
augmentation, and targeted fine-tuning - analyzing their efficiency and
feasibility across varied financial environments.

Motivation: 工业应用中优化问题的建模需要大量手动工作和领域知识，现有评估方法存在不一致性、不可行性和高计算成本的问题。

Method: ORGEval将优化模型表示为图，利用对称可分解（SD）条件和Weisfeiler-Lehman（WL）测试检测图同构，从而评估模型等价性。

Conclusion: ORGEval为优化建模提供了高效且鲁棒的评估框架，揭示了LLMs在该任务中的潜力与挑战。

Abstract: Formulating optimization problems for industrial applications demands
significant manual effort and domain expertise. While Large Language Models
(LLMs) show promise in automating this process, evaluating their performance
remains difficult due to the absence of robust metrics. Existing solver-based
approaches often face inconsistency, infeasibility issues, and high
computational costs. To address these issues, we propose ORGEval, a
graph-theoretic evaluation framework for assessing LLMs' capabilities in
formulating linear and mixed-integer linear programs. ORGEval represents
optimization models as graphs, reducing equivalence detection to graph
isomorphism testing. We identify and prove a sufficient condition, when the
tested graphs are symmetric decomposable (SD), under which the
Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test is guaranteed to correctly detect isomorphism.
Building on this, ORGEval integrates a tailored variant of the WL-test with an
SD detection algorithm to evaluate model equivalence. By focusing on structural
equivalence rather than instance-level configurations, ORGEval is robust to
numerical variations. Experimental results show that our method can
successfully detect model equivalence and produce 100\% consistent results
across random parameter configurations, while significantly outperforming
solver-based methods in runtime, especially on difficult problems. Leveraging
ORGEval, we construct the Bench4Opt dataset and benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs
on optimization modeling. Our results reveal that although optimization
modeling remains challenging for all LLMs, DeepSeek-V3 and Claude-Opus-4
achieve the highest accuracies under direct prompting, outperforming even
leading reasoning models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种称为“panprediction”的新范式，旨在通过训练模型从数据中提取足够信息，以最小化多个下游任务的损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习关注固定损失函数和固定分布，而新范式旨在更灵活地适应多种损失和任务。

Method: 设计了确定性和随机性panpredictor算法，样本复杂度分别为$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$和$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$。

Result: 在温和假设下，同时最小化无限多任务和损失的统计复杂度与单一任务和损失相当。

Conclusion: panprediction在统计效率上优于传统方法，且能统一omniprediction和多组学习。

Abstract: Supervised learning is classically formulated as training a model to minimize
a fixed loss function over a fixed distribution, or task. However, an emerging
paradigm instead views model training as extracting enough information from
data so that the model can be used to minimize many losses on many downstream
tasks. We formalize a mathematical framework for this paradigm, which we call
panprediction, and study its statistical complexity. Formally, panprediction
generalizes omniprediction and sits upstream from multi-group learning, which
respectively focus on predictions that generalize to many downstream losses or
many downstream tasks, but not both. Concretely, we design algorithms that
learn deterministic and randomized panpredictors with
$\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^3)$ and $\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^2)$ samples,
respectively. Our results demonstrate that under mild assumptions,
simultaneously minimizing infinitely many losses on infinitely many tasks can
be as statistically easy as minimizing one loss on one task. Along the way, we
improve the best known sample complexity guarantee of deterministic
omniprediction by a factor of $1/\varepsilon$, and match all other known sample
complexity guarantees of omniprediction and multi-group learning. Our key
technical ingredient is a nearly lossless reduction from panprediction to a
statistically efficient notion of calibration, called step calibration.

Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的常见问题，传统方法多关注数据或损失重加权，而本文将其视为导致少数类欠规范化的数据条件，从而放大Clever Hans效应。

Method: 采用基于反事实解释的可解释AI方法，联合识别并消除不平衡条件下的Clever Hans效应。

Conclusion: 本文为类别不平衡问题提供了新视角，强调了可解释AI在解决此类问题中的潜力。

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a fundamental challenge in machine learning, frequently
leading to unreliable classification performance. While prior methods focus on
data- or loss-reweighting schemes, we view imbalance as a data condition that
amplifies Clever Hans (CH) effects by underspecification of minority classes.
In a counterfactual explanations-based approach, we propose to leverage
Explainable AI to jointly identify and eliminate CH effects emerging under
imbalance. Our method achieves competitive classification performance on three
datasets and demonstrates how CH effects emerge under imbalance, a perspective
largely overlooked by existing approaches.

Conclusion: 新方法在减少内存和计算负担的同时，保持了与传统训练方法相当的性能，适用于现代深度CNN。

Abstract: Modern deep neural networks (DNNs) are typically trained with a global
cross-entropy loss in a supervised end-to-end manner: neurons need to store
their outgoing weights; training alternates between a forward pass
(computation) and a top-down backward pass (learning) which is biologically
implausible. Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for
cross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of
intermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces
memory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding
gradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been
evaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In
this paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks
converge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information
adheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the
recently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the
matrix-based R\'enyi's $\alpha$-order entropy functional. Specifically, each
layer is trained jointly with an auxiliary classifier that connects directly to
the output layer, enabling the learning of minimal sufficient task-relevant
representations. We empirically validate the effectiveness of our training
procedure on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using modern deep CNNs and further
demonstrate its applicability to a practical task involving traffic sign
recognition. Our approach not only outperforms existing layer-wise training
baselines but also achieves performance comparable to SGD.

Motivation: 开放系统在MARL中具有动态性（如智能体、任务和类型的变化），而传统信用分配方法假设静态环境，无法适应这种动态性，因此需要研究开放性与CAP的关系。

Method: 通过概念分析提出新的开放性子类别，并使用代表性算法在开放环境中进行实证研究。

Result: 开放环境直接导致信用分配错误，表现为损失函数不稳定和性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 开放性是MARL中信用分配问题的重要挑战，需要开发适应动态环境的新方法。

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL),
understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers
to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a
system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et
al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at
any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or
disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents
change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,
focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem
(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the
overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open
environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static
agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making
them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,
in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent
turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental
stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We
then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural
algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness
directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and
significant performance degradation.
