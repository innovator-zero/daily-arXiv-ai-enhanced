The designs\nof these two devices were inspired by anguilliform swimming and are driven by\nsoft tails excited by high-work-density (HWD) actuators powered by shape-memory\nalloy (SMA) wires. While these propulsors have been demonstrated to be suitable\nfor microrobotic aquatic locomotion and controllable with simple architectures\nfor trajectory tracking in the two-dimensional (2D) space, the characteristics\nand magnitudes of the associated forces have not been studied systematically.\nIn the research presented here, we adopted a theoretical framework based on the\nnotion of reactive forces and obtained experimental data for characterization\nusing a custom-built micro-N-resolution force sensor. We measured maximum and\ncycle-averaged force values with multi-test means of respectively 0.45 mN and\n2.97 micro-N, for the tested single-tail propulsor. For the dual-tail\npropulsor, we measured maximum and cycle-averaged force values with multi-test\nmeans of 0.61 mN and 22.6 micro-N, respectively.

While prior work has explored data poisoning during\nstatic pre-training, the effects of such manipulations under continual\npre-training remain largely unexplored. Drawing inspiration from the illusory\ntruth effect in human cognition - where repeated exposure to falsehoods\nincreases belief in their accuracy - we ask whether LLMs exhibit a similar\nvulnerability.

However,\nautomatically generating contextually appropriate comments remains a\nchallenging and exciting task. Video streams can contain a vast amount of data\nand extraneous content. Existing approaches tend to overlook an important\naspect of prioritizing video frames that are most relevant to ongoing viewer\ninteractions. This prioritization is crucial for producing contextually\nappropriate comments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel Semantic Frame\nAggregation-based Transformer (SFAT) model for live video comment generation.\nThis method not only leverages CLIP's visual-text multimodal knowledge to\ngenerate comments but also assigns weights to video frames based on their\nsemantic relevance to ongoing viewer conversation. It employs an efficient\nweighted sum of frames technique to emphasize informative frames while focusing\nless on irrelevant ones. Finally, our comment decoder with a cross-attention\nmechanism that attends to each modality ensures that the generated comment\nreflects contextual cues from both chats and video.

Existing systems are mostly designed for\nlarge, open-water environments and struggle in industrial settings due to poor\ncoverage, reliance on external infrastructure, and the need for feature-rich\nsurroundings. Multipath effects from continuous sound reflections further\ndegrade signal quality, reducing accuracy and reliability. Accurate and easily\ndeployable positioning is essential for repeatable autonomous missions;\nhowever, this requirement has created a technological bottleneck limiting\nunderwater robotic deployment. This paper presents the Collaborative Aquatic\nPositioning (CAP) system, which integrates collaborative robotics and sensor\nfusion to overcome these limitations. Inspired by the \"mother-ship\" concept,\nthe surface vehicle acts as a mobile leader to assist in positioning a\nsubmerged robot, enabling localization even in GPS-denied and highly\nconstrained environments.

Drawing from aggregate census data, we compute the difference in\npredictive performance on racial and ethnic user groups and show a systematic\ndisparity resulting from the underlying dataset, resulting in large differences\nin accuracy based on location and user groups. To address this, we propose\nFairness-Guided Incremental Sampling (FGIS), a group-aware sampling strategy\ndesigned for incremental data collection settings. Because individual-level\ndemographic labels are unavailable, we introduce Size-Aware K-Means (SAKM), a\nclustering method that partitions users in latent mobility space while\nenforcing census-derived group proportions. This yields proxy racial labels for\nthe four largest groups in the state: Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White. Built\non these labels, our sampling algorithm prioritizes users based on expected\nperformance gains and current group representation. This method incrementally\nconstructs training datasets that reduce demographic performance gaps while\npreserving overall accuracy. Our method reduces total disparity between groups\nby up to 40\\% with minimal accuracy trade-offs, as evaluated on a state-of-art\nMetaPath2Vec model and a transformer-encoder model. Improvements are most\nsignificant in early sampling stages, highlighting the potential for\nfairness-aware strategies to deliver meaningful gains even in low-resource\nsettings.

Existing data-driven\napproaches often fail to generalize, constrained by narrowly focused task\ndemonstrations or inefficient random exploration. We introduce SoftAE, an\nuncertainty-aware active exploration framework that autonomously learns\ntask-agnostic and generalizable dynamics models of soft robotic systems.

Existing methods aim to capture spatial dependencies of\nquery objects between different views through attention mechanisms to obtain\nspatial relationship feature maps, which are then used to predict object\nlocations. Although promising, these approaches fail to effectively transfer\ninformation between views and do not further refine the spatial relationship\nfeature maps. This results in the model erroneously focusing on irrelevant edge\nnoise, thereby affecting localization performance. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce a Cross-view and Cross-attention Module (CVCAM),\nwhich performs multiple iterations of interaction between the two views,\nenabling continuous exchange and learning of contextual information about the\nquery object from both perspectives. This facilitates a deeper understanding of\ncross-view relationships while suppressing the edge noise unrelated to the\nquery object. Furthermore, we integrate a Multi-head Spatial Attention Module\n(MHSAM), which employs convolutional kernels of various sizes to extract\nmulti-scale spatial features from the feature maps containing implicit\ncorrespondences, further enhancing the feature representation of the query\nobject. Additionally, given the scarcity of datasets for cross-view object\ngeo-localization, we created a new dataset called G2D for the \"Ground-to-Drone\"\nlocalization task, enriching existing datasets and filling the gap in\n\"Ground-to-Drone\" localization task.

To tackle this, we propose AFM-Net, a novel Advanced\nHierarchical Fusing framework that achieves effective local and global\nco-representation through two pathways: a CNN branch for extracting\nhierarchical visual priors, and a Mamba branch for efficient global sequence\nmodeling.

Prior work by Huang et al.\n(2025) established that transformers eventually achieve length generalization\nonce the training sequence length exceeds some finite threshold, but left open\nthe question of how large it must be. In this work, we provide the first\nquantitative bounds on the required training length for length generalization\nto occur. Motivated by previous empirical and theoretical work, we analyze LG\nin several distinct problem settings: $\\ell_\\infty$ error control vs. average\nerror control over an input distribution, infinite-precision softmax attention\nvs. finite-precision attention (which reduces to an argmax) in the transformer,\nand one- vs. two-layer transformers.

In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers\nricher spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust\nand effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and\nmitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction.\nConsequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object\ndetection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal\ndata from camera and 4D imaging radar.

Models often adopt user beliefs (sycophancy) or satisfy\ninappropriate requests which are wrapped within special text (jailbreaking).

Instead of\nteaching the model what exact response to give on a particular prompt, we aim\nto teach the model to behave identically across prompt data augmentations (like\nadding leading questions or jailbreak text). We try enforcing this invariance\nin two ways: over the model's external outputs (\\emph{Bias-augmented\nConsistency Training} (BCT) from Chua et al.

While existing caching techniques can\naccelerate inference, they often create a challenging trade-off between speed\nand fidelity, suffering from quality degradation and high computational\noverhead. To address these limitations, we introduce H2-Cache, a novel\nhierarchical caching mechanism designed for modern generative diffusion model\narchitectures. Our method is founded on the key insight that the denoising\nprocess can be functionally separated into a structure-defining stage and a\ndetail-refining stage. H2-cache leverages this by employing a dual-threshold\nsystem, using independent thresholds to selectively cache each stage. To ensure\nthe efficiency of our dual-check approach, we introduce pooled feature\nsummarization (PFS), a lightweight technique for robust and fast similarity\nestimation. Extensive experiments on the Flux architecture demonstrate that\nH2-cache achieves significant acceleration (up to 5.08x) while maintaining\nimage quality nearly identical to the baseline, quantitatively and\nqualitatively outperforming existing caching methods. Our work presents a\nrobust and practical solution that effectively resolves the speed-quality\ndilemma, significantly lowering the barrier for the real-world application of\nhigh-fidelity diffusion models.

Achieving a robust\nand highly generalizable model in medical image diagnosis is challenging,\nmainly because of issues, such as the scarcity of large-scale, accurately\nannotated datasets and domain shifts inherent to dynamic healthcare\nenvironments. Specifically, in chest CT, these domain shifts often arise from\ndifferences in window settings, which are optimized for distinct clinical\npurposes. Previous CSSL frameworks often mitigated domain shift by reusing past\ndata, a typically impractical approach owing to privacy constraints.

However, the inherent heterogeneity of HSI data has\nlong posed a major barrier to developing generalized models via joint training.\nAlthough HSI foundation models have shown promise for different downstream\ntasks, the existing approaches typically overlook the critical guiding role of\nsensor meta-attributes, and struggle with multi-sensor training, limiting their\ntransferability. To address these challenges, we propose SpecAware, which is a\nnovel hyperspectral spectral-content aware foundation model for unifying\nmulti-sensor learning for HSI mapping. We also constructed the Hyper-400K\ndataset to facilitate this research, which is a new large-scale, high-quality\nbenchmark dataset with over 400k image patches from diverse airborne AVIRIS\nsensors. The core of SpecAware is a two-step hypernetwork-driven encoding\nprocess for HSI data. Firstly, we designed a meta-content aware module to\ngenerate a unique conditional input for each HSI patch, tailored to each\nspectral band of every sample by fusing the sensor meta-attributes and its own\nimage content. Secondly, we designed the HyperEmbedding module, where a\nsample-conditioned hypernetwork dynamically generates a pair of matrix factors\nfor channel-wise encoding, consisting of adaptive spatial pattern extraction\nand latent semantic feature re-projection. Thus, SpecAware gains the ability to\nperceive and interpret spatial-spectral features across diverse scenes and\nsensors. This, in turn, allows SpecAware to adaptively process a variable\nnumber of spectral channels, establishing a unified framework for joint\npre-training. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that SpecAware\ncan learn superior feature representations, excelling in land-cover semantic\nsegmentation classification, change detection, and scene classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpecAware\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5143\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u63d0\u5347HSI\u6620\u5c04\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5143\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u6b65\u8d85\u7f51\u7edc\u9a71\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u5143\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0cHyperEmbedding\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u751f\u6210\u77e9\u9635\u56e0\u5b50\u8fdb\u884c\u901a\u9053\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u571f\u5730\u8986\u76d6\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u53d8\u5316\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "SpecAware\u80fd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

The\nmain contributions of our framework can be summarized as follows: (i) To\nguarantee the representativeness of the training patches, we propose a\nmulti-view clustering-based method to filter out the discriminative patches via\nmultiple FMs' embeddings. (ii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\npatch-level FMs, we devise a cluster-level re-embedding strategy to online\ncapture patch-level local features. (iii) To effectively fuse the heterogeneous\nslide-level FMs, we devise a collaborative distillation strategy to explore the\nconnections between slide-level FMs. Extensive experiments conducted on lung\ncancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer datasets from The Cancer Genome\nAtlas (TCGA) have demonstrated that the proposed FuseCPath achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks on these public datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "FuseCPath\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u75c5\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u75c5\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u805a\u7c7b\u7b5b\u9009\u5224\u522b\u6027patch\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u805a\u7c7b\u7ea7\u91cd\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728TCGA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cFuseCPath\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "FuseCPath\u6709\u6548\u878d\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u75c5\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u3002"}}

We\nalso construct a multimodal response-quality dataset tailored for router\ntraining and validate the approach through extensive experiments.

While angiographic image\nanalysis from X-rays is a common and cost-effective method for identifying\ncardiac abnormalities, including stenotic coronary arteries, poor image quality\ncan significantly impede clinical diagnosis. We present the Coronary Artery\nSegmentation and Refinement Network (CASR-Net), a three-stage pipeline\ncomprising image preprocessing, segmentation, and refinement. A novel\nmultichannel preprocessing strategy combining CLAHE and an improved Ben Graham\nmethod provides incremental gains, increasing Dice Score Coefficient (DSC) by\n0.31-0.89% and Intersection over Union (IoU) by 0.40-1.16% compared with using\nthe techniques individually.

A final contour refinement module further\nsuppresses false positives. Evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation on a\ncombination of two public datasets that contain both healthy and stenotic\narteries, CASR-Net outperformed several state-of-the-art models, achieving an\nIoU of 61.43%, a DSC of 76.10%, and clDice of 79.36%.

To deal with complex editing instructions, they often need to jointly\nfine-tune the large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models (DMs), which\ninvolves very high computational complexity and training cost.

Most training data attribution (TDA)\nmethods ask which training examples causally influence a given output, often\nusing leave-one-out tests. We invert the question: which outputs cannot be\nattributed to any pretraining example? We introduce un-attributability as an\noperational measure of semantic novelty: an output is novel if the pretraining\ncorpus contains no semantically similar context. We approximate this with a\nsimple two-stage retrieval pipeline: index the corpus with lightweight GIST\nembeddings, retrieve the top-n candidates, then rerank with ColBERTv2. If the\nnearest corpus item is less attributable than a human-generated text reference,\nwe consider the output of the model as novel.

However, existing methods\nextract hierarchical features from text while representing each image with a\nsingle feature, leading to asymmetric and suboptimal alignment. To address\nthis, we propose Alignment across Trees, a method that constructs and aligns\ntree-like hierarchical features for both image and text modalities.\nSpecifically, we introduce a semantic-aware visual feature extraction framework\nthat applies a cross-attention mechanism to visual class tokens from\nintermediate Transformer layers, guided by textual cues to extract visual\nfeatures with coarse-to-fine semantics.

That is, how to achieve more effective local updates is crucial for\nreducing communication rounds. Existing FL methods still primarily use\nelement-wise local optimizers (Adam/SGD), neglecting the geometric structure of\nthe weight matrices. This often leads to the amplification of pathological\ndirections in the weights during local updates, leading deterioration in the\ncondition number and slow convergence. Therefore, we introduce the Muon\noptimizer in local, which has matrix orthogonalization to optimize\nmatrix-structured parameters. Experimental results show that, in IID setting,\nLocal Muon significantly accelerates the convergence of FL and reduces\ncommunication rounds compared to Local SGD and Local AdamW. However, in non-IID\nsetting, independent matrix orthogonalization based on the local distributions\nof each client induces strong client drift. Applying Muon in non-IID FL poses\nsignificant challenges: (1) client preconditioner leading to client drift; (2)\nmoment reinitialization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel\nFederated Muon optimizer (FedMuon), which incorporates two key techniques: (1)\nmomentum aggregation, where clients use the aggregated momentum for local\ninitialization; (2) local-global alignment, where the local gradients are\naligned with the global update direction to significantly reduce client drift.\nTheoretically, we prove that \\texttt{FedMuon} achieves a linear speedup\nconvergence rate without the heterogeneity assumption, where $S$ is the number\nof participating clients per round, $K$ is the number of local iterations, and\n$R$ is the total number of communication rounds.

We argue that studying a single sample is inadequate for\nunderstanding causal influence and the underlying computation. Though fully\nspecifying this distribution is intractable, it can be understood by sampling.\nWe present case studies using resampling to investigate model decisions. First,\nwhen a model states a reason for its action, does that reason actually cause\nthe action? In \"agentic misalignment\" scenarios, we resample specific sentences\nto measure their downstream effects. Self-preservation sentences have small\ncausal impact, suggesting they do not meaningfully drive blackmail. Second, are\nartificial edits to CoT sufficient for steering reasoning? These are common in\nliterature, yet take the model off-policy. Resampling and selecting a\ncompletion with the desired property is a principled on-policy alternative. We\nfind off-policy interventions yield small and unstable effects compared to\nresampling in decision-making tasks. Third, how do we understand the effect of\nremoving a reasoning step when the model may repeat it post-edit? We introduce\na resilience metric that repeatedly resamples to prevent similar content from\nreappearing downstream. Critical planning statements resist removal but have\nlarge effects when eliminated. Fourth, since CoT is sometimes \"unfaithful\", can\nour methods teach us anything in these settings? Adapting causal mediation\nanalysis, we find that hints that have a causal effect on the output without\nbeing explicitly mentioned exert a subtle and cumulative influence on the CoT\nthat persists even if the hint is removed.

However, directly applying AdamW in federated learning\nsettings poses significant challenges: (1) due to data heterogeneity, AdamW\noften yields high variance in the second-moment estimate $\\boldsymbol{v}$; (2)\nthe local overfitting of AdamW may cause client drift; and (3) Reinitializing\nmoment estimates ($\\boldsymbol{v}$, $\\boldsymbol{m}$) at each round slows down\nconvergence. To address these challenges, we propose the first\n\\underline{Fed}erated \\underline{AdamW} algorithm, called \\texttt{FedAdamW},\nfor training and fine-tuning various large models. \\texttt{FedAdamW} aligns\nlocal updates with the global update using both a \\textbf{local correction\nmechanism} and decoupled weight decay to mitigate local overfitting.\n\\texttt{FedAdamW} efficiently aggregates the \\texttt{mean} of the second-moment\nestimates to reduce their variance and reinitialize them.

However, current CL-DPFL methods usually\nresult in sharper loss landscapes, which leads to a decrease in model\ngeneralization after differential privacy protection. By using Sharpness Aware\nMinimization (SAM), the current popular federated learning methods are to find\na local flat minimum value to alleviate this problem. However, the local\nflatness may not reflect the global flatness in CL-DPFL. Therefore, to address\nthis issue and seek global flat minima of models, we propose a new CL-DPFL\nalgorithm, DP-FedPGN, in which we introduce a global gradient norm penalty to\nthe local loss to find the global flat minimum. Moreover, by using our global\ngradient norm penalty, we not only find a flatter global minimum but also\nreduce the locally updated norm, which means that we further reduce the error\nof gradient clipping. From a theoretical perspective, we analyze how DP-FedPGN\nmitigates the performance degradation caused by DP. Meanwhile, the proposed\nDP-FedPGN algorithm eliminates the impact of data heterogeneity and achieves\nfast convergence. We also use R\\'enyi DP to provide strict privacy guarantees\nand provide sensitivity analysis for local updates.

Traditional preconditioners\nrely on prescribed algorithms to offer rigorous theoretical guarantees, while\nlimiting their ability to exploit optimization from data. Existing\nlearning-based methods often utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve\nthe performance and speed up the construction. However, their reliance on\nincomplete factorization leads to significant challenges: the associated\ntriangular solve hinders GPU parallelization in practice, and introduces\nlong-range dependencies which are difficult for GNNs to model. To address these\nissues, we propose a learning-based method to generate GPU-friendly\npreconditioners, particularly using GNNs to construct Sparse Approximate\nInverse (SPAI) preconditioners, which avoids triangular solves and requires\nonly two matrix-vector products at each CG step. The locality of matrix-vector\nproduct is compatible with the local propagation mechanism of GNNs. The\nflexibility of GNNs also allows our approach to be applied in a wide range of\nscenarios.

Unlike traditional images\nor videos, 3D point clouds present unique challenges for copyright enforcement,\nas they are especially vulnerable to a range of geometric and non-geometric\nattacks that can easily degrade or remove conventional watermark signals. In\nthis paper, we address these challenges by proposing a robust deep neural\nwatermarking framework for 3D point cloud copyright protection and ownership\nverification. Our approach embeds binary watermarks into the singular values of\n3D point cloud blocks using spectral decomposition, i.e. Singular Value\nDecomposition (SVD), and leverages the extraction capabilities of Deep Learning\nusing PointNet++ neural network architecture. The network is trained to\nreliably extract watermarks even after the data undergoes various attacks such\nas rotation, scaling, noise, cropping and signal distortions. We validated our\nmethod using the publicly available ModelNet40 dataset, demonstrating that deep\nlearning-based extraction significantly outperforms traditional SVD-based\ntechniques under challenging conditions. Our experimental evaluation\ndemonstrates that the deep learning-based extraction approach significantly\noutperforms existing SVD-based methods with deep learning achieving bitwise\naccuracy up to 0.83 and Intersection over Union (IoU) of 0.80, compared to SVD\nachieving a bitwise accuracy of 0.58 and IoU of 0.26 for the Crop (70%) attack,\nwhich is the most severe geometric distortion in our experiment.

Alternatively, greedy layer-wise training eliminates the need for\ncross-entropy loss and backpropagation. By avoiding the computation of\nintermediate gradients and the storage of intermediate outputs, it reduces\nmemory usage and helps mitigate issues such as vanishing or exploding\ngradients. However, most existing layer-wise training approaches have been\nevaluated only on relatively small datasets with simple deep architectures. In\nthis paper, we first systematically analyze the training dynamics of popular\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained by stochastic gradient descent\n(SGD) through an information-theoretic lens. Our findings reveal that networks\nconverge layer-by-layer from bottom to top and that the flow of information\nadheres to a Markov information bottleneck principle. Building on these\nobservations, we propose a novel layer-wise training approach based on the\nrecently developed deterministic information bottleneck (DIB) and the\nmatrix-based R\\'enyi's $\\alpha$-order entropy functional.

Openness in MARL refers\nto the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a\nsystem. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et\nal. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at\nany time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or\ndisappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents\nchange over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review,\nfocusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem\n(CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the\noverall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open\nenviron-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static\nagent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making\nthem inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis,\nin-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent\nturnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental\nstationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We\nthen present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural\nalgorithms in an open environment.

Immutable\nheterogeneity poses a significant challenge in collaborative perception, as\nparticipating agents may employ different and fixed perception models. This\nleads to domain gaps in the intermediate features shared among agents,\nconsequently degrading collaborative performance. Aligning the features of all\nagents to a common representation can eliminate domain gaps with low training\ncost. However, in existing methods, the common representation is designated as\nthe representation of a specific agent, making it difficult for agents with\nsignificant domain discrepancies from this specific agent to achieve proper\nalignment. This paper proposes NegoCollab, a heterogeneous collaboration method\nbased on the negotiated common representation. It introduces a negotiator\nduring training to derive the common representation from the local\nrepresentations of each modality's agent, effectively reducing the inherent\ndomain gap with the various local representations.

Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the\nmost commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a\nsimilarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of\ntheir sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent\nstudies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for\nmeasuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we\nhave observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which\nnegatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when\nused as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes\nleads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD).\nThrough analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD\nnot only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization,\nwhich enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the\nAI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box\nregression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance across various detectors.

However,\nlimited model capacity causes one-step distilled models underperform on complex\ngenerative tasks, e.g., synthesizing intricate object motions in text-to-video\ngeneration. Directly extending DMD to multi-step distillation increases memory\nusage and computational depth, leading to instability and reduced efficiency.\nWhile prior works propose stochastic gradient truncation as a potential\nsolution, we observe that it substantially reduces the generation diversity of\nmulti-step distilled models, bringing it down to the level of their one-step\ncounterparts. To address these limitations, we propose Phased DMD, a multi-step\ndistillation framework that bridges the idea of phase-wise distillation with\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE), reducing learning difficulty while enhancing model\ncapacity. Phased DMD is built upon two key ideas: progressive distribution\nmatching and score matching within subintervals. First, our model divides the\nSNR range into subintervals, progressively refining the model to higher SNR\nlevels, to better capture complex distributions. Next, to ensure the training\nobjective within each subinterval is accurate, we have conducted rigorous\nmathematical derivations.

We present LifWavNet,\na lifting wavelet network based on a multi-resolution analysis and synthesis\n(MRAS) model for radar-to-ECG reconstruction. Unlike prior models that use\nfixed wavelet approaches, LifWavNet employs learnable lifting wavelets with\nlifting and inverse lifting units to adaptively capture radar signal features\nand synthesize physiologically meaningful ECG waveforms. To improve\nreconstruction fidelity, we introduce a multi-resolution short-time Fourier\ntransform (STFT) loss, that enforces consistency with the ground-truth ECG in\nboth temporal and spectral domains. Evaluations on two public datasets\ndemonstrate that LifWavNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in ECG\nreconstruction and downstream vital sign estimation (heart rate and heart rate\nvariability). Furthermore, intermediate feature visualization highlights the\ninterpretability of multi-resolution decomposition and synthesis in\nradar-to-ECG reconstruction.
