*Ivan Zvonkov,Gabriel Tseng,Inbal Becker-Reshef,Hannah Kerner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 评估地理空间嵌入在多哥农田制图中的实用性，简化工作流程并实现高精度分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的土地覆盖图对理解土地利用变化至关重要，但地理空间嵌入在实际应用中的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 使用Presto和AlphaEarth的地理空间嵌入生成农田地图。

Result: 地理空间嵌入能简化工作流程，实现高精度农田分类，支持更好地评估土地利用变化及其气候影响。

Conclusion: 地理空间嵌入在农田制图中具有实用性和高效性，有助于改善土地利用变化的评估。

Abstract: Accurate and up-to-date land cover maps are essential for understanding land
use change, a key driver of climate change. Geospatial embeddings offer a more
efficient and accessible way to map landscape features, yet their use in
real-world mapping applications remains underexplored. In this work, we
evaluated the utility of geospatial embeddings for cropland mapping in Togo. We
produced cropland maps using embeddings from Presto and AlphaEarth. Our
findings show that geospatial embeddings can simplify workflows, achieve
high-accuracy cropland classification and ultimately support better assessments
of land use change and its climate impacts.

### [2] [Generative Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02933)
*Andy Dimnaku,Abdullah Yusuf Kavranoğlu,Yaser Abu-Mostafa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 生成式提示方法通过生成虚拟样本直接强化模型对不变性的学习，优于传统数据增强方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强仅在训练数据上学习不变性，未能完全捕捉输入空间的不变性。

Method: 利用生成模型生成虚拟样本，结合半监督学习同时优化分类和不变性目标。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上，生成式提示方法显著优于数据增强，最高提升1.78%准确率。

Conclusion: 生成式提示是一种有效的训练方法，能够直接强化模型对不变性的学习，提升性能。

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and
mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties,
such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by
data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on
transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a
training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire
input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training
set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which
we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce
functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the
training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised
manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled
virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across
datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently
outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On
popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78%
top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data
augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray
dataset.

### [3] [ProM3E: Probabilistic Masked MultiModal Embedding Model for Ecology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02946)
*Srikumar Sastry,Subash Khanal,Aayush Dhakal,Jiayu Lin,Dan Cher,Phoenix Jarosz,Nathan Jacobs*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProM3E是一个概率掩码多模态嵌入模型，支持生态学中的任意到任意多模态表示生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态数据融合和缺失模态推断的问题，提升跨模态检索和表示学习能力。

Method: 基于掩码模态重建，学习在嵌入空间中推断缺失模态，支持模态反转和概率分析。

Result: 提出了一种新颖的跨模态检索方法，并在线性探测任务中展示了优越的表示学习能力。

Conclusion: ProM3E在多模态融合和表示学习方面表现出色，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: We introduce ProM3E, a probabilistic masked multimodal embedding model for
any-to-any generation of multimodal representations for ecology. ProM3E is
based on masked modality reconstruction in the embedding space, learning to
infer missing modalities given a few context modalities. By design, our model
supports modality inversion in the embedding space. The probabilistic nature of
our model allows us to analyse the feasibility of fusing various modalities for
given downstream tasks, essentially learning what to fuse. Using these features
of our model, we propose a novel cross-modal retrieval approach that mixes
inter-modal and intra-modal similarities to achieve superior performance across
all retrieval tasks. We further leverage the hidden representation from our
model to perform linear probing tasks and demonstrate the superior
representation learning capability of our model. All our code, datasets and
model will be released at https://vishu26.github.io/prom3e.

### [4] [EvtSlowTV - A Large and Diverse Dataset for Event-Based Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02953)
*Sadiq Layi Macaulay,Nimet Kaygusuz,Simon Hadfield*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EvtSlowTV是一个大规模事件相机数据集，用于提升事件相机在深度估计中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有事件相机数据集规模小、泛化能力不足的问题。

Method: 利用YouTube公开视频构建EvtSlowTV数据集，支持自监督学习框架。

Result: EvtSlowTV显著提升模型在复杂场景和运动中的泛化能力。

Conclusion: EvtSlowTV为事件相机深度估计提供了更自然、无约束的数据支持。

Abstract: Event cameras, with their high dynamic range (HDR) and low latency, offer a
promising alternative for robust depth estimation in challenging environments.
However, many event-based depth estimation approaches are constrained by
small-scale annotated datasets, limiting their generalizability to real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EvtSlowTV, a large-scale event
camera dataset curated from publicly available YouTube footage, which contains
more than 13B events across various environmental conditions and motions,
including seasonal hiking, flying, scenic driving, and underwater exploration.
EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets,
providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth
learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised
learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams. We
further demonstrate that training with EvtSlowTV enhances the model's ability
to generalise to complex scenes and motions. Our approach removes the need for
frame-based annotations and preserves the asynchronous nature of event data.

### [5] [Hybrid Convolution and Vision Transformer NAS Search Space for TinyML Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02992)
*Mikhael Djajapermana,Moritz Reiber,Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder,Ulf Schlichtmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的混合CNN-ViT搜索空间，用于NAS，以寻找高效的图像分类架构，适用于tinyML部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合CNN-ViT架构参数量大、计算成本高，不适合tinyML部署。

Method: 设计了混合CNN-ViT搜索空间，包含可搜索的池化层块，用于高效特征图降维。

Result: 在CIFAR10数据集上，提出的搜索空间生成的架构在模型大小受限下优于ResNet-based tinyML模型。

Conclusion: 新搜索空间能生成高效且高精度的混合CNN-ViT架构，适用于tinyML。

Abstract: Hybrids of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT)
have outperformed pure CNN or ViT architecture. However, since these
architectures require large parameters and incur large computational costs,
they are unsuitable for tinyML deployment. This paper introduces a new hybrid
CNN-ViT search space for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find efficient
hybrid architectures for image classification. The search space covers hybrid
CNN and ViT blocks to learn local and global information, as well as the novel
Pooling block of searchable pooling layers for efficient feature map reduction.
Experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset show that our proposed search space
can produce hybrid CNN-ViT architectures with superior accuracy and inference
speed to ResNet-based tinyML models under tight model size constraints.

### [6] [SCALE-VLP: Soft-Weighted Contrastive Volumetric Vision-Language Pre-training with Spatial-Knowledge Semantics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02996)
*Ailar Mahdizadeh,Puria Azadi Moghadam,Xiangteng He,Shahriar Mirabbasi,Panos Nasiopoulos,Leonid Sigal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SCALE-VLP是一个软加权对比视觉语言预训练框架，专注于处理体积数据（如CT扫描），通过整合体积空间语义和领域感知知识，显著提升了跨任务和跨领域的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型主要局限于2D数据和二元监督，忽略了体积数据的连续性和结构化依赖关系，导致空间一致性和临床语义的利用不足。

Method: SCALE-VLP结合体积空间语义（保留解剖结构）和领域感知知识（如放射学本体），在有限监督下生成结构一致且语义基础的表示。

Result: SCALE-VLP在CT报告检索、异常分类和报告生成任务中表现优异，分别达到4.3倍更高的Top-1检索率、10分的分类提升，以及ROUGE-L 0.44和BERT-F1 0.89的生成分数。

Conclusion: SCALE-VLP展示了强大的跨任务和跨领域泛化能力，无需微调即可在外部数据集上取得一致增益。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong cross-modal
capabilities, yet most work remains limited to 2D data and assumes binary
supervision (i.e., positive vs. negative pairs), overlooking the continuous and
structured dependencies present in volumetric data such as CT. Existing
approaches often treat volumetric scans as independent 2D slices, compromising
spatial coherence and underutilizing rich clinical semantics. We propose
SCALE-VLP, a soft-weighted contrastive vision-language pre-training framework
that integrates (i) volumetric spatial semantics to preserve anatomical
structure and (ii) domain-aware, knowledge-infused semantics (e.g.,
radiological ontologies) to guide alignment. This yields structurally
consistent and semantically grounded representations under limited supervision,
demonstrating strong cross-task transferability (retrieval, report generation,
and classification), and cross-domain generalizability with consistent gains
without further fine-tuning. In particular, compared to the previous state of
the art, SCALE-VLP achieves up to 4.3x higher top-1 CT-report retrieval,
improves abnormality classification by 10 points, and reaches ROUGE-L 0.44 and
BERT-F1 0.89 for report generation. Further, in zero-shot evaluation on an
out-of-domain external dataset, we observe consistent gains, indicating the
cross-task and cross-domain generalization ability of SCALE-VLP.

### [7] [Learning with less: label-efficient land cover classification at very high spatial resolution using self-supervised deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03004)
*Dakota Hester,Vitor S. Martins,Lucas B. Ferreira,Thainara M. A. Lima*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自监督学习的标签高效方法，用于州级1米分辨率土地覆盖分类，仅需1000个标注样本，取得了87.14%的总体准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高分辨率土地覆盖分类中大规模标注数据收集的难题。

Method: 使用自监督学习预训练ResNet-101编码器，并迁移至多种语义分割架构进行微调。

Result: 在密西西比州1230亿像素的8类土地覆盖分类中，总体准确率达87.14%。

Conclusion: 自监督学习能显著减少对大量标注数据的需求，适用于大规模高分辨率土地覆盖分类。

Abstract: Deep learning semantic segmentation methods have shown promising performance
for very high 1-m resolution land cover classification, but the challenge of
collecting large volumes of representative training data creates a significant
barrier to widespread adoption of such models for meter-scale land cover
mapping over large areas. In this study, we present a novel label-efficient
approach for statewide 1-m land cover classification using only 1,000 annotated
reference image patches with self-supervised deep learning. We use the
"Bootstrap Your Own Latent" pre-training strategy with a large amount of
unlabeled color-infrared aerial images (377,921 256x256 1-m pixel patches) to
pre-train a ResNet-101 convolutional encoder. The learned encoder weights were
subsequently transferred into multiple deep semantic segmentation architectures
(FCN, U-Net, Attention U-Net, DeepLabV3+, UPerNet, PAN), which were then
fine-tuned using very small training dataset sizes with cross-validation (250,
500, 750 patches). Among the fine-tuned models, we obtained the 87.14% overall
accuracy and 75.58% macro F1 score using an ensemble of the best performing
U-Net models for comprehensive 1-m, 8-class land cover mapping, covering more
than 123 billion pixels over the state of Mississippi, USA. Detailed
qualitative and quantitative analysis revealed accurate mapping of open water
and forested areas, while highlighting challenges in accurate delineation
between cropland, herbaceous, and barren land cover types. These results show
that self-supervised learning is an effective strategy for reducing the need
for large volumes of manually annotated data, directly addressing a major
limitation to high spatial resolution land cover mapping at scale.

### [8] [A Foundation Model for Brain MRI with Dynamic Modality Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03014)
*Minh Sao Khue Luu,Bair N. Tuchinov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种适用于不同MRI序列组合的基础模型，通过可学习模态嵌入和掩码自编码目标处理缺失模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态MRI数据中缺失或未见序列的问题，避免为每种模态单独训练模型。

Method: 使用带可学习模态嵌入的编码器、条件层归一化和掩码自编码目标，结合方差-协方差正则化器稳定特征学习。

Result: 初步结果显示方法可行，计划进一步评估其在脑肿瘤和多发性硬化分割等任务中的表现。

Conclusion: 该模型能灵活适应不同模态组合，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: We present a foundation model for brain MRI that can work with different
combinations of imaging sequences. The model uses one encoder with learnable
modality embeddings, conditional layer normalization, and a masked autoencoding
objective that accounts for missing modalities. A variance-covariance
regularizer is applied to stabilize feature learning and improve representation
diversity. This design removes the need for separate models for each modality
and allows the network to adapt when some sequences are missing or unseen. It
is trained on about 60,000 multi-center MRIs using self-supervised
reconstruction and modality imputation to learn flexible representations. A
learnable modality embedding guides feature extraction so the encoder can
adjust to different inputs. We describe our planned evaluation on brain tumor
and multiple sclerosis segmentation, as well as lesion classification, under
various modality settings. Preliminary results show that the method works
feasibly, and further experiments are planned to study its performance in more
detail. All code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/BrainFM/brainfm

### [9] [SLIP: Structural-aware Language-Image Pretraining for Vision-Language Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03019)
*Wenbo Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SLIP是一种结合结构化对比损失的多模态预训练方法，通过建模实体间关系提升跨模态对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLP方法忽视数据中的丰富关系结构，而人类认知依赖关系图谱，因此提出SLIP以利用结构化信息。

Method: 引入结构化对比损失，结合邻接实体关系建模，并构建亚马逊产品共购多模态图数据集。

Result: SLIP在零样本和小样本跨模态检索与分类任务中均优于CLIP。

Conclusion: 关系监督对跨模态对齐具有显著价值。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has achieved remarkable success across
various downstream tasks, but such gains are largely driven by scaling up on
training data. Yet, literature methods treat image-text pairs as isolated
training examples; this neglects the rich relational structure naturally
present in many domains, such as e-commerce product co-purchase graphs and
social recommendation networks. Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human
encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware
Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive
loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring
entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a
large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling
structured cross-modality supervision at scale. Experiment results show that
SLIP consistently outperforms CLIP on cross-modal retrieval and classification
tasks in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, showing the value of relational
supervision for cross-modal alignment.

### [10] [From Propagation to Prediction: Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of MLS Point Clouds under Limited Ground Truth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03053)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于学习的框架，用于评估移动激光扫描（MLS）点云的不确定性，减少对地面真实数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在许多高精度应用中，评估MLS点云的不确定性至关重要，但获取地面真实数据成本高且不可行。

Method: 结合最优邻域估计和几何特征提取的学习框架，使用XGBoost模型进行预测。

Result: 实验表明，该框架可行，XGBoost模型在精度上与随机森林相当，但效率提高了约3倍。

Conclusion: 研究表明，MLS点云的不确定性是可学习的，为不确定性评估研究提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Evaluating uncertainty is critical for reliable use of Mobile Laser Scanning
(MLS) point clouds in many high-precision applications such as Scan-to-BIM,
deformation analysis, and 3D modeling. However, obtaining the ground truth (GT)
for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications.
To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research,
this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that
integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction.
Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is
feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random
Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster),
providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict
point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study
shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel
learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.

### [11] [A Plug-and-Play Framework for Volumetric Light-Sheet Image Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03093)
*Yi Gong,Xinyuan Zhang,Jichen Chai,Yichen Ding,Yifei Lou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合压缩感知和光片显微镜的高性能计算成像框架，用于高效、低光毒性的心脏成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统光学成像在捕捉跳动心脏的动态细胞结构时存在时空分辨率权衡的局限性。

Method: 通过数字微镜设备进行随机二进制掩码编码的压缩采集，采用Plug-and-Play框架结合ADMM算法，并引入时间正则化。

Result: 在斑马鱼心脏成像实验中，该方法在高压缩比下成功重建细胞结构，表现出优异的去噪性能和图像清晰度。

Conclusion: 该算法在实际高速、低光生物成像场景中具有有效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Cardiac contraction is a rapid, coordinated process that unfolds across
three-dimensional tissue on millisecond timescales. Traditional optical imaging
is often inadequate for capturing dynamic cellular structure in the beating
heart because of a fundamental trade-off between spatial and temporal
resolution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-performance
computational imaging framework that integrates Compressive Sensing (CS) with
Light-Sheet Microscopy (LSM) for efficient, low-phototoxic cardiac imaging. The
system performs compressed acquisition of fluorescence signals via random
binary mask coding using a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD). We propose a
Plug-and-Play (PnP) framework, solved using the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM), which flexibly incorporates advanced denoisers, including
Tikhonov, Total Variation (TV), and BM3D. To preserve structural continuity in
dynamic imaging, we further introduce temporal regularization enforcing
smoothness between adjacent z-slices. Experimental results on zebrafish heart
imaging under high compression ratios demonstrate that the proposed method
successfully reconstructs cellular structures with excellent denoising
performance and image clarity, validating the effectiveness and robustness of
our algorithm in real-world high-speed, low-light biological imaging scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ISC-Perception是一个混合数据集，用于加速钢框架组件的机器人检测，结合了CAD图像、游戏引擎场景和真实照片，显著减少了人工标注时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于在建筑工地收集图像存在物流和安全隐私问题，缺乏专用图像库阻碍了ISC感知机器人的发展。

Method: 创建了ISC-Perception数据集，混合了程序化渲染的CAD图像、游戏引擎场景和少量真实照片，实现自动标注。

Result: 在10,000张图像的数据集上，人工时间减少了81.7%，检测器性能显著优于仅使用合成或真实数据的模型。

Conclusion: ISC-Perception填补了建筑机器人感知的数据缺口，支持快速开发定制检测器，并免费供研究和工业使用。

Abstract: The Intermeshed Steel Connection (ISC) system, when paired with robotic
manipulators, can accelerate steel-frame assembly and improve worker safety by
eliminating manual assembly. Dependable perception is one of the initial stages
for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated
image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is
logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we
introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC
component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine
photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling
fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for
all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene
setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total
human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for
manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative
image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring
the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean
Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained
on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we
report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for
construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development
of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial
use upon request.

### [13] [DentalSplat: Dental Occlusion Novel View Synthesis from Sparse Intra-Oral Photographs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03099)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DentalSplat框架通过先验引导的密集立体重建和尺度自适应剪枝策略，解决了稀疏视角下3D高斯溅射重建的挑战，提升了牙科咬合可视化的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在正畸治疗中，稀疏视角（如前视图和双侧颊视图）的3D重建质量差，且缺乏相机姿态信息，限制了3D高斯溅射技术的实用性。

Method: 结合先验引导的密集立体重建初始化点云，采用尺度自适应剪枝策略，并在极端稀疏视角下引入光流几何约束和梯度正则化。

Result: 在950例临床数据和195例视频测试集上验证，DentalSplat在稀疏输入下表现优异，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: DentalSplat为稀疏正畸图像提供了高效的3D重建方案，提升了远程牙科咬合可视化的质量。

Abstract: In orthodontic treatment, particularly within telemedicine contexts,
observing patients' dental occlusion from multiple viewpoints facilitates
timely clinical decision-making. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) have shown strong potential in 3D reconstruction and novel view
synthesis. However, conventional 3DGS pipelines typically rely on densely
captured multi-view inputs and precisely initialized camera poses, limiting
their practicality. Orthodontic cases, in contrast, often comprise only three
sparse images, specifically, the anterior view and bilateral buccal views,
rendering the reconstruction task especially challenging. The extreme sparsity
of input views severely degrades reconstruction quality, while the absence of
camera pose information further complicates the process. To overcome these
limitations, we propose DentalSplat, an effective framework for 3D
reconstruction from sparse orthodontic imagery. Our method leverages a
prior-guided dense stereo reconstruction model to initialize the point cloud,
followed by a scale-adaptive pruning strategy to improve the training
efficiency and reconstruction quality of 3DGS. In scenarios with extremely
sparse viewpoints, we further incorporate optical flow as a geometric
constraint, coupled with gradient regularization, to enhance rendering
fidelity. We validate our approach on a large-scale dataset comprising 950
clinical cases and an additional video-based test set of 195 cases designed to
simulate real-world remote orthodontic imaging conditions. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method effectively handles sparse input scenarios and
achieves superior novel view synthesis quality for dental occlusion
visualization, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques.

### [14] [Image-Intrinsic Priors for Integrated Circuit Defect Detection and Novel Class Discovery via Self-Supervised Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03120)
*Botong. Zhao,Xubin. Wang,Shujing. Lyu,Yue. Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IC DefectNCD是一种无需支持集的框架，利用IC SEM图像中的固有先验进行缺陷检测和新类别发现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 集成电路制造复杂，缺陷可能导致产量损失和可靠性下降。现有监督方法需要大量标注且难以处理新类别和罕见缺陷，无监督聚类方法因缺乏先验而不稳定。

Method: 提出Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection和Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification，结合自适应二值化和软掩模注意力机制。

Result: 在真实数据集上验证，覆盖15种缺陷类型，表现出稳健的缺陷检测和未见缺陷分类性能。

Conclusion: IC DefectNCD通过固有先验和自适应策略，有效解决了缺陷检测和新类别发现的挑战。

Abstract: Integrated circuit manufacturing is highly complex, comprising hundreds of
process steps. Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and
ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive
human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce
defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable
performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free
framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect
detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information
Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a
learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to
coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects,
we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages
focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information
Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided
attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student
model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background
interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We
validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication
stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance
on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.

*Hongbo Lan,Zhenlin An,Haoyu Li,Vaibhav Singh,Longfei Shangguan*

TL;DR: \sysname 通过算法和系统优化，将视觉引导的物理属性推理时间从10-20分钟缩短至6秒以内，并在准确性和性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升视觉引导的物理属性推理的速度和效率，以支持增强视觉认知。

Method: 结合快速几何3D重建、高效语义特征融合和并行视图编码等优化技术。

Result: 在ABO数据集上，\sysname 实现了62.9倍到287.2倍的加速，同时保持了高准确性，并在材料分割和体素级推理上表现优异。

Conclusion: \sysname 在真实场景中表现稳健，结合眼动追踪技术，可高效定位目标物体并提供准确的物理属性估计。

Abstract: This paper introduces \sysname, a system that accelerates vision-guided
physical property reasoning to enable augmented visual cognition. \sysname
minimizes the run-time latency of this reasoning pipeline through a combination
of both algorithmic and systematic optimizations, including rapid geometric 3D
reconstruction, efficient semantic feature fusion, and parallel view encoding.
Through these simple yet effective optimizations, \sysname reduces the
end-to-end latency of this reasoning pipeline from 10--20 minutes to less than
6 seconds. A head-to-head comparison on the ABO dataset shows that \sysname
achieves this 62.9$\times$--287.2$\times$ speedup while not only reaching
on-par (and sometimes slightly better) object-level physical property
estimation accuracy(e.g. mass), but also demonstrating superior performance in
material segmentation and voxel-level inference than two SOTA baselines. We
further combine gaze-tracking with \sysname to localize the object of interest
in cluttered, real-world environments, streamlining the physical property
reasoning on smart glasses. The case study with Meta Aria Glasses conducted at
an IKEA furniture store demonstrates that \sysname achives consistently high
performance compared to controlled captures, providing robust property
estimations even with fewer views in real-world scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决灾难现场图像数据过多导致响应延迟的问题。

Method: 利用计算机视觉和机器学习技术，训练模型并部署于实际灾难响应。

Result: 模型在18分钟内评估了415座建筑物。

Conclusion: 该研究为AI/ML在灾难评估中的实际应用提供了经验和教训。

Abstract: This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage
assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed
operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and
Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect
imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters,
teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day,
representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by
subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts.
To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and
machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed
to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state
of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has
been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice
via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment
with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known
dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage
labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best
performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and
Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes.
This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage
assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML
research and user communities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需微调的个性化文本到图像扩散模型方法，通过超网络直接预测LoRA权重，解决了传统方法计算成本高的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统个性化方法依赖特定主题的微调，计算成本高且推理慢，需要更高效且无需微调的解决方案。

Method: 使用超网络预测LoRA权重，结合端到端训练目标和输出正则化，提出HM-CFG增强组合泛化能力。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ、AFHQ-v2和DreamBench上验证了方法的有效性，实现了高保真度和提示对齐。

Conclusion: 超网络是一种可扩展且高效的开放类别个性化方向，无需测试时优化。

Abstract: Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on
subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as
DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and
slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce
this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone
models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal
direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict
LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based
approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to
mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with
an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization,
yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for
per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity
and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at
inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG),
which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the
subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments
on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves
strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks
as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合RGB和深度特征的双编码器框架，用于腹腔镜肝脏手术中的地标分割，通过SRFT-GaLore方法高效微调模型，显著提升了分割精度和跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中2D视频流限制了深度感知，导致地标定位困难，现有方法在RGB和深度特征融合及大模型适配手术领域方面仍有挑战。

Method: 使用SAM2和DA2编码器分别提取RGB和深度特征，引入SRFT-GaLore低秩梯度投影方法高效微调模型，并通过交叉注意力融合模块整合特征。

Result: 在L3D数据集上Dice系数提升4.85%，平均对称表面距离降低11.78点；在LLSD数据集上表现优于基线，展示了强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SRFT-GaLore增强的双编码器框架在实时、深度受限的手术场景中实现了可扩展且精确的分割。

Abstract: Accurate detection and delineation of anatomical structures in medical
imaging are critical for computer-assisted interventions, particularly in
laparoscopic liver surgery where 2D video streams limit depth perception and
complicate landmark localization. While recent works have leveraged monocular
depth cues for enhanced landmark detection, challenges remain in fusing RGB and
depth features and in efficiently adapting large-scale vision models to
surgical domains. We propose a depth-guided liver landmark segmentation
framework integrating semantic and geometric cues via vision foundation
encoders. We employ Segment Anything Model V2 (SAM2) encoder to extract RGB
features and Depth Anything V2 (DA2) encoder to extract depth-aware features.
To efficiently adapt SAM2, we introduce SRFT-GaLore, a novel low-rank gradient
projection method that replaces the computationally expensive SVD with a
Subsampled Randomized Fourier Transform (SRFT). This enables efficient
fine-tuning of high-dimensional attention layers without sacrificing
representational power. A cross-attention fusion module further integrates RGB
and depth cues. To assess cross-dataset generalization, we also construct a new
Laparoscopic Liver Surgical Dataset (LLSD) as an external validation benchmark.
On the public L3D dataset, our method achieves a 4.85% improvement in Dice
Similarity Coefficient and a 11.78-point reduction in Average Symmetric Surface
Distance compared to the D2GPLand. To further assess generalization capability,
we evaluate our model on LLSD dataset. Our model maintains competitive
performance and significantly outperforms SAM-based baselines, demonstrating
strong cross-dataset robustness and adaptability to unseen surgical
environments. These results demonstrate that our SRFT-GaLore-enhanced
dual-encoder framework enables scalable and precise segmentation under
real-time, depth-constrained surgical settings.

TL;DR: 提出了首个用于前瞻性手术推理的VQA数据集PitVQA-Anticipation，并开发了视频语言模型SurgAnt-ViVQA，通过时间感知编码和门控交叉注意力提升手术VQA的预测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术VQA系统仅关注当前场景，缺乏对未来事件的预测能力，限制了实时手术辅助的效果。

Method: 构建了包含33.5小时手术视频和734,769问答对的数据集，提出SurgAnt-ViVQA模型，结合GRU门控时间交叉注意力模块和参数高效微调。

Result: 模型在PitVQA-Anticipation和EndoVis数据集上超越基线，时间递归和门控融合是性能提升的关键。

Conclusion: 通过时间建模和细粒度门控注意力，SurgAnt-ViVQA将手术VQA从回顾性描述推进到前瞻性预测，为未来感知的手术辅助提供了新方向。

Abstract: Anticipating forthcoming surgical events is vital for real-time assistance in
endonasal transsphenoidal pituitary surgery, where visibility is limited and
workflow changes rapidly. Most visual question answering (VQA) systems reason
on isolated frames with static vision language alignment, providing little
support for forecasting next steps or instrument needs. Existing surgical VQA
datasets likewise center on the current scene rather than the near future. We
introduce PitVQA-Anticipation, the first VQA dataset designed for forward
looking surgical reasoning. It comprises 33.5 hours of operative video and
734,769 question answer pairs built from temporally grouped clips and expert
annotations across four tasks: predicting the future phase, next step, upcoming
instrument, and remaining duration. We further propose SurgAnt-ViVQA, a video
language model that adapts a large language model using a GRU Gated Temporal
Cross-Attention module. A bidirectional GRU encodes frame to frame dynamics,
while an adaptive gate injects visual context into the language stream at the
token level. Parameter efficient fine tuning customizes the language backbone
to the surgical domain. SurgAnt-ViVQA tested upon on PitVQA-Anticipation and
EndoVis datasets, surpassing strong image and video based baselines. Ablations
show that temporal recurrence and gated fusion drive most of the gains. A frame
budget study indicates a trade-off: 8 frames maximize fluency, whereas 32
frames slightly reduce BLEU but improve numeric time estimation. By pairing a
temporally aware encoder with fine grained gated cross-attention, SurgAnt-ViVQA
advances surgical VQA from retrospective description to proactive anticipation.
PitVQA-Anticipation offers a comprehensive benchmark for this setting and
highlights the importance of targeted temporal modeling for reliable, future
aware surgical assistance.

Motivation: 现有方法在多图像场景中缺乏细粒度感知和有效推理能力，且研究多集中于单图像或特定场景。

Method: 提出QG-CoC方法，通过问题引导的标题链（Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions）处理任意数量的图像。

Result: 实验表明QG-CoC在多种任务中表现优异，尤其在现有方法失败的复杂场景中表现稳健。

Conclusion: QG-CoC是一种通用的提示方法，能有效提升多模态大语言模型在多图像任务中的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter two key issues
in multi-image contexts: (1) a lack of fine-grained perception across disparate
images, and (2) a diminished capability to effectively reason over and
synthesize information from multiple visual inputs. However, while various
prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus
primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This
leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more
general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively
investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details
and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings
reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues
and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings,
we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions
(QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems
with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various
open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image
benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive
performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging
scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.

Conclusion: MvBody为资源有限环境提供了一种高效、透明的剖宫产风险预测工具，未来可推广至更经济的设备。

Abstract: Accurately assessing the risk of cesarean section (CS) delivery is critical,
especially in settings with limited medical resources, where access to
healthcare is often restricted. Early and reliable risk prediction allows
better-informed prenatal care decisions and can improve maternal and neonatal
outcomes. However, most existing predictive models are tailored for in-hospital
use during labor and rely on parameters that are often unavailable in
resource-limited or home-based settings. In this study, we conduct a pilot
investigation to examine the feasibility of using 3D body shape for CS risk
assessment for future applications with more affordable general devices. We
propose a novel multi-view-based Transformer network, MvBody, which predicts CS
risk using only self-reported medical data and 3D optical body scans obtained
between the 31st and 38th weeks of gestation. To enhance training efficiency
and model generalizability in data-scarce environments, we incorporate a metric
learning loss into the network. Compared to widely used machine learning models
and the latest advanced 3D analysis methods, our method demonstrates superior
performance, achieving an accuracy of 84.62% and an Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.724 on the independent test set.
To improve transparency and trust in the model's predictions, we apply the
Integrated Gradients algorithm to provide theoretically grounded explanations
of the model's decision-making process. Our results indicate that pre-pregnancy
weight, maternal age, obstetric history, previous CS history, and body shape,
particularly around the head and shoulders, are key contributors to CS risk
prediction.

Motivation: 解决样本混合导致的标签模糊和扩散合成引入的领域偏移问题，结合两者的优势以提升分割性能。

Method: 提出MCPMix方法，在相同掩码下生成合成图像对，仅混合外观并保持原始硬标签；结合RLA自适应调整混合强度和损失权重。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的分割性能，展示了方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 结合标签保留的混合和扩散驱动的多样性，通过自适应调整，能够实现鲁棒且可泛化的内窥镜分割。

Abstract: Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or
generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield
soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but,
when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask
conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired,
diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real
image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is
used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which
mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard
mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly
bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging
diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned
with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the
mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually
re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias.
Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC
2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and
consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining
label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive
re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.

Result: 实验表明T-PMambaSR在性能和计算成本上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: T-PMambaSR通过渐进式建模和高频细节恢复，显著提升了超分辨率任务的性能。

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based super-resolution (SR) methods have demonstrated the
ability to capture global receptive fields with linear complexity, addressing
the quadratic computational cost of Transformer-based SR approaches. However,
existing Mamba-based methods lack fine-grained transitions across different
modeling scales, which limits the efficiency of feature representation. In this
paper, we propose T-PMambaSR, a lightweight SR framework that integrates
window-based self-attention with Progressive Mamba. By enabling interactions
among receptive fields of different scales, our method establishes a
fine-grained modeling paradigm that progressively enhances feature
representation with linear complexity. Furthermore, we introduce an Adaptive
High-Frequency Refinement Module (AHFRM) to recover high-frequency details lost
during Transformer and Mamba processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
T-PMambaSR progressively enhances the model's receptive field and
expressiveness, yielding better performance than recent Transformer- or
Mamba-based methods while incurring lower computational cost. Our codes will be
released after acceptance.

Conclusion: DMPO通过架构和优化策略有效解耦早期阶段的表示与判别能力，为高效推理提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Recently, remarkable progress has been made in large-scale pre-trained model
tuning, and inference efficiency is becoming more crucial for practical
deployment. Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when
cooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a
straightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key
challenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level
fundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level
discriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we
propose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively
decouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative
ability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a
lightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional
decomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order
statistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance
their discriminative ability. To reasonably train our multi-predictor
architecture, a decoupled optimization is proposed to allocate two-phase loss
weights for multi-stage predictors during model tuning, where the initial
training phase enables the model to prioritize the acquisition of
discriminative ability of deep stages via emphasizing representative ability of
early stages, and the latter training phase drives discriminative ability
towards earlier stages as much as possible. As such, our DMPO can effectively
decouple representative and discriminative abilities in early stages in terms
of architecture design and model optimization. Experiments across various
datasets and pre-trained backbones demonstrate that DMPO clearly outperforms
its counterparts when reducing computational cost.

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了回顾性影像的用途，为医学影像数据集设计提供了新工具。

Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has the potential to revolutionize image acquisition and
interpretation across medicine, however, attention to data imbalance and
missingness is required. Ultrasound data presents a particular challenge
because in addition to different views and structures, it includes several
sub-modalities-such as greyscale and color flow doppler (CFD)-that are often
imbalanced in clinical studies. Image translation can help balance datasets but
is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a
generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on
54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise,
adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for
reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic
ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground
truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real
ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded
clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice
score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician
accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%),
indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos,
the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average
SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities. Together, these data
expand the utility of retrospectively collected imaging and augment the dataset
design toolbox for medical imaging.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning
architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to
achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning
under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose
a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation.
Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range
reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers,
simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic
abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending
state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: IEC3D-AD数据集和GMANet方法为工业设备组件的3D异常检测提供了更精确的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection (3D-AD) plays a critical role in industrial
manufacturing, particularly in ensuring the reliability and safety of core
equipment components. Although existing 3D datasets like Real3D-AD and MVTec
3D-AD offer broad application support, they fall short in capturing the
complexities and subtle defects found in real industrial environments. This
limitation hampers precise anomaly detection research, especially for
industrial equipment components (IEC) such as bearings, rings, and bolts. To
address this challenge, we have developed a point cloud anomaly detection
dataset (IEC3D-AD) specific to real industrial scenarios. This dataset is
directly collected from actual production lines, ensuring high fidelity and
relevance. Compared to existing datasets, IEC3D-AD features significantly
improved point cloud resolution and defect annotation granularity, facilitating
more demanding anomaly detection tasks. Furthermore, inspired by generative
2D-AD methods, we introduce a novel 3D-AD paradigm (GMANet) on IEC3D-AD. This
paradigm generates synthetic point cloud samples based on geometric
morphological analysis, then reduces the margin and increases the overlap
between normal and abnormal point-level features through spatial discrepancy
optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
on both IEC3D-AD and other datasets.

Abstract: Generating long videos remains a fundamental challenge, and achieving high
controllability in video inpainting and outpainting is particularly demanding.
To address both of these challenges simultaneously and achieve controllable
video inpainting and outpainting for long video clips, we introduce a novel and
unified approach for long video inpainting and outpainting that extends
text-to-video diffusion models to generate arbitrarily long, spatially edited
videos with high fidelity. Our method leverages LoRA to efficiently fine-tune a
large pre-trained video diffusion model like Alibaba's Wan 2.1 for masked
region video synthesis, and employs an overlap-and-blend temporal co-denoising
strategy with high-order solvers to maintain consistency across long sequences.
In contrast to prior work that struggles with fixed-length clips or exhibits
stitching artifacts, our system enables arbitrarily long video generation and
editing without noticeable seams or drift. We validate our approach on

TL;DR: 论文提出Diffusion-SDPO方法，解决扩散模型偏好优化中的关键问题，通过自适应梯度缩放保护偏好分支，提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型偏好优化方法（如Diffusion-DPO）在扩大偏好边界时可能导致生成质量下降，需改进。

Method: 提出Diffusion-SDPO，通过自适应缩放失败分支梯度，确保偏好分支误差不增加。

Result: 在文本到图像基准测试中，Diffusion-SDPO在偏好、美学和提示对齐指标上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: Diffusion-SDPO是一种简单、通用的方法，有效提升扩散模型偏好优化效果。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models deliver high-quality images, yet aligning them
with human preferences remains challenging. We revisit diffusion-based Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) for these models and identify a critical
pathology: enlarging the preference margin does not necessarily improve
generation quality. In particular, the standard Diffusion-DPO objective can
increase the reconstruction error of both winner and loser branches.
Consequently, degradation of the less-preferred outputs can become sufficiently
severe that the preferred branch is also adversely affected even as the margin
grows. To address this, we introduce Diffusion-SDPO, a safeguarded update rule
that preserves the winner by adaptively scaling the loser gradient according to
its alignment with the winner gradient. A first-order analysis yields a
closed-form scaling coefficient that guarantees the error of the preferred
output is non-increasing at each optimization step. Our method is simple,
model-agnostic, broadly compatible with existing DPO-style alignment frameworks
and adds only marginal computational overhead. Across standard text-to-image
benchmarks, Diffusion-SDPO delivers consistent gains over preference-learning
baselines on automated preference, aesthetic, and prompt alignment metrics.

TL;DR: SurgViVQA是一种手术视频问答模型，通过融合视频和问题特征捕捉动态场景，显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法局限于静态图像特征，缺乏对动态手术场景的理解。

Method: 使用Masked Video--Text Encoder融合视频和问题特征，结合LLM解码答案。

Result: 在REAL-Colon-VQA和EndoVis18-VQA数据集上表现优于基准模型，关键词准确率提升显著。

Conclusion: SurgViVQA为手术视频问答提供了动态理解的框架，提升了模型对动态场景的解析能力。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VideoQA) in the surgical domain aims to enhance
intraoperative understanding by enabling AI models to reason over temporally
coherent events rather than isolated frames. Current approaches are limited to
static image features, and available datasets often lack temporal annotations,
ignoring the dynamics critical for accurate procedural interpretation. We
propose SurgViVQA, a surgical VideoQA model that extends visual reasoning from
static images to dynamic surgical scenes. It uses a Masked Video--Text Encoder
to fuse video and question features, capturing temporal cues such as motion and
tool--tissue interactions, which a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) then
decodes into coherent answers. To evaluate its performance, we curated
REAL-Colon-VQA, a colonoscopic video dataset that includes motion-related
questions and diagnostic attributes, as well as out-of-template questions with
rephrased or semantically altered formulations to assess model robustness.
Experimental validation on REAL-Colon-VQA and the public EndoVis18-VQA dataset
shows that SurgViVQA outperforms existing image-based VQA benchmark models,
particularly in keyword accuracy, improving over PitVQA by +11\% on
REAL-Colon-VQA and +9\% on EndoVis18-VQA. A perturbation study on the questions
further confirms improved generalizability and robustness to variations in
question phrasing. SurgViVQA and the REAL-Colon-VQA dataset provide a framework
for temporally-aware understanding in surgical VideoQA, enabling AI models to
interpret dynamic procedural contexts more effectively. Code and dataset

TL;DR: UniAVGen是一个统一的音频-视频生成框架，通过双分支联合合成架构和跨模态交互机制，显著提升了唇部同步和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源音频-视频生成方法在跨模态建模上效果不佳，导致唇部同步和语义一致性不足。

Method: 采用双分支Diffusion Transformers构建跨模态潜在空间，结合非对称跨模态交互机制和面部感知调制模块，并引入模态感知的无分类器引导策略。

Result: UniAVGen在较少训练样本（1.3M vs. 30.1M）下，在音频-视频同步、音色一致性和情感一致性上表现优越。

Conclusion: UniAVGen通过统一框架实现了多种音频-视频任务的联合生成，显著提升了跨模态生成的质量和效率。

Abstract: Due to the lack of effective cross-modal modeling, existing open-source
audio-video generation methods often exhibit compromised lip synchronization
and insufficient semantic consistency. To mitigate these drawbacks, we propose
UniAVGen, a unified framework for joint audio and video generation. UniAVGen is
anchored in a dual-branch joint synthesis architecture, incorporating two
parallel Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to build a cohesive cross-modal latent
space. At its heart lies an Asymmetric Cross-Modal Interaction mechanism, which
enables bidirectional, temporally aligned cross-attention, thus ensuring
precise spatiotemporal synchronization and semantic consistency. Furthermore,
this cross-modal interaction is augmented by a Face-Aware Modulation module,
which dynamically prioritizes salient regions in the interaction process. To
enhance generative fidelity during inference, we additionally introduce
Modality-Aware Classifier-Free Guidance, a novel strategy that explicitly
amplifies cross-modal correlation signals. Notably, UniAVGen's robust joint
synthesis design enables seamless unification of pivotal audio-video tasks
within a single model, such as joint audio-video generation and continuation,
video-to-audio dubbing, and audio-driven video synthesis. Comprehensive
experiments validate that, with far fewer training samples (1.3M vs. 30.1M),
UniAVGen delivers overall advantages in audio-video synchronization, timbre
consistency, and emotion consistency.

Motivation: 现有提示学习方法在未见类别上泛化能力不足，且缺乏对语义视觉特征的明确指导。

Method: 引入AAPL方法，利用图像级增强和对抗性标记嵌入解耦视觉变化与语义表示。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，AAPL在少样本、零样本、跨数据集和领域泛化设置中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AAPL通过增强和对抗性嵌入有效提升提示学习的泛化能力，尤其在语义视觉特征学习方面表现突出。

Abstract: Recent advances in large-scale vision and language models have led to
significant progress in zero-shot learning tasks. Methods such as CoOp and
CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,
known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these
models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While
traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data
augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based
modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely
unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,
particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support
and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between
these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to
improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such
as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that
focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose
Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces
adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations
introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This
decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually
discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently
outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and
domain generalization settings. Our source code is publicly available at:

Motivation: 标准化胚胎对齐有助于产前生长监测，提高标准平面检测和标志物可视化的效果。

Method: 使用PCA提取胚胎主轴，生成四个候选方向，并通过三种策略（启发式、图谱匹配、随机森林）选择标准方向。

Result: 在2166张图像中，PCA正确提取主轴的准确率为99.0%，三种策略的准确率分别为97.4%、95.8%和98.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法在孕早期实现了高精度的胚胎对齐，适用于临床和研究场景，代码已开源。

Abstract: Standardized alignment of the embryo in three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound
images aids prenatal growth monitoring by facilitating standard plane
detection, improving visualization of landmarks and accentuating differences
between different scans. In this work, we propose an automated method for
standardizing this alignment. Given a segmentation mask of the embryo,
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the mask extracting the
embryo's principal axes, from which four candidate orientations are derived.
The candidate in standard orientation is selected using one of three
strategies: a heuristic based on Pearson's correlation assessing shape, image
matching to an atlas through normalized cross-correlation, and a Random Forest
classifier. We tested our method on 2166 images longitudinally acquired 3D
ultrasound scans from 1043 pregnancies from the Rotterdam Periconceptional
Cohort, ranging from 7+0 to 12+6 weeks of gestational age. In 99.0% of images,
PCA correctly extracted the principal axes of the embryo. The correct candidate
was selected by the Pearson Heuristic, Atlas-based and Random Forest in 97.4%,
95.8%, and 98.4% of images, respectively. A Majority Vote of these selection
methods resulted in an accuracy of 98.5%. The high accuracy of this pipeline
enables consistent embryonic alignment in the first trimester, enabling
scalable analysis in both clinical and research settings. The code is publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SfT方法在拓扑变化时失效，需要一种能处理撕裂、切割等拓扑事件的方法。

Method: 初始化经典SfT解，迭代分区模板空间域，优化能量函数（物理合理性和重投影一致性）。

Result: 在合成和真实数据上均优于基线方法，能处理多种拓扑事件。

Conclusion: 首次建立了处理拓扑变化的SfT通用框架，实验验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Reconstructing the surfaces of deformable objects from correspondences
between a 3D template and a 2D image is well studied under Shape-from-Template
(SfT) methods; however, existing approaches break down when topological changes
accompany the deformation. We propose a principled extension of SfT that
enables reconstruction in the presence of such changes. Our approach is
initialized with a classical SfT solution and iteratively adapts the template
by partitioning its spatial domain so as to minimize an energy functional that
jointly encodes physical plausibility and reprojection consistency. We
demonstrate that the method robustly captures a wide range of practically
relevant topological events including tears and cuts on bounded 2D surfaces,
thereby establishing the first general framework for topological-change-aware
SfT. Experiments on both synthetic and real data confirm that our approach
consistently outperforms baseline methods.

TL;DR: Anny是一个基于人体测量学的开源、可微分的人体模型，无需3D扫描，支持广泛的人口统计学特征和语义控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体模型依赖昂贵的3D扫描和专有数据，且人口统计学覆盖有限，Anny旨在提供一个开放、多样且易于访问的替代方案。

Method: Anny利用MakeHuman社区的人体测量学知识，定义了一个连续、可解释的形状空间，通过表型参数（如性别、年龄、身高、体重）控制混合形状。

Result: Anny支持毫米级扫描拟合、合成数据生成和人体网格恢复（HMR），其性能与基于扫描的模型相当。

Conclusion: Anny是一个开放、多功能的人体建模基础工具，适用于广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: Parametric body models are central to many human-centric tasks, yet existing
models often rely on costly 3D scans and learned shape spaces that are
proprietary and demographically narrow. We introduce Anny, a simple, fully
differentiable, and scan-free human body model grounded in anthropometric
knowledge from the MakeHuman community. Anny defines a continuous,
interpretable shape space, where phenotype parameters (e.g. gender, age,
height, weight) control blendshapes spanning a wide range of human forms --
across ages (from infants to elders), body types, and proportions. Calibrated
using WHO population statistics, it provides realistic and demographically
grounded human shape variation within a single unified model. Thanks to its
openness and semantic control, Anny serves as a versatile foundation for 3D
human modeling -- supporting millimeter-accurate scan fitting, controlled
synthetic data generation, and Human Mesh Recovery (HMR). We further introduce
Anny-One, a collection of 800k photorealistic humans generated with Anny,
showing that despite its simplicity, HMR models trained with Anny can match the
performance of those trained with scan-based body models, while remaining
interpretable and broadly representative. The Anny body model and its code are
released under the Apache 2.0 license, making Anny an accessible foundation for
human-centric 3D modeling.

TL;DR: 提出了一种信号强度加权的坐标表示方法，替代纯坐标通道，提高了生物医学信号定位任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物医学数据中的定位任务需要模型从复杂强度分布的信号中学习空间或时间关系，现有方法如CoordConv层通过附加坐标通道学习绝对位置，但缺乏对信号强度的考虑。

Method: 提出信号强度加权的坐标表示，将纯坐标通道替换为局部信号强度加权的通道，直接在输入表示中嵌入强度-位置耦合。

Result: 在ECG信号和细胞学图像上的实验表明，该方法比传统坐标通道方法收敛更快且泛化性能更高。

Conclusion: 信号强度加权的坐标表示是一种简单且模态无关的归纳偏置，适用于一维和二维生物医学信号的定位任务。

Abstract: Localisation tasks in biomedical data often require models to learn
meaningful spatial or temporal relationships from signals with complex
intensity distributions. A common strategy, exemplified by CoordConv layers, is
to append coordinate channels to convolutional inputs, enabling networks to
learn absolute positions. In this work, we propose a signal intensity-weighted
coordinate representation that replaces the pure coordinate channels with
channels scaled by local signal intensity. This modification embeds an
intensity-position coupling directly in the input representation, introducing a
simple and modality-agnostic inductive bias. We evaluate the approach on two
distinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological
transition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the
coordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.
In both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher
generalisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel
approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and
two-dimensional biomedical signals.

Abstract: This paper presents a lightweight three-dimensional convolutional neural
network (3DCNN) for human activity recognition (HAR) using event-based vision
data. Privacy preservation is a key challenge in human monitoring systems, as
conventional frame-based cameras capture identifiable personal information. In
contrast, event cameras record only changes in pixel intensity, providing an
inherently privacy-preserving sensing modality. The proposed network
effectively models both spatial and temporal dynamics while maintaining a
compact design suitable for edge deployment. To address class imbalance and
enhance generalization, focal loss with class reweighting and targeted data
augmentation strategies are employed. The model is trained and evaluated on a
composite dataset derived from the Toyota Smart Home and ETRI datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate an F1-score of 0.9415 and an overall accuracy
of 94.17%, outperforming benchmark 3D-CNN architectures such as C3D, ResNet3D,
and MC3_18 by up to 3%. These results highlight the potential of event-based
deep learning for developing accurate, efficient, and privacy-aware human

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于身体部位特征的细粒度社交互动检测方法，通过局部感知和自底向上的推理框架，显著提升了社交群体检测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽略了细微的社交线索（如面部表情、视线和手势），且直接检测社交群体而未建模个体间的互动，导致局部社交信号捕捉不足和群体配置推断模糊。

Method: 提出局部感知的自底向上推理框架，通过身体部位特征和人际关系的建模，先检测个体并增强其特征，再通过相似性推理关联个体以推断群体配置。

Result: 在NVI数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有方法，达到了新的最优性能。

Conclusion: 通过局部感知和细粒度推理，该方法能更准确地捕捉社交互动信号，提升群体检测效果。

Abstract: Social interactions often emerge from subtle, fine-grained cues such as
facial expressions, gaze, and gestures. However, existing methods for social
interaction detection overlook such nuanced cues and primarily rely on holistic
representations of individuals. Moreover, they directly detect social groups
without explicitly modeling the underlying interactions between individuals.
These drawbacks limit their ability to capture localized social signals and
introduce ambiguity when group configurations should be inferred from social
interactions grounded in nuanced cues. In this work, we propose a part-aware
bottom-up group reasoning framework for fine-grained social interaction
detection. The proposed method infers social groups and their interactions
using body part features and their interpersonal relations. Our model first
detects individuals and enhances their features using part-aware cues, and then
infers group configuration by associating individuals via similarity-based
reasoning, which considers not only spatial relations but also subtle social
cues that signal interactions, leading to more accurate group inference.
Experiments on the NVI dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms prior
methods, achieving the new state of the art.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法清晰区分运动和空间上下文对预测的影响，且语言方法难以解释隐含的运动。

Method: 提出DANCE框架，通过运动动态、对象和场景概念解耦预测，利用大语言模型自动提取概念。

Result: 在四个数据集上验证，DANCE显著提升解释清晰度且性能竞争，用户研究证实其优越可解释性。

Conclusion: DANCE不仅提升解释性，还支持模型调试、编辑和失败分析。

Abstract: Effective explanations of video action recognition models should disentangle
how movements unfold over time from the surrounding spatial context. However,
existing methods based on saliency produce entangled explanations, making it
unclear whether predictions rely on motion or spatial context. Language-based
approaches offer structure but often fail to explain motions due to their tacit
nature -- intuitively understood but difficult to verbalize. To address these
challenges, we propose Disentangled Action aNd Context concept-based
Explainable (DANCE) video action recognition, a framework that predicts actions
through disentangled concept types: motion dynamics, objects, and scenes. We
define motion dynamics concepts as human pose sequences. We employ a large
language model to automatically extract object and scene concepts. Built on an
ante-hoc concept bottleneck design, DANCE enforces prediction through these
concepts. Experiments on four datasets -- KTH, Penn Action, HAA500, and UCF-101
-- demonstrate that DANCE significantly improves explanation clarity with
competitive performance. We validate the superior interpretability of DANCE
through a user study. Experimental results also show that DANCE is beneficial
for model debugging, editing, and failure analysis.

TL;DR: FATE（Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation）是一个新的形式代数基准系列，旨在填补大型语言模型（LLM）在高级数学推理中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在竞赛数学中表现优异，但未能反映现代数学研究的深度和广度，因此需要更复杂的基准。

Method: 引入FATE-H和FATE-X两个新组件，各包含100个抽象代数和交换代数问题，难度从本科到博士资格考试以上。

Result: 最佳LLM在FATE-H上仅3%准确率（pass@64），FATE-X上为0%，且自然语言推理优于形式化能力。

Conclusion: FATE为研究级形式数学推理提供了具有挑战性的基准，揭示了LLM在高级数学中的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based
mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect
the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge
this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new
benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced
mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each
with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a
difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD
qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both
PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our
evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a
stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%
(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals
that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their
ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common
errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative
study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection
than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language
stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that
establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal
mathematical reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有组推荐系统大多假设静态或预定义组，无法适应动态现实场景，因此需要解决组形成这一核心挑战。

Method: 采用轻量级GCN架构捕捉高阶用户信息，结合随机聚类学习和对比学习实现实时组形成和动态调整。

Result: 在多个数据集上，DeepForm在组形成质量、效率和推荐准确性上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DeepForm为动态组推荐提供了高效且灵活的解决方案，显著提升了实际应用中的表现。

Abstract: While prior work on group recommender systems (GRSs) has primarily focused on
improving recommendation accuracy, most approaches assume static or predefined
groups, making them unsuitable for dynamic, real-world scenarios. We reframe
group formation as a core challenge in GRSs and propose DeepForm (Stochastic
Deep Graph Clustering for Practical Group Formation), a framework designed to
meet three key operational requirements: (1) the incorporation of high-order
user information, (2) real-time group formation, and (3) dynamic adjustment of
the number of groups. DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that
effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning
enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive
learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple
datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality,
efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.

Motivation: 解决传统方法在ARC竞赛中计算资源超限的问题，探索高效微调小模型的可行性。

Method: 预训练7M参数递归模型于公开ARC任务，再在竞赛允许计算限制内微调。

Result: 预训练模型在公开评估集得10%分，微调后在半私有任务达6.67%。

Conclusion: 小模型通过预训练和全微调可在有限计算下有效提升竞赛表现。

Abstract: Prior to the close of the 2025 ARC Prize competition, the leading open source
approach - known as TRM, or Tiny Recursive Models - involved training a 7M
parameter recursive neural network on augmented variants of ARC tasks. That
approach scored approximately 7.8% on the public ARC AGI II evaluation set, but
required a level of compute far in excess of what is allowed during the
competition. This paper shows that, by starting from a tiny recursive model
that has been pre-trained on public ARC tasks, one can efficiently fine-tune on
competition tasks within the allowed compute limits. Specifically, a model was
pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on
4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model
was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to
reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such
post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model,
not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.

Abstract: The North Indian Ocean, including the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal,
represents a vital source of livelihood for coastal communities, yet fishermen
often face uncertainty in locating productive fishing grounds. To address this
challenge, we present an AI-assisted framework for predicting Potential Fishing

PFZ identification and provide region-specific insights for sustainable fishing
practices. Preliminary results indicate that the framework can support
fishermen by reducing search time, lowering fuel consumption, and promoting
efficient resource utilization.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用大语言模型（LLM）进行零样本、单样本和少样本学习的新型框架，用于检测和净化人类活动识别（HAR）系统中的数据中毒攻击，减少对大规模标注数据的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可穿戴设备在物联网（IoT）中的广泛应用，数据中毒攻击威胁了HAR系统的数据完整性和可靠性，而传统防御方法需要大量标注数据，适应性不足。

Method: 采用LLM，通过“角色扮演”提示和“逐步思考”推理，检测传感器数据中的异常并生成干净的替代数据。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在检测准确性、净化质量、延迟和通信成本方面表现优异，提升了可穿戴IoT系统的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: LLM为动态IoT环境中的HAR系统提供了一种高效、适应性强的防御机制。

Abstract: The widespread integration of wearable sensing devices in Internet of Things
(IoT) ecosystems, particularly in healthcare, smart homes, and industrial
applications, has required robust human activity recognition (HAR) techniques
to improve functionality and user experience. Although machine learning models
have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks
that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems.
Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require
extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits
adaptability in dynamic IoT environments. This work proposes a novel framework
that uses large language models (LLMs) to perform poisoning detection and
sanitization in HAR systems, utilizing zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot
learning paradigms. Our approach incorporates \textit{role play} prompting,
whereby the LLM assumes the role of expert to contextualize and evaluate sensor
anomalies, and \textit{think step-by-step} reasoning, guiding the LLM to infer
poisoning indicators in the raw sensor data and plausible clean alternatives.
These strategies minimize reliance on curation of extensive datasets and enable
robust, adaptable defense mechanisms in real-time. We perform an extensive
evaluation of the framework, quantifying detection accuracy, sanitization
quality, latency, and communication cost, thus demonstrating the practicality
and effectiveness of LLMs in improving the security and reliability of wearable
IoT systems.

Abstract: Efforts have increased in recent years to identify associations between
specific datasets and the scientific literature that incorporates them. Knowing
that a given publication cites a given dataset, the next logical step is to
explore how or why that data was used. Advances in recent years with
pretrained, transformer-based large language models (LLMs) offer potential
means for scaling the description of data use cases in the published
literature. This avoids expensive manual labeling and the development of
training datasets for classical machine-learning (ML) systems. In this work we
apply an open-source LLM, Llama 3.1-405B, to generate structured data use case
labels for publications known to incorporate specific genomic datasets. We also
introduce a novel evaluation framework for determining the efficacy of our
methods. Our results demonstrate that the stock model can achieve an F1 score
of .674 on a zero-shot data citation classification task with no previously
defined categories. While promising, our results are qualified by barriers
related to data availability, prompt overfitting, computational infrastructure,
and the expense required to conduct responsible performance evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策者面临奖励未知且随时间变化的挑战，特别是在行为健康干预等场景中，现有算法可能因过度强调利用而缺乏足够探索。

Method: 开发了ROGUE-TS（基于Thompson Sampling的算法），并引入概率剪裁程序以平衡个性化与群体学习。

Result: 在两项MRT数据集上的验证显示，ROGUE-TS实现了更低遗憾值，并通过剪裁程序保持了高统计功效。

Conclusion: 该框架为MRT设计者提供了平衡个性化与统计有效性的实用指导，同时可靠地检测治疗效果。

Abstract: A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are
unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated
use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may
restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or
Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world
settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can
compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not
provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting
the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of
particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in
developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level
effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In
this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored
to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret.
We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization
and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret
and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning
physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our
methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high
statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly
increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while
accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs,
our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with
statistical validity.

Conclusion: DT-GNN框架为主动、智能和可持续的路面管理奠定了基础，未来可扩展至实际部署和多智能体协调。

Abstract: Pavement infrastructure monitoring is challenged by complex spatial
dependencies, changing environmental conditions, and non-linear deterioration
across road networks. Traditional Pavement Management Systems (PMS) remain
largely reactive, lacking real-time intelligence for failure prevention and
optimal maintenance planning. To address this, we propose a unified Digital
Twin (DT) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework for scalable, data-driven
pavement health monitoring and predictive maintenance. Pavement segments and
spatial relations are modeled as graph nodes and edges, while real-time UAV,
sensor, and LiDAR data stream into the DT. The inductive GNN learns
deterioration patterns from graph-structured inputs to forecast distress and
enable proactive interventions. Trained on a real-world-inspired dataset with
segment attributes and dynamic connectivity, our model achieves an R2 of
0.3798, outperforming baseline regressors and effectively capturing non-linear
degradation. We also develop an interactive dashboard and reinforcement
learning module for simulation, visualization, and adaptive maintenance
planning. This DT-GNN integration enhances forecasting precision and
establishes a closed feedback loop for continuous improvement, positioning the
approach as a foundation for proactive, intelligent, and sustainable pavement
management, with future extensions toward real-world deployment, multi-agent
coordination, and smart-city integration.

Conclusion: UserAlign通过少量查询高效捕捉用户偏好，适用于多种个性化生成任务。

Abstract: We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's
preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for
personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user
preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a
text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized
alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few
queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on
the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and
selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated
responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and
noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the
best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving
personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign
in achieving personalized alignment.

Result: 在复杂稀疏奖励的Atari游戏中表现更优，且无需额外超参数。

Conclusion: 新算法有效提升了探索效率，并充分利用了网络初始化的不确定性。

Abstract: Efficient exploration in deep reinforcement learning remains a fundamental
challenge, especially in environments characterized by high-dimensional states
and sparse rewards. Traditional exploration strategies that rely on random
local policy noise, such as $\epsilon$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration
methods, often struggle to efficiently balance exploration and exploitation. In
this paper, we integrate the notion of (expected) value of information (EVOI)
within the well-known Bootstrapped DQN algorithmic framework, to enhance the
algorithm's deep exploration ability. Specifically, we develop two novel
algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of
information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information
estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network
heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential. We evaluate
our algorithms with respect to performance and their ability to exploit
inherent uncertainty arising from random network initialization. Our
experiments in complex, sparse-reward Atari games demonstrate increased
performance, all the while making better use of uncertainty, and, importantly,
without introducing extra hyperparameters.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了异质超材料设计中的兼容性和分辨率问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Metamaterials are engineered materials composed of specially designed unit
cells that exhibit extraordinary properties beyond those of natural materials.
Complex engineering tasks often require heterogeneous unit cells to accommodate
spatially varying property requirements. However, designing heterogeneous
metamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and
strict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional
concurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization
problem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell
boundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures
from a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require
additional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we
propose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a
continuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly
addressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural
representation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and
local (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that
represents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across
the domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility
loss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.
Once trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high
resolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical
metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems
with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.

Conclusion: GraphBSI通过贝叶斯推断和SDE框架有效处理离散图结构，并在实验中展示了优越性能。

Abstract: Generating graph-structured data is crucial in applications such as molecular
generation, knowledge graphs, and network analysis. However, their discrete,
unordered nature makes them difficult for traditional generative models,
leading to the rise of discrete diffusion and flow matching models. In this
work, we introduce GraphBSI, a novel one-shot graph generative model based on
Bayesian Sample Inference (BSI). Instead of evolving samples directly, GraphBSI
iteratively refines a belief over graphs in the continuous space of
distribution parameters, naturally handling discrete structures. Further, we
state BSI as a stochastic differential equation (SDE) and derive a
noise-controlled family of SDEs that preserves the marginal distributions via
an approximation of the score function. Our theoretical analysis further
reveals the connection to Bayesian Flow Networks and Diffusion models. Finally,
in our empirical evaluation, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on
molecular and synthetic graph generation, outperforming existing one-shot graph
generative models on the standard benchmarks Moses and GuacaMol.

Abstract: Monitoring the internal temperature and humidity of shipping containers is
essential to preventing quality degradation during cargo transportation.
Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal
conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an
alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate
telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the
predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users.
In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework
for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live
telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless''
monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48
million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever
used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements
over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the
simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\sim$
2.31$^\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\sim$
7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root
mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\sim$ 3.26$^\circ$C for temperature (vs
3.38$^\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs
10.0% by sensorless). Adaptive-sensorless models enable more accurate cargo
monitoring, early risk detection, and less dependence on full connectivity in
global shipping.

Result: DADO能够更高效地利用设计变量的可分解性结构进行优化。

Conclusion: DADO为离散设计空间的优化提供了更高效的工具，适用于科学和工程应用。

Abstract: In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design
discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example,
we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a
circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a
property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a
generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to
concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization
-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as
reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that
maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over
discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial
nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific
applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over
design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective
optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may
only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve
maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are
unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and
demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,
Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any
decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make
optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized
"search distribution" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation
of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization
across linked factors.

Abstract: Recent work in financial machine learning has shown the virtue of complexity:
the phenomenon by which deep learning methods capable of learning highly

While transformer architectures like Informer have shown promise for financial

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have seen increasing popularity in enterprise
applications where AI agents and humans engage in objective-driven
interactions. However, these systems are difficult to evaluate: data may be
complex and unlabeled; human annotation is often impractical at scale; custom
metrics can monitor for specific errors, but not previously-undetected ones;
and LLM judges can produce unreliable results. We introduce the first set of
unsupervised metrics for objective-driven interactions, leveraging statistical
properties of unlabeled interaction data and using fine-tuned LLMs to adapt to
distributional shifts. We develop metrics for labeling user goals, measuring
goal completion, and quantifying LLM uncertainty without grounding evaluations
in human-generated ideal responses. Our approach is validated on open-domain
and task-specific interaction data.

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for understanding Transformer-based language
models, drawing an explicit analogy to General Relativity. Queries and keys
induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a
discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across
tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token
representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the
role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in
parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not
traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps
should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.
To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence
and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a
full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and
layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat
angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality
or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe
deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,
meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm
attention-induced curvature.

Abstract: For far too long, expressivity of graph neural networks has been measured
\emph{only} in terms of combinatorial properties. In this work we stray away
from this tradition and provide a principled way to measure similarity between
vertex attributed graphs. We denote this measure as the \emph{graph
homomorphism distortion}. We show it can \emph{completely characterize} graphs
and thus is also a \emph{complete graph embedding}. However, somewhere along
the road, we run into the graph canonization problem. To circumvent this
obstacle, we devise to efficiently compute this measure via sampling, which in
expectation ensures \emph{completeness}. Additionally, we also discovered that
we can obtain a metric from this measure. We validate our claims empirically
and find that the \emph{graph homomorphism distortion}: (1.) fully
distinguishes the \texttt{BREC} dataset with up to $4$-WL non-distinguishable
graphs, and (2.) \emph{outperforms} previous methods inspired in homomorphisms
under the \texttt{ZINC-12k} dataset.
  These theoretical results, (and their empirical validation), pave the way for
future characterization of graphs, extending the graph theoretic tradition to

Method: 提出MSUCB算法，采用新颖的中位数均值估计器，在无污染时表现如标准均值，有污染时过滤异常值。

Conclusion: MSUCB在保持强鲁棒性的同时显著提升性能，实验显示对两种先进方法的遗憾改进分别达97.35%和91.60%。

Abstract: Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list
of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks.
This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is
to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the
presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are
vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where
bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning
process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust
algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our
knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time.
This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no
cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out
outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value.
Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence
in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence
of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing
only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and
extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong
robustness. In particular, it achieves a \(97.35\%\) and a \(91.60\%\) regret
improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于稀疏、局部性和竞争原则的自组织局部核方法（SparKer），用于在缺乏先验信息的情况下检测异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人工智能虽然能提取丰富的数据表示，但其统计特性难以控制，导致异常检测方法容易失效，尤其是对弱或罕见信号的检测。

Method: 提出SparKer方法，通过稀疏高斯核集合在半监督Neyman-Pearson框架下建模局部似然比，以检测异常。

Result: 实验表明，仅需少量核即可在高维表示空间中识别显著异常，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法在科学发现、入侵检测等领域表现出色，兼具可解释性和实用性。

Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich
and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the
statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled,
causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare
signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data,
creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine
this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods
operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony;
locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote
efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of
self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation
space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these
principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained
within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the
likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal,
anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms
that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional
problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion
detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the
natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing
only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous
locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring
both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: DiCoDe是一种可扩展且高效的代理-环境协同设计框架，通过Projected Universal Guidance和critic distillation机制，显著提升了多代理系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前协同设计方法在高维环境设计空间中难以扩展且样本效率低，DiCoDe旨在解决这些问题。

Method: DiCoDe结合了Projected Universal Guidance（PUG）采样技术和critic distillation机制，优化环境设计和代理策略。

Result: 在仓库自动化、多代理路径规划和风电场优化等任务中，DiCoDe表现优异，例如在仓库任务中奖励提升39%，样本减少66%。

Conclusion: DiCoDe为代理-环境协同设计设立了新标准，为实际应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and
environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With
application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management,
co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems.
However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under
high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency
when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these
challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and
sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically
relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we
introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables
DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while
satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.
Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the
reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts
to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.
Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when
validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including
warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our
method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%
higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This
sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone
towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.

Motivation: 当前的无监督技能发现方法忽视了技能的周期性，而许多机器人任务（如运动）需要周期性行为。

Method: PSD训练编码器将状态映射到圆形潜在空间，捕捉时间距离以学习不同周期的技能。

Result: PSD在复杂任务中有效学习周期性技能，并在下游任务（如跨栏）中表现优异，与其他方法结合可增加行为多样性。

Conclusion: PSD通过编码周期性，提升了无监督技能发现的多样性和实用性。

Abstract: Unsupervised skill discovery in reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn
diverse behaviors without relying on external rewards. However, current methods
often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on
increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the
distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks --
particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across
varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is
essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a
framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key
idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space,
thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By
capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse
periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We
further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream
tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill
discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's
repertoire. Our code and demos are available at

Abstract: The uprising of deep learning methodology and practice in recent years has
brought about a severe consequence of increasing carbon footprint due to the
insatiable demand for computational resources and power. The field of text
analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of
monopolizing methodology. In this paper, the original TF-IDF algorithm has been
modified, and Clement Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (CTF-IDF) has
been proposed for data preprocessing. This paper primarily discusses the
effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with
CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The
introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics
pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive
application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon
footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also
exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model
accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this
paper.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播需要两次传递和存储中间激活值，现有前向模式自动微分方法因高方差难以扩展。

Result: 方法在网络宽度增加时表现更好，展示了扩展潜力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过分析偏差、方差及其与神经网络梯度低维结构的联系，为梯度估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: While backpropagation--reverse-mode automatic differentiation--has been
extraordinarily successful in deep learning, it requires two passes (forward
and backward) through the neural network and the storage of intermediate
activations. Existing gradient estimation methods that instead use forward-mode
automatic differentiation struggle to scale beyond small networks due to the
high variance of the estimates. Efforts to mitigate this have so far introduced
significant bias to the estimates, reducing their utility. We introduce a
gradient estimation approach that reduces both bias and variance by
manipulating upstream Jacobian matrices when computing guess directions. It
shows promising results and has the potential to scale to larger networks,
indeed performing better as the network width is increased. Our understanding
of this method is facilitated by analyses of bias and variance, and their
connection to the low-dimensional structure of neural network gradients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体生成模型存在物理不一致性和泛化能力不足的问题，FP-AbDiff旨在通过物理约束解决这些问题。

Method: FP-AbDiff在SE(3)-等变扩散框架中引入FPE残差损失，强制局部去噪分数形成全局一致的概率流。

Result: 在RAbD基准测试中，FP-AbDiff在CDR-H3设计中实现了0.99 Å的RMSD和39.91%的CAAR，六-CDR协同设计中表现更优。

Conclusion: FP-AbDiff通过物理约束提升了抗体设计的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为功能性抗体设计提供了新方法。

Abstract: Computational antibody design holds immense promise for therapeutic
discovery, yet existing generative models are fundamentally limited by two core
challenges: (i) a lack of dynamical consistency, which yields physically
implausible structures, and (ii) poor generalization due to data scarcity and
structural bias. We introduce FP-AbDiff, the first antibody generator to
enforce Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE) physics along the entire generative
trajectory. Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed
manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising
scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This
physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological
priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework.
Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a
new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean
Square Deviation of 0.99 {\AA} when superposing on the variable region, a 25%
improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest
reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored
in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers
consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root
Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain
Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%). By
aligning generative dynamics with physical laws, FP-AbDiff enhances robustness
and generalizability, establishing a principled approach for physically
faithful and functionally viable antibody design.

Method: 放松条件独立性假设，提出更实用的增强重叠假设，并推导出下游性能的渐近闭合边界。

Result: 提出的增强重叠理论表明，通过简单的正样本对齐，对比学习可以将类内样本聚集在一起。

Conclusion: 从增强重叠视角开发的无监督评估指标与下游性能高度一致，无需额外模块。

Abstract: Recently, self-supervised contrastive learning has achieved great success on
various tasks. However, its underlying working mechanism is yet unclear. In
this paper, we first provide the tightest bounds based on the widely adopted
assumption of conditional independence. Further, we relax the conditional
independence assumption to a more practical assumption of augmentation overlap
and derive the asymptotically closed bounds for the downstream performance. Our
proposed augmentation overlap theory hinges on the insight that the support of
different intra-class samples will become more overlapped under aggressive data
augmentations, thus simply aligning the positive samples (augmented views of
the same sample) could make contrastive learning cluster intra-class samples
together. Moreover, from the newly derived augmentation overlap perspective, we
develop an unsupervised metric for the representation evaluation of contrastive
learning, which aligns well with the downstream performance almost without
relying on additional modules. Code is available at

Conclusion: 为LLMs的自我鲁棒性评估提供了系统性方法。

Abstract: LLMs can provide substantial zero-shot performance on diverse tasks using a
simple task prompt, eliminating the need for training or fine-tuning. However,
when applying these models to sensitive tasks, it is crucial to thoroughly
assess their robustness against adversarial inputs. In this work, we introduce
Static Deceptor (StaDec) and Dynamic Deceptor (DyDec), two innovative attack
frameworks designed to systematically generate dynamic and adaptive adversarial
examples by leveraging the understanding of the LLMs. We produce subtle and
natural-looking adversarial inputs that preserve semantic similarity to the
original text while effectively deceiving the target LLM. By utilizing an
automated, LLM-driven pipeline, we eliminate the dependence on external
heuristics. Our attacks evolve with the advancements in LLMs and demonstrate
strong transferability across models unknown to the attacker. Overall, this
work provides a systematic approach for the self-assessment of an LLM's
robustness. We release our code and data at

TL;DR: AQR是一种测试时自适应技术，通过通道级别的分位数对齐改进预激活分布，无需目标域先验知识或模型重训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统域适应方法依赖目标域先验知识或需要重训练，而现有测试时适应方法难以捕捉复杂激活分布且局限于特定归一化层。

Method: 提出AQR，通过分位数对齐调整预激活分布，结合鲁棒的尾部校准策略，适用于多种归一化层。

Result: 在多个数据集和架构上，AQR表现优于现有测试时适应基线方法。

Conclusion: AQR在动态和不可预测数据分布的实际场景中具有部署潜力。

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a key strategy for enhancing the generalizability of
deep learning models in real-world scenarios, where test distributions often
diverge significantly from the training domain. However, conventional
approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require
model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or
resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on
batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but
they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained
to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration
(AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation
distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the
full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures
employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of
estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a
robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our
method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling
unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C,
CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR
achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing
test-time adaptation baselines. These results highlight AQR's potential for
deployment in real-world scenarios with dynamic and unpredictable data
distributions.

Result: 在16个数据集上，F2A表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: F2A为现实应用提供了一种可扩展的零样本异常预测解决方案。

Abstract: Forecasting anomalies (anomaly prediction) in multivariate time series from
different real-world, dynamic, and complex systems is vital for preempting
critical failures, leading to a substantial minimization in operational costs
and human labor. Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while
failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast,
pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated
strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their
potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally
different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly
(F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities
through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss
that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous
time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module
that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on
them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference
time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates.
By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap
between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction.
Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones
show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a
scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.

Conclusion: UnCLe为揭示复杂现象中随时间变化的机制提供了有前景的方法。

Abstract: Uncovering cause-effect relationships from observational time series is
fundamental to understanding complex systems. While many methods infer static
causal graphs, real-world systems often exhibit dynamic causality-where
relationships evolve over time. Accurately capturing these temporal dynamics
requires time-resolved causal graphs. We propose UnCLe, a novel deep learning
method for scalable dynamic causal discovery. UnCLe employs a pair of Uncoupler
and Recoupler networks to disentangle input time series into semantic
representations and learns inter-variable dependencies via auto-regressive
Dependency Matrices. It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing
datapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits
a unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal
causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human
motion). UnCLe offers a promising approach for revealing the underlying,
time-varying mechanisms of complex phenomena.

Conclusion: 注意力机制的有效性可能源于权重分布的平衡性，而非softmax非线性。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have been extensively employed in various applications,
including time series modeling, owing to their capacity to capture intricate
dependencies; however, their utility is often constrained by quadratic
computational complexity, which impedes scalability for long sequences. In this
work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these
limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that
entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies
that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values
exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an
efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of
dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the
implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality.
Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in
spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the
non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and
well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four
spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or
superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both
memory usage and computational time.

Result: 在MIMIC数据集上表现优于其他方法，能生成缺失模态的准确表示。

Conclusion: Copula驱动的框架有效捕捉多模态复杂交互，提升性能。

Abstract: Various data modalities are common in real-world applications (e.g.,
electronic health records, medical images and clinical notes in healthcare). It
is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various
information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to
appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a
joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the
Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities
and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the
joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is
underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the
interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution
and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel
copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the
joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions
among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align
the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a
Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint
distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing
modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available

Conclusion: 不同训练目标在不同场景下各有优势，选择合适的训练目标对降尺度任务的性能至关重要。

Abstract: Climate models are limited by heavy computational costs, often producing
outputs at coarse spatial resolutions, while many climate change impact studies
require finer scales. Statistical downscaling bridges this gap, and we adapt
the probabilistic U-Net for this task, combining a deterministic U-Net backbone
with a variational latent space to capture aleatoric uncertainty. We evaluate
four training objectives, afCRPS and WMSE-MS-SSIM with three settings for
downscaling precipitation and temperature from $16\times$ coarser resolution.
Our main finding is that WMSE-MS-SSIM performs well for extremes under certain
settings, whereas afCRPS better captures spatial variability across scales.

Result: PTQ在检测精度上表现更优，且实现了6倍加速和21倍压缩；QAT则实现了3倍加速和24倍压缩。

Conclusion: 量化策略（尤其是PTQ）在物联网僵尸网络检测中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: In an effort to counter the increasing IoT botnet-based attacks,
state-of-the-art deep learning methods have been proposed and have achieved
impressive detection accuracy. However, their computational intensity restricts
deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices, creating a critical need for
lightweight detection models. A common solution to this challenge is model
compression via quantization. This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework
where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors
derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a
pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization
strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization
(PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection
performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT
botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with
respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable
decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original
unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in
size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the
practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.

Motivation: 气候变化加剧城市洪水频率和严重性，影响生活质量，需应对不确定性和复杂性。

Result: 初步结果显示该方法优于现实和实际规划策略。

Conclusion: RL框架可有效学习适应措施，提升长期QoL，模型已开源。

Abstract: Urban flooding is expected to increase in frequency and severity as a
consequence of climate change, causing wide-ranging impacts that include a
decrease in urban Quality of Life (QoL). Meanwhile, policymakers must devise
adaptation strategies that can cope with the uncertain nature of climate change
and the complex and dynamic nature of urban flooding. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) holds significant promise in tackling such complex, dynamic, and uncertain
problems. Because of this, we use RL to identify which climate adaptation
pathways lead to a higher QoL in the long term. We do this using an Integrated
Assessment Model (IAM) which combines a rainfall projection model, a flood
model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality of life index. Our
preliminary results suggest that this approach can be used to learn optimal
adaptation measures and it outperforms other realistic and real-world planning
strategies. Our framework is publicly available:

TL;DR: FCDC是一种闭环数据收集范式，通过反馈机制动态平衡数据多样性与冗余，显著提升数据集质量并减少存储需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统受限于数据质量和多样性，传统开环数据收集方式效率低下且冗余严重，亟需改进。

Method: FCDC将数据收集建模为闭环控制问题，利用在线概率模型和反馈信号（如似然和马氏距离）动态调节样本保留。

Result: 实验表明，FCDC在真实数据流中减少39.8%存储需求的同时，数据集平衡性提升25.9%。

Conclusion: FCDC将数据收集从被动过程转变为主动调控的核心环节，为数据为中心的AI提供了新范式。

Abstract: Modern AI systems are increasingly constrained not by model capacity but by
the quality and diversity of their data. Despite growing emphasis on
data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which
accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage. This
results in inefficient storage, costly labeling, and limited generalization. To
address this, this paper introduces \ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data
collection as a closed-loop control problem. \ac{FCDC} continuously
approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online
probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on
feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this
feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and
exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from
accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \ac{FCDC} on
a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \ac{FCDC}
produces more balanced datasets by $\SI{25.9}{\percent}$ while reducing data
storage by $\SI{39.8}{\percent}$. These results demonstrate that data
collection itself can be actively controlled, transforming collection from a
passive pipeline stage into a self-regulating, feedback-driven process at the
core of data-centric AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在稀疏、噪声或高维不连续系数情况下表现不佳，IGNO旨在克服这些限制。

Method: IGNO将高维系数编码到低维潜在空间，通过PDE残差训练，利用梯度优化和归一化流加速。

Result: IGNO在多种逆问题中表现优异，尤其在噪声环境下优于现有方法，并具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: IGNO为计算科学中的逆问题提供了统一且强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
central to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements
are sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or
discontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive
labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to
failure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a
novel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome
these limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both
point measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs.
This framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient
fields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator
decoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies
purely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds
via efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a
priori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse
problems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based
measurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO
consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under
severe noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under
varying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to
out-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and
powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across
computational science domains.

Motivation: 气候变化加剧洪水频率和严重性，需明确适应政策中的规范性选择。

Method: 结合降雨和洪水模型，通过IAM评估洪水对生活质量、交通和基础设施的影响。

Result: 优先考虑生活质量的模型导致更高的适应支出和更均匀的支出分布。

Conclusion: RL和IAM框架能有效支持适应政策设计，并揭示规范性假设对政策的影响。

Abstract: Climate change will cause an increase in the frequency and severity of flood
events, prompting the need for cohesive adaptation policymaking. Designing
effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of
long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important
normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that
Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation
pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit
modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g.
economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link
together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in
terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our
results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more
adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the
study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can
alter adaptation policy. Our framework is publicly available:

Result: GMoPE在多种预训练策略和下游任务中表现优于现有方法，且适应成本低。

Conclusion: GMoPE为通用且高效的图基础模型提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on
task-specific benchmarks, yet their ability to generalize across diverse
domains and tasks remains limited. Existing approaches often struggle with
negative transfer, scalability issues, and high adaptation costs. To address
these challenges, we propose GMoPE (Graph Mixture of Prompt-Experts), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
with prompt-based learning for graphs. GMoPE leverages expert-specific prompt
vectors and structure-aware MoE routing to enable each expert to specialize in
distinct subdomains and dynamically contribute to predictions. To promote
diversity and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a soft orthogonality
constraint across prompt vectors, encouraging expert specialization and
facilitating a more balanced expert utilization. Additionally, we adopt a
prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal
complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments
under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results
show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring
only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and
scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation
models.

Motivation: 研究经典EM的内部机制，揭示其局限性（如奖励崩溃和易类偏差），并提出改进方法。

Method: 将经典EM解耦为两部分（CADF和GMC），并提出AdaDEM，通过归一化奖励和引入边际熵校准器（MEC）来优化。

Result: AdaDEM在噪声和动态环境中的不完全监督学习任务中表现优于经典EM的变体DEM*。

Conclusion: AdaDEM通过解耦和自适应校准，显著提升了熵最小化的效果，适用于多种任务。

Abstract: Entropy Minimization (EM) is beneficial to reducing class overlap, bridging
domain gap, and restricting uncertainty for various tasks in machine learning,
yet its potential is limited. To study the internal mechanism of EM, we
reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects:
cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts
a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC)
penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities.
Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled
formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty
samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment
between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we
propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the
reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to
replace GMC. AdaDEM outperforms DEM*, an upper-bound variant of classical EM,
and achieves superior performance across various imperfectly supervised
learning tasks in noisy and dynamic environments.

Motivation: 探索在数据受限情况下，扩散语言模型与自回归模型的性能差异及其原因。

Method: 通过控制预训练设置，比较DLM和AR模型在不同数据量、质量和模型规模下的表现。

Result: DLM在数据受限时表现更优，1.7B参数的DLM在10B独特Python token上超越AR模型；1B参数的DLM在少量数据下也能取得良好性能。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型在数据受限时具有优势，其性能提升源于多因素叠加，且验证交叉熵上升不意味着下游任务性能下降。

Abstract: Under strictly controlled pre-training settings, we observe a Crossover: when
unique data is limited, diffusion language models (DLMs) consistently surpass
autoregressive (AR) models by training for more epochs. The crossover shifts
later with more or higher-quality data, earlier with larger models, and
persists across dense and sparse architectures. We attribute the gains to three
compounding factors: (1) any-order modeling, (2) super-dense compute from
iterative bidirectional denoising, and (3) built-in Monte Carlo augmentation;
input or parameter noise improves AR under data constraint but cannot close the
gap. At scale, a 1.7B DLM trained with a ~1.5T-token compute budget on 10B
unique Python tokens overtakes an AR coder trained with strictly matched
settings. In addition, a 1B-parameter DLM achieves > 56% accuracy on HellaSwag
and > 33% on MMLU using only 1B tokens, without any special tricks, just by
repeating standard pre-training data. We also show that rising validation
cross-entropy does not imply degraded downstream performance in this regime.

Result: 实验显示吞吐量提升23.7%，P99延迟降低31.4%；生产部署中服务降级事件减少82%。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态环境中表现优异，显著提升了系统稳定性和服务质量。

Abstract: As cloud computing and microservice architectures become increasingly
prevalent, API rate limiting has emerged as a critical mechanism for ensuring
system stability and service quality. Traditional rate limiting algorithms,
such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to
adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes
an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that
dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid
architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage
Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a
Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states
and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction.
Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate
that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency
reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load
scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million
daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method,
with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual
interventions.

Result: 新算法在多种实验设置下实现了更低的重建误差和更高的计算效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为MRA问题提供了更直接和高效的解决方案，适用于多种实际应用场景。

Abstract: From molecular imaging to wireless communications, the ability to align and
reconstruct signals from multiple misaligned observations is crucial for system
performance. We study the problem of multi-reference alignment (MRA), which
arises in many real-world problems, such as cryo-EM, computer vision, and, in
particular, wireless communication systems. Using a probabilistic approach to
model MRA, we find a new algorithm that uses relative poses as nuisance
variables to marginalize out -- thereby removing the global symmetries of the
problem and allowing for more direct solutions and improved convergence. The
decentralization of this approach enables significant computational savings by
avoiding the cubic scaling of centralized methods through cycle consistency.
Both proposed algorithms achieve lower reconstruction error across experimental
settings.

Conclusion: 为微服务异常检测提供了新技术路径，并为分布式系统的智能运维奠定了方法论基础。

Abstract: This study addresses the problem of anomaly detection and root cause tracing
in microservice architectures and proposes a unified framework that combines
graph neural networks with temporal modeling. The microservice call chain is
abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and
edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph
convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model
dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On
this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal
evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations
are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving
the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring
functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified
modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which
enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of
potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed
from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental
disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results
show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC,
Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic
topologies and complex environments. This research not only provides a new
technical path for anomaly detection in microservices but also lays a
methodological foundation for intelligent operations in distributed systems.

Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在社会生活中的广泛应用，公平性成为重要议题。现有研究多关注离散属性，连续属性（尤其是回归问题）的研究较少。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在支持向量回归中表现优于或与现有方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了连续公平性的应用范围，并在实际数据集中表现出竞争力。

Abstract: With the on-going integration of machine learning systems into the everyday
social life of millions the notion of fairness becomes an ever increasing
priority in their development. Fairness notions commonly rely on protected
attributes to assess potential biases. Here, the majority of literature focuses
on discrete setups regarding both target and protected attributes. The
literature on continuous attributes especially in conjunction with regression
-- we refer to this as \emph{continuous fairness} -- is scarce. A common
strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been
explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear
encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly
extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for
kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes. We demonstrate
that our novel approach in conjunction with Support Vector Regression (SVR)
provides competitive or improved performance across multiple datasets in
comparisons to other contemporary methods.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖单一最优决策树，而Rashomon集合能提供多样化的树结构，增强解释性和灵活性。

Method: 提出SORTD框架，按目标值顺序枚举Rashomon集合中的树，支持可分离和全序目标。

Result: SORTD将运行时间缩短两个数量级，支持后评估其他目标。

Conclusion: SORTD使Rashomon集合在实际应用中更实用，支持多样化的分析和选择。

Abstract: Sparse decision tree learning provides accurate and interpretable predictive
models that are ideal for high-stakes applications by finding the single most
accurate tree within a (soft) size limit. Rather than relying on a single
"best" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying
structures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich
explanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy
stakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into
the objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard,
enumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce
SORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the
Rashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior.
Our experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of
magnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute
Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports
post-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered)
objectives. Together, these advances make exploring Rashomon sets more
practical in real-world applications.

Conclusion: DMTC为无需人工标注的自主意图感知代理奠定了基础，可无缝路由用户查询至特定任务模块。

Abstract: In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention
recognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike
traditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora
and often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach
eliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of
multi-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named
DMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large
language models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different
transport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to
obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using
a novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and
maximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline
is demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation
context. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35%
and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers
and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that
Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over
alternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98%
gain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system
seamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information,
traffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation
domain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents
without costly manual labelling.

Conclusion: 统一市场机制解决了数据与模型定价的对称性问题，具有理论和实践价值。

Abstract: The rise of the machine learning (ML) model economy has intertwined markets
for training datasets and pre-trained models. However, most pricing approaches
still separate data and model transactions or rely on broker-centric pipelines
that favor one side. Recent studies of data markets with externalities capture
buyer interactions but do not yield a simultaneous and symmetric mechanism
across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers. We propose a unified
data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single
system. A supply-side mapping transforms dataset payments into buyer-visible
model quotations, while a demand-side mapping propagates buyer prices back to
datasets through Shapley-based allocation. Together, they form a closed loop
that links four interactions: supply-demand propagation in both directions and
mutual coupling among buyers and among sellers. We prove that the joint
operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence,
uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments
demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with
broker-centric and one-sided baselines. The code is available on

Motivation: 解决AlphaZero在稀疏奖励环境下早期训练阶段网络无法提供有效指导的问题。

Result: 实验表明，Adaptable HER在方程发现等任务中表现优于纯监督或强化学习方法。

Conclusion: Adaptable HER通过结合HER与AlphaZero，有效提升了稀疏奖励环境下的性能。

Abstract: AlphaZero-like Monte Carlo Tree Search systems, originally introduced for
two-player games, dynamically balance exploration and exploitation using neural
network guidance. This combination makes them also suitable for classical
search problems. However, the original method of training the network with
simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the
early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience
Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from
the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER
(\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing
easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and
trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that
the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of
pure supervised or reinforcement learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度生成模型在预测性能和可解释性之间的权衡问题。

Method: 使用稀疏连接将特征映射到潜在因子，通过专家乘积模型实现跨组学关联，并通过门控网络计算各组的贡献。

Result: 在癌症亚型分析中，POEMS实现了竞争性的聚类和分类性能，同时提供了新的解释。

Conclusion: POEMS证明了在多组学表示学习中，基于生物标志物的洞察和预测准确性可以共存。

Abstract: Integrating different molecular layers, i.e., multiomics data, is crucial for
unraveling the complexity of diseases; yet, most deep generative models either
prioritize predictive performance at the expense of interpretability or enforce
interpretability by linearizing the decoder, thereby weakening the network's
nonlinear expressiveness. To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS:
Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse
Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive
performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability
without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent
factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker
discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent
space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each
omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the
representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder.
In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and
classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations,
demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist
in multiomics representation learning.

Motivation: 现实中的强化学习问题常具有对称性，利用这些对称性可以提升学习效率。

Method: 提出了一种基于不变核的对称感知LSVI算法，量化了对称性带来的样本效率提升。

Result: 在定制Frozen Lake环境和2D布局设计问题中，对称感知RL显著优于标准核方法。

Conclusion: 结构先验在设计更高效的强化学习算法中具有重要价值。

Abstract: In many real-world reinforcement learning (RL) problems, the environment
exhibits inherent symmetries that can be exploited to improve learning
efficiency. This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for
incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a
symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI),
which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and
transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum
information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly
quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a
customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm
the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves
significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These
findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more
sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.

TL;DR: RAGBoost是一种高效的RAG系统，通过上下文重用提高缓存利用率，同时保持推理准确性，显著提升预填充性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缓存技术在提高缓存利用率时会牺牲推理质量，或在保持准确性时缓存利用率低，RAGBoost旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 通过检测并发会话和多轮交互中的重叠检索项，利用高效的上下文索引、排序和去重技术，结合轻量级上下文提示保持推理准确性。

Result: RAGBoost将预填充性能提升1.5-3倍，同时保持或提高推理准确性。

Conclusion: RAGBoost是一种高效且准确的RAG系统，适用于多样化的RAG和代理AI任务。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs)
with retrieved context but often suffers from downgraded prefill performance as
modern applications demand longer and more complex inputs. Existing caching
techniques either preserve accuracy with low cache reuse or improve reuse at
the cost of degraded reasoning quality. We present RAGBoost, an efficient RAG
system that achieves high cache reuse without sacrificing accuracy through
accuracy-preserving context reuse. RAGBoost detects overlapping retrieved items
across concurrent sessions and multi-turn interactions, using efficient context
indexing, ordering, and de-duplication to maximize reuse, while lightweight
contextual hints maintain reasoning fidelity. It integrates seamlessly with
existing LLM inference engines and improves their prefill performance by 1.5-3X
over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving or even enhancing reasoning
accuracy across diverse RAG and agentic AI workloads. Our code is released at:

TL;DR: NAP是一种基于注意力的模型，通过三轴注意力机制整合多模态预测流，显著提升零样本泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多导睡眠图信号具有高度异质性，现有模型常忽略其多模态特性，未能充分利用数据。

Method: 提出NAP模型，利用三轴注意力机制（时间、空间、预测器级）整合预训练单通道模型的输出。

Result: NAP在零样本泛化任务中优于单个预测器和简单集成方法，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: NAP不仅适用于睡眠分期，还可扩展到其他多模态生理信号分析任务。

Abstract: Polysomnography signals are highly heterogeneous, varying in modality
composition (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG), channel availability (e.g., frontal,
occipital EEG), and acquisition protocols across datasets and clinical sites.
Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset
of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently
multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural
Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine
multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures
temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to
different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained
single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and
simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across
multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging
from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other
multimodal physiological applications.

Motivation: 解决现代机器学习中的核心矛盾：为何在某些情况下，精心筛选的小数据集比大数据集表现更好。

Result: 理论推导出测试误差的缩放曲线，证明小数据集在特定条件下优于完整数据集，并在ImageNet上验证了结果。

Conclusion: 框架为数据筛选策略提供了理论依据，解释了LLM数学推理中矛盾的筛选现象。

Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework to resolve a central paradox in
modern machine learning: When is it better to use less data? This question has
become critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et
al., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et
al., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with
small, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies
where an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their
difficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for
test error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing
when and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In
contrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions,
small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical
conditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data
size and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results
on ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy
and can even mitigate model collapse. Furthermore, our framework provides a
principled explanation for the contradictory curation strategies recently
observed in LLM mathematical reasoning.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨无critic方法在策略梯度中的必要性，验证GRPO在经典RL环境中的表现。

Method: 在离散和连续控制任务中进行系统实验，对比不同基线、折扣因子和组规模的影响。

Result: 1. critic在长任务中不可替代；2. GRPO在高折扣因子下表现更好；3. 小组规模更优。

Conclusion: 无critic方法在特定条件下可行，但critic在复杂任务中仍不可或缺。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable
alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned
critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of
trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the
necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first
systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning
environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through
controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we
reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for
long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in
short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be
effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except
in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting
(gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting
limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes.
These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical
control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to
learned value functions.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中恶意客户（Byzantine）和数据分布异质性对模型鲁棒性的挑战。

Method: 将聚合权重作为可学习参数，与全局模型参数联合优化，并设计交替最小化算法。

Result: 在多种数据集和攻击场景下，新方法优于现有技术，尤其在数据高度异质和恶意客户比例高时表现突出。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了联邦学习在对抗恶意客户时的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model without sharing their private data. However, the presence of malicious
(Byzantine) clients poses significant challenges to the robustness of FL,
particularly when data distributions across clients are heterogeneous. In this
paper, we propose a novel Byzantine-robust FL optimization problem that
incorporates adaptive weighting into the aggregation process. Unlike
conventional approaches, our formulation treats aggregation weights as
learnable parameters, jointly optimizing them alongside the global model
parameters. To solve this optimization problem, we develop an alternating
minimization algorithm with strong convergence guarantees under adversarial
attack. We analyze the Byzantine resilience of the proposed objective. We
evaluate the performance of our algorithm against state-of-the-art
Byzantine-robust FL approaches across various datasets and attack scenarios.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
existing approaches, particularly in settings with highly heterogeneous data
and a large proportion of malicious clients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将信号处理概念融入神经网络设计，以平衡表达能力、紧凑性和可解释性。

Method: 使用DCT参数化的自适应激活函数，提出高效的剪枝策略去除冗余DCT系数。

Result: 在分类和隐式神经表示任务中达到SOTA精度，可安全剪枝40%的激活系数。

Conclusion: ENN框架成功实现了表达能力、紧凑性和可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: In this paper, we extend our previous work on the Expressive Neural Network
(ENN), a multilayer perceptron with adaptive activation functions parametrized
using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). Building upon previous work that
demonstrated the strong expressiveness of ENNs with compact architectures, we
now emphasize their efficiency, interpretability and pruning capabilities. The
DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated
representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows
direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we
propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients
with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across
classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs
achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters.
Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned,
thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these
findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of
signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced
trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.

Motivation: 研究学习算法泛化行为的动机，尤其是平坦最小值与泛化性能之间的联系。

Method: 在随机凸优化框架下，分析平坦最小值与泛化性能的关系，并评估两种“锐度感知”算法（SA-GD和SAM）的表现。

Result: 平坦最小值可能泛化性能较差（Ω(1)风险），而尖锐最小值泛化更优；SA-GD和SAM可能无法改善泛化性能。

Conclusion: 平坦最小值与泛化性能的关系复杂，锐度感知算法未必能提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Understanding the generalization behavior of learning algorithms is a central
goal of learning theory. A recently emerging explanation is that learning
algorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima,
which have been consistently associated with improved generalization
performance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and
generalization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with
a non-negative, $\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in
this fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur
trivial $\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally.
Then, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural
''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021),
designed to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient
Descent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which
performs gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we
prove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate,
the population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\Omega(1)$,
indicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware
gradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient
approximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although
it minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also
incur population risk $\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper
bounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) enables agents to acquire skills by observing and
replicating the behavior of one or multiple experts. In recent years, advances
in deep learning have significantly expanded the capabilities and scalability
of imitation learning across a range of domains, where expert data can range
from full state-action trajectories to partial observations or unlabeled
sequences. Alongside this growth, novel approaches have emerged, with new
methodologies being developed to address longstanding challenges such as
generalization, covariate shift, and demonstration quality. In this survey, we
review the latest advances in imitation learning research, highlighting recent
trends, methodological innovations, and practical applications. We propose a
novel taxonomy that is distinct from existing categorizations to better reflect
the current state of the IL research stratum and its trends. Throughout the
survey, we critically examine the strengths, limitations, and evaluation
practices of representative works, and we outline key challenges and open
directions for future research.

Motivation: 研究如何将预训练的LLM应用于表格预测，解决数值标记化不稳定和上下文大小受限的问题。

Method: 提出TabGemma，采用科学记数法规范化数值，并在12B Gemma 3模型上继续预训练，使用n-gram检索选择示例。

Result: 在分类任务中表现最佳，回归任务中在小样本下表现良好，但数据量增加时落后于传统方法。

Conclusion: LLM在语义任务中表现优异，但需进一步改进数值建模和长上下文扩展。

Abstract: We study LLMs for tabular prediction with mixed text, numeric, and
categorical fields. We introduce TabGemma, a schema-agnostic in-context learner
that treats rows as sequences and tackles two practical hurdles when adapting
pretrained LLMs for tabular predictions: unstable numeric tokenization and
limited context size. We propose to canonicalize numbers via signed scientific
notation and continue pretraining of a 12B Gemma 3 model with a target
imputation objective using a large-scale real world dataset. For inference, we
use a compact n-gram-based retrieval to select informative exemplars that fit
within a 128k-token window.
  On semantically rich benchmarks, TabGemma establishes a new state of the art
on classification across low- and high-data regimes and improves monotonically
with more context rows. For regression, it is competitive at small sample sizes
but trails conventional approaches as data grows. Our results show that LLMs
can be effective tabular in-context learners on highly semantic tasks when
paired with dedicated numeric handling and context retrieval, while motivating
further advances in numeric modeling and long-context scaling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经网络在求解偏微分方程时可能违反物理定律（如质量守恒、熵增等），CPL旨在通过约束投影和训练策略解决这一问题。

Method: 提出Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL)框架，通过可微投影将网络输出限制在物理约束（如守恒、熵增等）内，并结合总变差阻尼和滚动课程训练以稳定训练。

Result: CPL在Burgers和Euler系统中实现了稳定且物理合法的解，且计算开销仅增加约10%。

Conclusion: CPL将物理定律的遵守内化为学习过程的固有属性，而非依赖网络自行学习。

Abstract: Neural networks can approximate solutions to partial differential equations,
but they often break the very laws they are meant to model-creating mass from
nowhere, drifting shocks, or violating conservation and entropy. We address
this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our
framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update
physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of
constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and
positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10%
computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We
further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small
oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long
prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft
violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth
vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems,
CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy.
Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior
an intrinsic property of the learning process.

Result: 在经典控制任务中，TEQL在样本效率和总奖励上优于传统矩阵方法和深度强化学习方法。

Conclusion: TEQL适用于资源受限的高采样成本场景，如太空和医疗领域。

Abstract: High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex
calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning
algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the
number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While
neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent
tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more
parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods,
we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor
decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action
spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key
innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with
visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high
uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate
a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage
exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to
frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks
demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL
approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for
resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling
costs are high.

Conclusion: 框架在数据集规模和超参数配置上表现鲁棒，能够超越专家性能并利用传统方法无法使用的专家数据。

Abstract: Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action
demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements
severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide
only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is
often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation
reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining
deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from
observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation
Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs
expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence
mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning.
This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training
while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further
extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to
tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a
challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature.
HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging
procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to
expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental
results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns
compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit
imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous
action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging
expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter
sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset
sizes and hyperparameter configurations.

Abstract: In this paper, we formalize the almost sure convergence of $Q$-learning and
linear temporal difference (TD) learning with Markovian samples using the Lean

among the earliest and most influential reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms.
The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research
topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing
attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence
in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework
developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other
modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully
formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at

Motivation: 现有表格基础模型实现复杂、难以理解且不友好，限制了其普及和应用。

Method: nanoTabPFN通过简化架构和预生成训练数据，实现了轻量级实现。

Result: 在小型数据集上，nanoTabPFN性能接近传统机器学习基线，且预训练时间大幅缩短（160,000倍）。

Conclusion: nanoTabPFN降低了计算资源需求，使表格基础模型更易于教育和研究使用。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models such as TabPFN have revolutionized predictive
machine learning for tabular data. At the same time, the driving factors of
this revolution are hard to understand. Existing open-source tabular foundation
models are implemented in complicated pipelines boasting over 10,000 lines of
code, lack architecture documentation or code quality. In short, the
implementations are hard to understand, not beginner-friendly, and complicated
to adapt for new experiments. We introduce nanoTabPFN, a simplified and
lightweight implementation of the TabPFN v2 architecture and a corresponding
training loop that uses pre-generated training data. nanoTabPFN makes tabular
foundation models more accessible to students and researchers alike. For
example, restricted to a small data setting it achieves a performance
comparable to traditional machine learning baselines within one minute of
pre-training on a single GPU (160,000x faster than TabPFN v2 pretraining). This
eliminated requirement of large computational resources makes pre-training
tabular foundation models accessible for educational purposes. Our code is

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于机器学习的框架，用于检测医疗物联网设备中的恶意攻击和故障异常，评估了八种模型，XGBoost和KNN表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗物联网设备的安全性和可靠性面临挑战，需要有效检测恶意攻击和故障异常的方法。

Method: 使用八种机器学习模型（包括XGBoost、KNN、GAN、VAE等）在20万条记录的数据集上进行评估，涵盖监督、半监督和无监督学习。

Result: XGBoost在异常检测中达到99%准确率，KNN在攻击检测中表现最佳，GAN效果最差。

Conclusion: 该框架能提升医疗物联网安全性，通过早期检测减少数据泄露和系统故障，保障患者健康。

Abstract: The integration of IoT devices in healthcare introduces significant security
and reliability challenges, increasing susceptibility to cyber threats and
operational anomalies. This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework
for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device
anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning
models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning
(XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative
Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised
learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph
Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The
comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score,
precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost
achieved 99\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly
detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively.
LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For
attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score
with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy.
GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC.
These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective
anomaly detection strategies. By improving early detection of cyber threats and
device failures, this framework has the potential to prevent data breaches,
minimize system downtime, and ensure the continuous and safe operation of
medical devices, ultimately safeguarding patient health and trust in IoT-driven
healthcare solutions.

practical recommendations for robust reinforcement learning in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有校准方法在多分类任务中参数过多且容易过拟合，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用逻辑回归的参数化校准函数，结合结构化正则化和优化技术。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的温度、向量和矩阵缩放校准技术。

Conclusion: 提出的方法高效且易于实现，是多分类校准的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Post-hoc recalibration methods are widely used to ensure that classifiers
provide faithful probability estimates. We argue that parametric recalibration
functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple
theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight
motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard
temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies
in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often
coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff
can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing
and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains
over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and
easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an
attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling
implementations.

TL;DR: BAQ框架通过行为一致性信号和自适应机制，实现了从离线到在线强化学习的平滑过渡，提升了策略的鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习策略在动态环境中部署时，常因分布偏移和不可靠的价值估计而表现不佳。

Method: BAQ利用离线数据中的隐式行为模型，引入双目标损失函数，自适应调整在线策略与离线行为的一致性。

Result: BAQ在标准基准测试中表现优于现有方法，实现了更快的恢复速度、更强的鲁棒性和更高的性能。

Conclusion: 隐式行为适应是一种可靠且实用的策略部署解决方案。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without
online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed
in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value
estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive
Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable
transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit
behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency
signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that
(i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is
high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online
experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation
from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and
accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ
consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving
faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our
results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and
practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多智能体协作的AI框架AnaFlow，用于高效且可解释的模拟电路尺寸设计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟电路设计过程耗时且易错，现有AI方法因需大量仿真和缺乏可解释性而受限。

Method: 采用多智能体工作流，结合LLM智能体解析电路拓扑、理解设计目标，并通过可解释的推理迭代优化设计参数。

Result: AnaFlow成功应用于两种复杂度不同的电路，实现了全自动尺寸设计，且样本效率高。

Conclusion: AnaFlow为模拟EDA提供了透明设计助手的新范式，兼具高效性和可解释性。

Abstract: Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the
physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process,
resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of
AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to
automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical
bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of
explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of
the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for
sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs
a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based
agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design
goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the
target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation
strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency.
The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity
and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from
pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system
learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate
convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog
design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents
serve as transparent design assistants.

TL;DR: RLVR提出了一种基于收缩估计的基线方法，用于降低策略梯度估计的方差，提升训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决在低生成量情况下，传统基于提示的均值估计方法准确性不足的问题。

Method: 采用收缩估计器，结合提示内和跨提示的均值，改进均值估计。

Result: 理论证明和实验表明，收缩基线能降低方差，提升训练稳定性。

Conclusion: 收缩基线是一种无需额外参数或计算的高效改进方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using
policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods
typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each
prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline),
reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator.
  Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages
for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we
propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt
means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy --
particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we
construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance
policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a
drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no
additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines
consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to
lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出农业操作设计域（Ag-ODD）框架，用于描述和验证自主农业系统的操作边界，解决现有ODD概念在农业应用中的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业自动化系统在复杂多变环境中运行，现有ODD概念无法满足其独特需求，需结构化、透明且可验证的环境描述方法。

Method: Ag-ODD框架包含三个核心：1）基于ASAM Open ODD和CityGML的结构化描述；2）扩展PEGASUS 6层模型为7层模型，新增过程层；3）迭代验证流程确保完整性和一致性。

Result: 框架通过案例展示，支持自主农业系统环境描述的标准化和可扩展性。

Conclusion: Ag-ODD框架为农业自动化系统提供了明确且可验证的操作边界描述方法，填补了现有ODD的不足。

Abstract: The agricultural sector increasingly relies on autonomous systems that
operate in complex and variable environments. Unlike on-road applications,
agricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which
imposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring
consistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a
structured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,
existing Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique
challenges of agricultural applications.
  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,
which can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of
autonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core
elements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured
method for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters
using concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model
derived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process
layer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative
verification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical
scenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness
and consistency.
  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating
unambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD. Demonstrative use cases show how the Ag-ODD
Framework can support the standardization and scalability of environmental
descriptions for autonomous agricultural systems.

<details>

Motivation: 由于传统物理测试成本高且不安全，虚拟测试环境（VTE）成为替代方案，需验证其准确性。

Method: 通过实验比较不同指标，选择最佳评估方法，并生成VTE进行LiDAR扫描对比。

Result: DCD在所有情况下表现最佳，模拟与真实LiDAR扫描在几何和感知模型输出上存在差异。

Conclusion: DCD是评估模拟LiDAR扫描准确性的有效指标，VTE可用于安全测试，但需进一步优化。

Abstract: For developing safe Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), rigorous testing is
required before they are deemed safe for road deployments. Since comprehensive
conventional physical testing is impractical due to cost and safety concerns,
Virtual Testing Environments (VTE) can be adopted as an alternative. Comparing
VTE-generated sensor outputs against their real-world analogues can be a strong
indication that the VTE accurately represents reality. Correspondingly, this
work explores a comprehensive experimental approach to finding evaluation
metrics suitable for comparing real-world and simulated LiDAR scans. The
metrics were tested in terms of sensitivity and accuracy with different noise,
density, distortion, sensor orientation, and channel settings. From comparing
the metrics, we found that Density Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) works best
across all cases. In the second step of the research, a Virtual Testing
Environment was generated using real LiDAR scan data. The data was collected in
a controlled environment with only static objects using an instrumented vehicle
equipped with LiDAR, IMU and cameras. Simulated LiDAR scans were generated from
the VTEs using the same pose as real LiDAR scans. The simulated and LiDAR scans
were compared in terms of model perception and geometric similarity. Actual and
simulated LiDAR scans have a similar semantic segmentation output with a mIoU
of 21\% with corrected intensity and an average density aware chamfer distance
(DCD) of 0.63. This indicates a slight difference in the geometric properties
of simulated and real LiDAR scans and a significant difference between model
outputs. During the comparison, density-aware chamfer distance was found to be
the most correlated among the metrics with perception methods.

Conclusion: AURA为可信赖、持续改进的人机协作团队提供了实现模式。

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous systems in safety-critical settings
requires a paradigm that combines human expertise with AI-driven analysis,
especially when anomalies are unforeseen. We introduce AURA (Autonomous
Resilience Agent), a collaborative framework for anomaly and fault diagnostics
in robotics. AURA integrates large language models (LLMs), a high-fidelity
digital twin (DT), and human-in-the-loop interaction to detect and respond to
anomalous behavior in real time. The architecture uses two agents with clear
roles: (i) a low-level State Anomaly Characterization Agent that monitors
telemetry and converts signals into a structured natural-language problem
description, and (ii) a high-level Diagnostic Reasoning Agent that conducts a
knowledge-grounded dialogue with an operator to identify root causes, drawing
on external sources. Human-validated diagnoses are then converted into new
training examples that refine the low-level perceptual model. This feedback
loop progressively distills expert knowledge into the AI, transforming it from
a static tool into an adaptive partner. We describe the framework's operating
principles and provide a concrete implementation, establishing a pattern for
trustworthy, continually improving human-robot teams.

Result: 在三个真实机器人任务中验证了方法的有效性，规划显著优于BC基线。

Conclusion: 基于模型的方法通过规划显著提升了任务性能，适用于复杂机器人任务。

Abstract: Robots must understand their environment from raw sensory inputs and reason
about the consequences of their actions in it to solve complex tasks. Behavior
Cloning (BC) leverages task-specific human demonstrations to learn this
knowledge as end-to-end policies. However, these policies are difficult to
transfer to new tasks, and generating training data is challenging because it
requires careful demonstrations and frequent environment resets. In contrast to
such policy-based view, in this paper we take a model-based approach where we
collect a few hours of unstructured easy-to-collect play data to learn an
action-conditioned visual world model, a diffusion-based action sampler, and
optionally a reward model. The world model -- in combination with the action
sampler and a reward model -- is then used to optimize long sequences of
actions with a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner. The resulting plans are
executed on the robot via a zeroth-order Model Predictive Controller (MPC). We
show that the action sampler mitigates hallucinations of the world model during
planning and validate our approach on 3 real-world robotic tasks with varying
levels of planning and modeling complexity. Our experiments support the
hypothesis that planning leads to a significant improvement over BC baselines
on a standard manipulation test environment.

Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a key role in enabling dexterous and reliable robotic
manipulation, but realizing this capability requires substantial calibration to
convert raw sensor readings into physically meaningful quantities. Despite its
near-universal necessity, the calibration process remains ad hoc and
labor-intensive. Here, we introduce \libname{}, an open-source library that
transforms a low-cost 3D printer into an automated probing device capable of
generating large volumes of labeled training data for tactile sensor
calibration. We demonstrate the utility of \libname{} by calibrating two
commercially available vision-based tactile sensors, DIGIT and GelSight Mini,
to reconstruct high-quality depth maps using the collected data and a custom
convolutional neural network. In addition, we perform a data ablation study to
determine how much data is needed for accurate calibration, providing practical
guidelines for researchers working with these specific sensors, and we
benchmark the trained models on previously unseen objects to evaluate
calibration accuracy and generalization performance. By automating tactile
sensor calibration, \libname{} can accelerate tactile sensing research,
simplify sensor deployment, and promote the practical integration of tactile
sensing in robotic platforms.

Abstract: We introduce SENT-Map, a semantically enhanced topological map for

representing the environment in a JSON text format, we enable semantic
information to be added and edited in a format that both humans and FMs
understand, while grounding the robot to existing nodes during planning to
avoid infeasible states during deployment. Our proposed framework employs a two
stage approach, first mapping the environment alongside an operator with a
Vision-FM, then using the SENT-Map representation alongside a natural-language
query within an FM for planning. Our experimental results show that
semantic-enhancement enables even small locally-deployable FMs to successfully
plan over indoor environments.

Abstract: Multi-legged robots offer enhanced stability to navigate complex terrains
with their multiple legs interacting with the environment. However, how to
effectively coordinate the multiple legs in a larger action exploration space
to generate natural and robust movements is a key issue. In this paper, we
introduce a motion prior-based approach, successfully applying deep
reinforcement learning algorithms to a real hexapod robot. We generate a
dataset of optimized motion priors, and train an adversarial discriminator
based on the priors to guide the hexapod robot to learn natural gaits. The
learned policy is then successfully transferred to a real hexapod robot, and
demonstrate natural gait patterns and remarkable robustness without visual
information in complex terrains. This is the first time that a reinforcement
learning controller has been used to achieve complex terrain walking on a real
hexapod robot.

Conclusion: 统一策略减少了专用模型需求，支持可控人类监督，并有效连接高层意图与精细力控制。

Abstract: Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and
retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper,
bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains
difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the
need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the
task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem
involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper.
Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly
wrapped package with clean folds and no tears.
  We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task
planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid
imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is
a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from
human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal
dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike
vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short
tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal
grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process
and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than
merely replicating motion sequences.
  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We
show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized
models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level
intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object
manipulation.

Abstract: This paper explores a physical human-robot collaboration (pHRC) task
involving the joint insertion of a board into a frame by a sightless robot and
a human operator. While admittance control is commonly used in pHRC tasks, it
can be challenging to measure the force/torque applied by the human for
accurate human intent estimation, limiting the robot's ability to assist in the
collaborative task. Other methods that attempt to solve pHRC tasks using
reinforcement learning (RL) are also unsuitable for the board-insertion task
due to its safety constraints and sparse rewards. Therefore, we propose a novel
RL approach that utilizes a human-designed admittance controller to facilitate
more active robot behavior and reduce human effort. Through simulation and
real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms admittance
control in terms of success rate and task completion time. Additionally, we
observed a significant reduction in measured force/torque when using our
proposed approach compared to admittance control. The video of the experiments

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GUIDES框架通过语义指导增强预训练机器人策略，无需架构重设计，显著提升任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练机器人策略缺乏语义意识，完全替换成本高且丢失知识。

Method: 利用微调视觉语言模型生成指令，通过辅助模块编码为嵌入，注入策略潜在空间。

Result: 在RoboCasa仿真环境和UR5机器人上验证，任务成功率和运动精度显著提升。

Conclusion: GUIDES为升级已验证机器人策略提供了高效实用的途径。

Abstract: Pre-trained robot policies serve as the foundation of many validated robotic
systems, which encapsulate extensive embodied knowledge. However, they often
lack the semantic awareness characteristic of foundation models, and replacing
them entirely is impractical in many situations due to high costs and the loss
of accumulated knowledge. To address this gap, we introduce GUIDES, a
lightweight framework that augments pre-trained policies with semantic guidance
from foundation models without requiring architectural redesign. GUIDES employs
a fine-tuned vision-language model (Instructor) to generate contextual
instructions, which are encoded by an auxiliary module into guidance
embeddings. These embeddings are injected into the policy's latent space,
allowing the legacy model to adapt to this new semantic input through brief,
targeted fine-tuning. For inference-time robustness, a large language
model-based Reflector monitors the Instructor's confidence and, when confidence
is low, initiates a reasoning loop that analyzes execution history, retrieves
relevant examples, and augments the VLM's context to refine subsequent actions.
Extensive validation in the RoboCasa simulation environment across diverse
policy architectures shows consistent and substantial improvements in task
success rates. Real-world deployment on a UR5 robot further demonstrates that
GUIDES enhances motion precision for critical sub-tasks such as grasping.
Overall, GUIDES offers a practical and resource-efficient pathway to upgrade,
rather than replace, validated robot policies.

TL;DR: 通过参与式设计工作坊，研究社交辅助机器人如何支持社交焦虑患者，揭示了适应性、接受性和有效性等核心设计价值观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交焦虑普遍且治疗支持不足，技术尤其是社交机器人提供了新的辅助手段，需了解用户需求以设计有效解决方案。

Method: 与心理健康学术研究者进行参与式设计工作坊，通过创意、反思和设想活动系统收集价值观、期望和需求。

Result: 研究发现适应性、接受性和有效性是设计社交辅助机器人支持社交焦虑的核心价值观。

Conclusion: 强调以用户为中心和情境感知的设计方法在开发社交辅助机器人中的重要性。

Abstract: Social anxiety is a prevalent mental health condition that can significantly
impact overall well-being and quality of life. Despite its widespread effects,
adequate support or treatment for social anxiety is often insufficient.
Advances in technology, particularly in social robotics, offer promising
opportunities to complement traditional mental health. As an initial step
toward developing effective solutions, it is essential to understand the values
that shape what is considered meaningful, acceptable, and helpful. In this
study, a participatory design workshop was conducted with mental health
academic researchers to elicit the underlying values that should inform the
design of socially assistive robots for social anxiety support. Through
creative, reflective, and envisioning activities, participants explored
scenarios and design possibilities, allowing for systematic elicitation of
values, expectations, needs, and preferences related to robot-supported
interventions. The findings reveal rich insights into design-relevant
values-including adaptivity, acceptance, and efficacy-that are core to support
for individuals with social anxiety. This study highlights the significance of
a research-led approach to value elicitation, emphasising user-centred and
context-aware design considerations in the development of socially assistive
robots.

Motivation: 复制人类手部的多功能能力（如运动、感知和协调操作）在机器人系统中仍是一个巨大挑战。

Method: 提出了一种基于本体力感知的导纳控制方法，以提高操作能力。

Result: 实验结果显示，单指负载能力超过10 N，指尖重复性低于0.001 m，力估计误差低于0.2 N，多物体抓取时关节扭矩减少31.19%。

Conclusion: 该研究推动了轻量化、工业级灵巧手的设计，并增强了本体感知控制，为机器人操作和智能制造做出了贡献。

Abstract: The human hand plays a vital role in daily life and industrial applications,
yet replicating its multifunctional capabilities-including motion, sensing, and
coordinated manipulation-with robotic systems remains a formidable challenge.
Developing a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with
engineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability,
and force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a
high-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7
passive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight
1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control
method to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior
performance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip
repeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared
to PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%,
significantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload
during collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps,
successfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation
tasks. This work advances the design of lightweight, industrial-grade dexterous
hands and enhances proprioceptive control, contributing to robotic manipulation
and intelligent manufacturing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Agentic Embodied AI领域的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白，提供工具支持机器人数据分析。

Method: 开发了MCP服务器和轻量级UI，支持ROS 2 CLI工具，并集成了多种LLM/VLM模型进行实验。

Result: 实验表明Kimi K2和Claude Sonnet 4在工具调用能力上表现最佳，工具描述和数量影响成功率。

Conclusion: 论文展示了MCP在机器人数据分析中的潜力，并开源了代码。

Abstract: Agentic AI systems and Physical or Embodied AI systems have been two key
research verticals at the forefront of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics,
with Model Context Protocol (MCP) increasingly becoming a key component and
enabler of agentic applications. However, the literature at the intersection of
these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper
introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for
analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through
LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain
knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting
natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time
series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2
CLI tools ("ros2 bag list" or "ros2 bag info"), as well as the ability to
filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP
server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling
with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source
(through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling
capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both
proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that
there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude
Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that
there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool
description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools
available to the models. The code is available with a permissive license at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类常误以为机器人与自己的视野相同，导致协作失败，尤其是在机器人无法扫描场景时。

Method: 设计四种AR视野指示器（从自我中心到任务中心），并通过用户实验（N=41）评估其效果。

Result: 任务中心的指示器准确率最高，但解读延迟；自我中心的深眼窝设计也能提高准确性。参与者信心高且认知负荷低。

Conclusion: 提出六条指南，帮助实践者应用AR指示器或物理改造，以对齐人类对机器人视野的认知。

Abstract: Research indicates that humans can mistakenly assume that robots and humans
have the same field of view (FoV), possessing an inaccurate mental model of
robots. This misperception may lead to failures during human-robot
collaboration tasks where robots might be asked to complete impossible tasks
about out-of-view objects. The issue is more severe when robots do not have a
chance to scan the scene to update their world model while focusing on assigned
tasks. To help align humans' mental models of robots' vision capabilities, we
propose four FoV indicators in augmented reality (AR) and conducted a user
human-subjects experiment (N=41) to evaluate them in terms of accuracy,
confidence, task efficiency, and workload. These indicators span a spectrum
from egocentric (robot's eye and head space) to allocentric (task space).
Results showed that the allocentric blocks at the task space had the highest
accuracy with a delay in interpreting the robot's FoV. The egocentric indicator
of deeper eye sockets, possible for physical alteration, also increased
accuracy. In all indicators, participants' confidence was high while cognitive
load remained low. Finally, we contribute six guidelines for practitioners to
apply our AR indicators or physical alterations to align humans' mental models
with robots' vision capabilities.

Motivation: 现有语义场景补全系统主要针对轮式平台，缺乏对步态机器人身体抖动和360度连续性的支持。

Method: 结合双投影融合、双网格体素化、轻量级解码器和步态位移补偿模块。

Result: 在QuadOcc和H3O数据集上达到SOTA性能，分别提升3.83和8.08 mIoU。

Conclusion: OneOcc为腿式/人形机器人提供了高效的全景感知解决方案，模块轻量且可部署。

Abstract: Robust 3D semantic occupancy is crucial for legged/humanoid robots, yet most
semantic scene completion (SSC) systems target wheeled platforms with
forward-facing sensors. We present OneOcc, a vision-only panoramic SSC
framework designed for gait-introduced body jitter and 360{\deg} continuity.
OneOcc combines: (i) Dual-Projection fusion (DP-ER) to exploit the annular
panorama and its equirectangular unfolding, preserving 360{\deg} continuity and
grid alignment; (ii) Bi-Grid Voxelization (BGV) to reason in Cartesian and
cylindrical-polar spaces, reducing discretization bias and sharpening
free/occupied boundaries; (iii) a lightweight decoder with Hierarchical AMoE-3D
for dynamic multi-scale fusion and better long-range/occlusion reasoning; and
(iv) plug-and-play Gait Displacement Compensation (GDC) learning feature-level
motion correction without extra sensors. We also release two panoramic
occupancy benchmarks: QuadOcc (real quadruped, first-person 360{\deg}) and
Human360Occ (H3O) (CARLA human-ego 360{\deg} with RGB, Depth, semantic
occupancy; standardized within-/cross-city splits). OneOcc sets new
state-of-the-art (SOTA): on QuadOcc it beats strong vision baselines and
popular LiDAR ones; on H3O it gains +3.83 mIoU (within-city) and +8.08
(cross-city). Modules are lightweight, enabling deployable full-surround
perception for legged/humanoid robots. Datasets and code will be publicly
available at https://github.com/MasterHow/OneOcc.

Motivation: 现有的人机交互个性化方法多关注单用户适应，忽略了多用户场景中可能存在的偏好冲突。

Method: 采用定量双极论证框架（QBAF），结合用户参数和机器人动态观察，迭代计算偏好强度。

Result: 通过实际案例验证了框架的有效性，展示了其在解决护理员与被护理者冲突中的应用。

Conclusion: 该框架为多用户人机交互提供了一种透明、结构化且上下文敏感的冲突解决方法。

Abstract: While personalisation in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has advanced
significantly, most existing approaches focus on single-user adaptation,
overlooking scenarios involving multiple stakeholders with potentially
conflicting preferences. To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences
Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user
personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation
Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference
conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically
assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates
both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment,
allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts.
Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose
strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's
properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic
case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting
preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment
task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base
scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and
contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and
context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work
advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to
data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world
environments.

Result: 方法在多样流形约束任务中表现优异，适用于高维多智能体操作问题，速度快于现有约束运动规划器。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能生成安全且任务可行的运动计划，无需假设其他智能体策略，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Safe multi-agent motion planning (MAMP) under task-induced constraints is a
critical challenge in robotics. Many real-world scenarios require robots to
navigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by
tasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding
collisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in
decentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold
constraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a
manifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for
decentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints
to capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a
decentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate
motion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions
about other agents' policies. Our approach generalizes across diverse
manifold-constrained tasks and scales effectively to high-dimensional
multi-agent manipulation problems. Experiments show that our method outperforms
existing constrained motion planners and operates at speeds suitable for
real-world applications. Video demonstrations are available at

Conclusion: 提出了高效且鲁棒的算法，适用于复杂几何域内的入侵者搜索。

Abstract: We consider the problem of searching for an intruder in a geometric domain by
utilizing multiple search robots. The domain is a simply connected orthogonal
polygon with edges parallel to the cartesian coordinate axes. Each robot has a
limited sensing capability. We study the problem for both static and mobile
intruders. It turns out that the problem of finding an intruder is NP-hard,
even for a stationary intruder. Given this intractability, we turn our
attention towards developing efficient and robust algorithms, namely methods
based on space-filling curves, random search, and cooperative random search.
Moreover, for each proposed algorithm, we evaluate the trade-off between the
number of search robots and the time required for the robots to complete the
search process while considering the geometric properties of the connected
orthogonal search area.

infrared (IR) motion capture camera and LiDAR technology, enabling precise
location tracking tailored specifically for largescale artistic applications.
We employ a unique control architecture that uses different regulation in
tangential and normal directions relative to the planned path, enabling precise
trajectory tracking and stable line rendering. We also present algorithms for
trajectory planning and path optimization, allowing for complex curve drawing
and area filling. The system includes a custom-designed paint spraying
mechanism, specifically engineered to function effectively amidst the turbulent
airflow generated by the drone's propellers, which also protects the drone's
critical components from paint-related damage, ensuring longevity and
consistent performance. Experimental results demonstrate the system's
robustness and precision in varied conditions, showcasing its potential for

Abstract: This paper addresses a motion planning problem to achieve
spatio-temporal-logical tasks, expressed by syntactically co-safe linear
temporal logic specifications (scLTL\next), in uncertain environments. Here,
the uncertainty is modeled as some probabilistic knowledge on the semantic
labels of the environment. For example, the task is "first go to region 1, then
go to region 2"; however, the exact locations of regions 1 and 2 are not known
a priori, instead a probabilistic belief is available. We propose a novel
automata-theoretic approach, where a special product automaton is constructed
to capture the uncertainty related to semantic labels, and a reward function is
designed for each edge of this product automaton. The proposed algorithm
utilizes value iteration for online replanning. We show some theoretical
results and present some simulations/experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach.

Abstract: This study investigates how human motion cues can be used to design
expressive robot-arm movements. Using the imperfect-information game Geister,
we analyzed two types of human piece-moving motions: natural gameplay
(unconscious tendencies) and instructed expressions (intentional cues). Based
on these findings, we created phase-specific robot motions by varying movement
speed and stop duration, and evaluated observer impressions under two
presentation modalities: a physical robot and a recorded video. Results
indicate that late-phase motion timing, particularly during withdrawal, plays
an important role in impression formation and that physical embodiment enhances
the interpretability of motion cues. These findings provide insights for
designing expressive robot motions based on human timing behavior.

Conclusion: 这种无外部能源的紧凑设计为软机器人提供了轻量级、刚度自适应的流体驱动操作新方案。

Abstract: Conventional fluid-driven soft grippers typically depend on external sources,
which limit portability and long-term autonomy. This work introduces a
self-contained soft gripper with fixed size that operates solely through
internal liquid redistribution among three interconnected bistable snap-through
chambers. When the top sensing chamber deforms upon contact, the displaced
liquid triggers snap-through expansion of the grasping chambers, enabling
stable and size-selective grasping without continuous energy input. The
internal hydraulic feedback further allows passive adaptation of gripping
pressure to object stiffness. This source-free and compact design opens new
possibilities for lightweight, stiffness-adaptive fluid-driven manipulation in
soft robotics, providing a feasible approach for targeted size-specific
sampling and operation in underwater and field environments.
