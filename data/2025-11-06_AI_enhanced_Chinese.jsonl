Unlike on-road applications,\nagricultural automation integrates driving and working processes, each of which\nimposes distinct operational constraints. Handling this complexity and ensuring\nconsistency throughout the development and validation processes requires a\nstructured, transparent, and verified description of the environment. However,\nexisting Operational Design Domain (ODD) concepts do not yet address the unique\nchallenges of agricultural applications.\n  Therefore, this work introduces the Agricultural ODD (Ag-ODD) Framework,\nwhich can be used to describe and verify the operational boundaries of\nautonomous agricultural systems. The Ag-ODD Framework consists of three core\nelements. First, the Ag-ODD description concept, which provides a structured\nmethod for unambiguously defining environmental and operational parameters\nusing concepts from ASAM Open ODD and CityGML. Second, the 7-Layer Model\nderived from the PEGASUS 6-Layer Model, has been extended to include a process\nlayer to capture dynamic agricultural operations. Third, the iterative\nverification process verifies the Ag-ODD against its corresponding logical\nscenarios, derived from the 7-Layer Model, to ensure the Ag-ODD's completeness\nand consistency.\n  Together, these elements provide a consistent approach for creating\nunambiguous and verifiable Ag-ODD.

However, these contests do not reflect\nthe depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new\nbenchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced\nmathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each\nwith 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a\ndifficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD\nqualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both\nPhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our\nevaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a\nstark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3%\n(pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals\nthat models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their\nability to formalize this reasoning.

This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process\nand supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than\nmerely replicating motion sequences.\n  Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks.

This paper\nintroduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for\nanalyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through\nLLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain\nknowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting\nnatively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time\nseries data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2\nCLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to\nfilter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP\nserver, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling\nwith different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source\n(through Groq).

However, designing heterogeneous\nmetamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and\nstrict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional\nconcurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization\nproblem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell\nboundaries.

In this work, we\npropose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a\ncontinuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly\naddressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural\nrepresentation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and\nlocal (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that\nrepresents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across\nthe domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility\nloss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells.\nOnce trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high\nresolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation.\nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical\nmetamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems\nwith potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u4e24\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u8d28\u5355\u5143\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5f02\u8d28\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u5927\u3001\u5355\u5143\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e14\u9700\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8f93\u5165\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5750\u6807\uff0c\u8f93\u51fa\u9690\u5f0f\u573a\u8868\u793a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u635f\u5931\u786e\u4fdd\u5355\u5143\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u68b0\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u3001\u8d1f\u6cca\u677e\u6bd4\u548c\u673a\u68b0\u9690\u8eab\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u8d28\u8d85\u6750\u6599\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Many real-world scenarios require robots to\nnavigate dynamic environments while adhering to manifold constraints imposed by\ntasks. For example, service robots must carry cups upright while avoiding\ncollisions with humans or other robots. Despite recent advances in\ndecentralized MAMP for high-dimensional systems, incorporating manifold\nconstraints remains difficult. To address this, we propose a\nmanifold-constrained Hamilton-Jacobi reachability (HJR) learning framework for\ndecentralized MAMP. Our method solves HJR problems under manifold constraints\nto capture task-aware safety conditions, which are then integrated into a\ndecentralized trajectory optimization planner. This enables robots to generate\nmotion plans that are both safe and task-feasible without requiring assumptions\nabout other agents' policies.

For example,\nwe may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a\ncircuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a\nproperty predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a\ngenerative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to\nconcentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization\n-- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as\nreinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that\nmaximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over\ndiscrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial\nnature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific\napplications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over\ndesign variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective\noptimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may\nonly loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve\nmaximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are\nunable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and\ndemonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm,\nDecomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any\ndecomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make\noptimization more efficient.

If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not\ntraverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps\nshould bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature.\nTo test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence\nand the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a\nfull paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and\nlayers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat\nangles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality\nor chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe\ndeflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable,\nmeaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm\nattention-induced curvature.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06Transformer\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7c7b\u6bd4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u66f2\u7387\u5f71\u54cdtoken\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6f14\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u666f\u89c2\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u89d2\u5ea6\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u8f91\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9etoken\u5d4c\u5165\u8def\u5f84\u56e0\u66f2\u7387\u800c\u5f2f\u66f2\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f2f\u66f2\u4e0e\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u786e\u5b9e\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5e7f\u4e49\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u66f2\u7387\uff0c\u5f71\u54cdtoken\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u3002"}}

We address these\nchallenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and\nsample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically\nrelevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we\nintroduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables\nDiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while\nsatisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles.\nSecond, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the\nreinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts\nto evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal.\nTogether, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when\nvalidated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including\nwarehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our\nmethod consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39%\nhigher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This\nsets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone\ntowards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiCoDe\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4ee3\u7406-\u73af\u5883\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Projected Universal Guidance\u548ccritic distillation\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff0cDiCoDe\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DiCoDe\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86Projected Universal Guidance\uff08PUG\uff09\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u548ccritic distillation\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u591a\u4ee3\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u98ce\u7535\u573a\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDiCoDe\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u5728\u4ed3\u5e93\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u63d0\u534739%\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u51cf\u5c1166%\u3002", "conclusion": "DiCoDe\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406-\u73af\u5883\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Considering that many robotic tasks --\nparticularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across\nvarying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is\nessential.

Early exiting in conjunction with multi-stage predictors, when\ncooperated with a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy, offers a\nstraightforward way to achieve an inference-efficient model. However, a key\nchallenge remains unresolved: How can early stages provide low-level\nfundamental features to deep stages while simultaneously supplying high-level\ndiscriminative features to early-stage predictors? To address this problem, we\npropose a Decoupled Multi-Predictor Optimization (DMPO) method to effectively\ndecouple the low-level representative ability and high-level discriminative\nability in early stages. First, in terms of architecture, we introduce a\nlightweight bypass module into multi-stage predictors for functional\ndecomposition of shallow features from early stages, while a high-order\nstatistics-based predictor is developed for early stages to effectively enhance\ntheir discriminative ability.

Methods such as CoOp and\nCoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors,\nknown as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these\nmodels often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While\ntraditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data\naugmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based\nmodifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely\nunexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations,\nparticularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support\nand enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between\nthese augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to\nimprove generalization.

We evaluate the approach on two\ndistinct localisation problems: (i) predicting the time of morphological\ntransition in 20-second, two-lead ECG signals, and (ii) regressing the\ncoordinates of nuclear centres in cytological images from the SiPaKMeD dataset.\nIn both cases, the proposed representation yields faster convergence and higher\ngeneralisation performance relative to conventional coordinate-channel\napproaches, demonstrating its effectiveness across both one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional biomedical signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u7eaf\u5750\u6807\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u590d\u6742\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982CoordConv\u5c42\u901a\u8fc7\u9644\u52a0\u5750\u6807\u901a\u9053\u5b66\u4e60\u7edd\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u8003\u8651\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5c06\u7eaf\u5750\u6807\u901a\u9053\u66ff\u6362\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u5f3a\u5ea6-\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8026\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728ECG\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u7ec6\u80de\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5750\u6807\u901a\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u5750\u6807\u8868\u793a\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e00\u7ef4\u548c\u4e8c\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

The applicability of the proposed pipeline\nis demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation\ncontext.

This question has\nbecome critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et\nal., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et\nal., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with\nsmall, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies\nwhere an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their\ndifficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for\ntest error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing\nwhen and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization.

Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns\ncompared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit\nimitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance.
