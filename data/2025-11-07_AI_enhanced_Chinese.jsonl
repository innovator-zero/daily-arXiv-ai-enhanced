To guide humans towards the optimized posture, the reference\nend-effector poses of the robot are generated through a transformation module.\nA bimanual model predictive impedance controller (MPIC) is proposed for our\nhuman-like robot, CURI, to recalibrate the end effector poses through planned\ntrajectories. The proposed method has been validated through various subjects\nand objects during human-human collaboration (HHC) and human-robot\ncollaboration (HRC).

While Unmanned\nAerial Vehicle (UAV) swarms offer a promising solution for tasks like wide-area\nsearch and supply delivery, yet their effective coordination places a\nsignificant cognitive burden on human operators. The core human-machine\ncollaboration bottleneck lies in the ``intention-to-action gap'', which is an\nerror-prone process of translating a high-level rescue objective into a\nlow-level swarm command under high intensity and pressure. To bridge this gap,\nthis study proposes a novel LLM-CRF system that leverages Large Language Models\n(LLMs) to model and augment human-swarm teaming cognition. The proposed\nframework initially captures the operator's intention through natural and\nmulti-modal interactions with the device via voice or graphical annotations. It\nthen employs the LLM as a cognitive engine to perform intention comprehension,\nhierarchical task decomposition, and mission planning for the UAV swarm. This\nclosed-loop framework enables the swarm to act as a proactive partner,\nproviding active feedback in real-time while reducing the need for manual\nmonitoring and control, which considerably advances the efficacy of the SAR\ntask. We evaluate the proposed framework in a simulated SAR scenario.\nExperimental results demonstrate that, compared to traditional order and\ncommand-based interfaces, the proposed LLM-driven approach reduced task\ncompletion time by approximately $64.2\\%$ and improved task success rate by\n$7\\%$.

This paper\npresents a biomimetic control framework based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN),\ninspired by the human Central Nervous System (CNS), to achieve agile control in\nsuch environments. The proposed framework features five control modules\n(cerebral cortex, cerebellum, thalamus, brainstem, spinal cord), three\nhierarchical control levels (first-order, second-order, third-order), and two\ninformation pathways (ascending, descending). Each module is fully implemented\nusing SNN. The spinal cord module uses spike encoding and Leaky\nIntegrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons for feedback control. The brainstem module\nemploys a network of LIF and non-spiking LIF neurons to dynamically adjust\nspinal cord parameters via reinforcement learning. The thalamus module\nsimilarly adjusts the cerebellum's torque outputs.

However, this leads to\nincomplete reconstructions, missing all occluded surfaces. While much progress\nhas been made on reconstructing entire objects given partial observations using\ngenerative models, the structural elements of a scene, like the walls, floors\nand ceilings, have received less attention. We argue that these scene elements\nshould be relatively easy to predict, since they are typically planar,\nrepetitive and simple, and so less costly approaches may be suitable.

This study proposes a lightweight and cost-effective\nbiometric authentication framework based on PPG signals extracted from\nlow-frame-rate fingertip videos. The CFIHSR dataset, comprising PPG recordings\nfrom 46 subjects at a sampling rate of 14 Hz, is employed for evaluation. The\nraw PPG signals undergo a standard preprocessing pipeline involving baseline\ndrift removal, motion artifact suppression using Principal Component Analysis\n(PCA), bandpass filtering, Fourier-based resampling, and amplitude\nnormalization. To generate robust representations, each one-dimensional PPG\nsegment is converted into a two-dimensional time-frequency scalogram via the\nContinuous Wavelet Transform (CWT), effectively capturing transient\ncardiovascular dynamics. We developed a hybrid deep learning model, termed\nCVT-ConvMixer-LSTM, by combining spatial features from the Convolutional Vision\nTransformer (CVT) and ConvMixer branches with temporal features from a Long\nShort-Term Memory network (LSTM).

Existing approaches primarily align neural activity\ndirectly with visual embeddings, but visual-only representations often fail to\ncapture latent semantic dimensions, limiting interpretability and deep\nrobustness. To address these limitations, we propose Bratrix, the first\nend-to-end framework to achieve multimodal Language-Anchored Vision-Brain\nalignment. Bratrix decouples visual stimuli into hierarchical visual and\nlinguistic semantic components, and projects both visual and brain\nrepresentations into a shared latent space, enabling the formation of aligned\nvisual-language and brain-language embeddings. To emulate human-like perceptual\nreliability and handle noisy neural signals, Bratrix incorporates a novel\nuncertainty perception module that applies uncertainty-aware weighting during\nalignment.

However, current VLA models typically\ncontain massive parameters and rely heavily on large-scale robot data\npretraining, leading to high computational costs during training, as well as\nlimited deployability for real-time inference. Moreover, most training\nparadigms often degrade the perceptual representations of the vision-language\nbackbone, resulting in overfitting and poor generalization to downstream tasks.\nIn this work, we present Evo-1, a lightweight VLA model that reduces\ncomputation and improves deployment efficiency, while maintaining strong\nperformance without pretraining on robot data. Evo-1 builds on a native\nmultimodal Vision-Language model (VLM), incorporating a novel cross-modulated\ndiffusion transformer along with an optimized integration module, together\nforming an effective architecture. We further introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm that progressively aligns action with perception, preserving the\nrepresentations of the VLM.

CNN-based segmentation methods excel at local\nfeature extraction, but struggle with modeling long-range dependencies.\nTransformers, on the other hand, capture global context more effectively, but\nare inherently data-hungry and computationally expensive. In this work, we\nintroduce UKAST, a U-Net like architecture that integrates rational-function\nbased Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into Swin Transformer encoders. By\nleveraging rational base functions and Group Rational KANs (GR-KANs) from the\nKolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (KAT), our architecture addresses the\ninefficiencies of vanilla spline-based KANs, yielding a more expressive and\ndata-efficient framework with reduced FLOPs and only a very small increase in\nparameter count compared to SwinUNETR.

Notably, it\nattains superior accuracy in data-scarce settings, alleviating the data-hungry\nlimitations of standard Vision Transformers.

Shared autonomy has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such\nfailures by incorporating human input when autonomy is uncertain.

We first study the framework in a mock-human setting, where it\nachieves perfect recall alongside high accuracy and precision. A human-subject\nsurvey further shows strong alignment, with participants agreeing with\narbitration outcomes in 92% of cases. Finally, evaluation on the Bench2Drive\nbenchmark demonstrates a substantial reduction in collision rate and\nimprovement in overall performance compared to pure autonomy.

Our\nerror-bound analysis shows that the additional guidance branch is more robust\nto approximation, revealing substantial redundancy that conventional solvers\nfail to exploit. Building on this insight, THG significantly reduces the\ncomputation of the additional guidance: the noise estimate is integrated with\nthe tortoise equation on the original, fine-grained timestep grid, while the\nadditional guidance is integrated with the hare equation only on a coarse grid.\nWe also introduce (i) an error-bound-aware timestep sampler that adaptively\nselects step sizes and (ii) a guidance-scale scheduler that stabilizes large\nextrapolation spans.

However, humans and robots differ\nfundamentally in embodiment, resulting in mismatched action execution. Direct\nkinematic retargeting of human hand motion can therefore produce actions that\nare physically infeasible for robots. Despite these low-level differences,\nhuman demonstrations provide valuable motion cues about how to manipulate and\ninteract with objects. Our key idea is to exploit the forward diffusion\nprocess: as noise is added to actions, low-level execution differences fade\nwhile high-level task guidance is preserved. We present X-Diffusion, a\nprincipled framework for training diffusion policies that maximally leverages\nhuman data without learning dynamically infeasible motions. X-Diffusion first\ntrains a classifier to predict whether a noisy action is executed by a human or\nrobot. Then, a human action is incorporated into policy training only after\nadding sufficient noise such that the classifier cannot discern its embodiment.\nActions consistent with robot execution supervise fine-grained denoising at low\nnoise levels, while mismatched human actions provide only coarse guidance at\nhigher noise levels.

At its core is a unified spring-based\nformulation that models both resistive contacts (restoring forces when pressing\nagainst surfaces) and guiding contacts (pushes or pulls sampled from human\nmotion data). This formulation ensures kinematically consistent forces across\nthe shoulder, elbow, and wrist, while exposing the policy to diverse\ninteraction scenarios. Safety is further supported through task-adjustable\nforce thresholds. We evaluate our approach in both simulation and on the\nUnitree G1 humanoid across tasks requiring different levels of compliance,\nincluding gentle hugging, sit-to-stand assistance, and safe object\nmanipulation.

However, the complicated maritime environment often\ncauses camera motion and subsequent visual degradation, posing significant\nchallenges to MOT. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient\nDual-branch Maritime SORT (DMSORT) method for maritime MOT. The core of the\nframework is a parallel tracker with affine compensation, which incorporates an\nobject detection and re-identification (ReID) branch, along with a dedicated\nbranch for dynamic camera motion estimation. Specifically, a Reversible\nColumnar Detection Network (RCDN) is integrated into the detection module to\nleverage multi-level visual features for robust object detection. Furthermore,\na lightweight Transformer-based appearance extractor (Li-TAE) is designed to\ncapture global contextual information and generate robust appearance features.\nAnother branch decouples platform-induced and target-intrinsic motion by\nconstructing a projective transformation, applying platform-motion compensation\nwithin the Kalman filter, and thereby stabilizing true object trajectories.\nFinally, a clustering-optimized feature fusion module effectively combines\nmotion and appearance cues to ensure identity consistency under noise,\nocclusion, and drift. Extensive evaluations on the Singapore Maritime Dataset\ndemonstrate that DMSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, DMSORT\nattains the fastest runtime among existing ReID-based MOT frameworks while\nmaintaining high identity consistency and robustness to jitter and occlusion.\nCode is available at:\nhttps://github.com/BiscuitsLzy/DMSORT-An-efficient-parallel-maritime-multi-object-tracking-architecture-.", "AI": {"tldr": "DMSORT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u6d77\u4e0a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u5347\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d77\u4e0a\u73af\u5883\u5bfc\u81f4\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u51fa\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0eReID\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f30\u8ba1\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528RCDN\u548cLi-TAE\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u4f18\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u6d77\u4e8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u8fd0\u884c\u901f\u5ea6\u6700\u5feb\u4e14\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "DMSORT\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures\nthe hierarchical structure of viral evolution.\n  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and\ntemporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future\nSARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide\nmutations and 17.10\\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and\n6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability\nto aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and\n25A(LP.8.1).

While split computing\noffers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge\ndevices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique\nchallenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token\ngeneration process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work\nintroduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed\nexplicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key\ncontributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a\nmixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by\nstrategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with\ndifferent precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate\ncompression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise\nadaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations\nwhile dramatically reducing communication overhead.

In total, 3,529 offshore platforms were\ndetected, including 411 in the North Sea, 1,519 in the Gulf of Mexico, and\n1,593 in the Persian Gulf.

Addressing the lack of large-scale annotated\ndatasets, this paper introduces HideAndSeg, a novel, minimally supervised\nAI-based tool for segmenting videos of octopuses. It establishes a quantitative\nbaseline for this task. HideAndSeg integrates SAM2 with a custom-trained\nYOLOv11 object detector. First, the user provides point coordinates to generate\nthe initial segmentation masks with SAM2. These masks serve as training data\nfor the YOLO model. After that, our approach fully automates the pipeline by\nproviding a bounding box prompt to SAM2, eliminating the need for further\nmanual intervention. We introduce two unsupervised metrics - temporal\nconsistency $DICE_t$ and new component count $NC_t$ - to quantitatively\nevaluate segmentation quality and guide mask refinement in the absence of\nground-truth data, i.e., real-world information that serves to train, validate,\nand test AI models. Results show that HideAndSeg achieves satisfactory\nperformance, reducing segmentation noise compared to the manually prompted\napproach. Our method can re-identify and segment the octopus even after periods\nof complete occlusion in natural environments, a scenario in which the manually\nprompted model fails.

To this end, most existing works adopt the strategy\nof explicitly increasing the granularity of visual information processing,\ne.g., incorporating visual prompts to guide the model focus on specific local\nregions within the image. Meanwhile, researches on Multimodal Large Language\nModels(MLLMs) have demonstrated that training with long and detailed textual\ndescriptions can effectively improve the model's fine-grained vision-language\nalignment.

This issue is particularly severe in subpopulation shift scenarios,\nwhere models struggle in underrepresented groups. While existing methods have\nmade progress in mitigating this issue, their performance gains are still\nconstrained. They lack a rigorous theoretical framework connecting the\nembedding space representations with worst-group error. To address this\nlimitation, we propose Spurious Correlation-Aware Embedding Regularization for\nWorst-Group Robustness (SCER), a novel approach that directly regularizes\nfeature representations to suppress spurious cues. We show theoretically that\nworst-group error is influenced by how strongly the classifier relies on\nspurious versus core directions, identified from differences in group-wise mean\nembeddings across domains and classes. By imposing theoretical constraints at\nthe embedding level, SCER encourages models to focus on core features while\nreducing sensitivity to spurious patterns. Through systematic evaluation on\nmultiple vision and language, we show that SCER outperforms prior\nstate-of-the-art studies in worst-group accuracy.

Current benchmarks largely test only the early stages, offering\nnarrow coverage of spatial cognition and rarely challenging models in ways that\nrequire true world modeling. To drive progress in spatial supersensing, we\npresent VSI-SUPER, a two-part benchmark: VSR (long-horizon visual spatial\nrecall) and VSC (continual visual spatial counting).

Once a network has been trained, however, its\nmemory- and compute-footprint can be reduced by compression. In this work, we\nfocus on compression through tensorization and low-rank representations.\nWhereas classical approaches search for a low-rank approximation by minimizing\nan isotropic norm such as the Frobenius norm in weight-space, we use\ndata-informed norms that measure the error in function space. Concretely, we\nminimize the change in the layer's output distribution, which can be expressed\nas $\\lVert (W - \\widetilde{W}) \\Sigma^{1/2}\\rVert_F$ where $\\Sigma^{1/2}$ is\nthe square root of the covariance matrix of the layer's input and $W$,\n$\\widetilde{W}$ are the original and compressed weights. We propose new\nalternating least square algorithms for the two most common tensor\ndecompositions (Tucker-2 and CPD) that directly optimize the new norm. Unlike\nconventional compression pipelines, which almost always require\npost-compression fine-tuning, our data-informed approach often achieves\ncompetitive accuracy without any fine-tuning. We further show that the same\ncovariance-based norm can be transferred from one dataset to another with only\na minor accuracy drop, enabling compression even when the original training\ndataset is unavailable.

However, existing graph models for\nrelational data primarily focus on spatial structure, treating temporal\ninformation merely as a filtering constraint to exclude future events rather\nthan a modeling signal, and are typically designed for single-task prediction.\nTo address these gaps, we introduce a temporal subgraph sampler that enhances\nglobal context by retrieving nodes beyond the immediate neighborhood to capture\ntemporally relevant relationships. In addition, we propose the Relational Graph\nPerceiver (RGP), a graph transformer architecture for relational deep learning\nthat leverages a cross-attention-based latent bottleneck to efficiently\nintegrate information from both structural and temporal contexts. This latent\nbottleneck integrates signals from different node and edge types into a common\nlatent space, enabling the model to build global context across the entire\nrelational system.

Addressing this\nproblem requires a principled understanding of forgetting; yet, despite decades\nof study, no unified definition has emerged that provides insights into the\nunderlying dynamics of learning. We propose an algorithm- and task-agnostic\ntheory that characterises forgetting as a lack of self-consistency in a\nlearner's predictive distribution over future experiences, manifesting as a\nloss of predictive information. Our theory naturally yields a general measure\nof an algorithm's propensity to forget. To validate the theory, we design a\ncomprehensive set of experiments that span classification, regression,\ngenerative modelling, and reinforcement learning. We empirically demonstrate\nhow forgetting is present across all learning settings and plays a significant\nrole in determining learning efficiency.
