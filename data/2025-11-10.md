TL;DR: IndicVisionBench是第一个专注于印度次大陆的大规模多模态基准测试，涵盖英语和10种印度语言，包含3种多模态任务和13个文化主题，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在文化多样性环境中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数多模态评估基准都是西方中心的，缺乏对文化多样性和多语言环境的评估，因此需要建立针对印度次大陆的基准测试来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了包含约5K图像和37K+问答对的基准数据集，涵盖OCR、MMT和VQA三种多模态任务，涉及10种印度语言和13个文化主题，并评估了8种不同类型的视觉语言模型。

Result: 实验结果显示当前VLMs在文化多样性环境中存在显著的性能差距，暴露了模型在跨文化和多语言场景中的局限性。

Conclusion: IndicVisionBench为多模态研究建立了可复现的评估框架，通过关注文化多样性和多语言性，为构建更具包容性的多模态模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization
across multimodal tasks, yet most evaluation benchmarks remain Western-centric,
leaving open questions about their performance in culturally diverse and
multilingual settings. To address this gap, we introduce IndicVisionBench, the
first large-scale benchmark centered on the Indian subcontinent. Covering
English and 10 Indian languages, our benchmark spans 3 multimodal tasks,
including Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Multimodal Machine Translation
(MMT), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), covering 6 kinds of question types.
Our final benchmark consists of a total of ~5K images and 37K+ QA pairs across
13 culturally grounded topics. In addition, we release a paired parallel corpus
of annotations across 10 Indic languages, creating a unique resource for
analyzing cultural and linguistic biases in VLMs. We evaluate a broad spectrum
of 8 models, from proprietary closed-source systems to open-weights medium and
large-scale models. Our experiments reveal substantial performance gaps,
underscoring the limitations of current VLMs in culturally diverse contexts. By
centering cultural diversity and multilinguality, IndicVisionBench establishes
a reproducible evaluation framework that paves the way for more inclusive
multimodal research.

*Rucha Deshpande,Tahsin Rahman,Miguel Lago,Adarsh Subbaswamy,Jana G. Delfino,Ghada Zamzmi,Elim Thompson,Aldo Badano,Seyed Kahaki*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识的异常检测方法，用于检测合成图像中的网络诱导形状伪影，通过两阶段框架（特征提取器+隔离森林检测器）实现高精度检测，在合成乳腺X光数据集上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据在解决机器学习模型训练数据稀缺问题方面具有潜力，但未经质量评估的采用可能会引入影响模型性能和临床效用的伪影和失真。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）新颖的特征提取器，通过分析解剖边界角度梯度的每图像分布构建专用特征空间；2）基于隔离森林的异常检测器。

Result: 在两个合成乳腺X光数据集上AUC分别达到0.97和0.91，读者研究显示与人类评估者的一致性达66-68%，Kendall-Tau相关性为0.43-0.45。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了合成数据的负责任使用，使开发者能够根据已知解剖约束评估合成图像，定位并解决特定问题以提高合成数据集质量。

Abstract: Synthetic data provides a promising approach to address data scarcity for
training machine learning models; however, adoption without proper quality
assessments may introduce artifacts, distortions, and unrealistic features that
compromise model performance and clinical utility. This work introduces a novel
knowledge-based anomaly detection method for detecting network-induced shape
artifacts in synthetic images. The introduced method utilizes a two-stage
framework comprising (i) a novel feature extractor that constructs a
specialized feature space by analyzing the per-image distribution of angle
gradients along anatomical boundaries, and (ii) an isolation forest-based
anomaly detector. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for
identifying network-induced shape artifacts in two synthetic mammography
datasets from models trained on CSAW-M and VinDr-Mammo patient datasets
respectively. Quantitative evaluation shows that the method successfully
concentrates artifacts in the most anomalous partition (1st percentile), with
AUC values of 0.97 (CSAW-syn) and 0.91 (VMLO-syn). In addition, a reader study
involving three imaging scientists confirmed that images identified by the
method as containing network-induced shape artifacts were also flagged by human
readers with mean agreement rates of 66% (CSAW-syn) and 68% (VMLO-syn) for the
most anomalous partition, approximately 1.5-2 times higher than the least
anomalous partition. Kendall-Tau correlations between algorithmic and human
rankings were 0.45 and 0.43 for the two datasets, indicating reasonable
agreement despite the challenging nature of subtle artifact detection. This
method is a step forward in the responsible use of synthetic data, as it allows
developers to evaluate synthetic images for known anatomic constraints and
pinpoint and address specific issues to improve the overall quality of a
synthetic dataset.

### [3] [CPO: Condition Preference Optimization for Controllable Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04753)
*Zonglin Lyu,Ming Li,Xinxin Liu,Chen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Condition Preference Optimization (CPO)方法，通过直接在控制条件上进行偏好学习来提升文本到图像生成的可控性，相比ControlNet++和DPO方法具有更低的训练方差和更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet++仅优化低噪声时间步，忽略了高噪声时间步的贡献并引入近似误差；而DPO方法难以确保对比图像对仅在可控性上存在差异，其他因素如图像质量保持不变。

Method: 提出CPO方法，在控制信号而非生成图像上进行偏好学习。构建获胜和失败的控制信号对(c^w和c^l)，训练模型偏好c^w，从而消除混杂因素并获得低方差训练目标。

Result: 实验表明CPO在多个控制类型上显著优于最先进的ControlNet++：分割错误率降低超过10%，人体姿态错误率降低70-80%，边缘和深度图错误率持续降低2-5%。

Conclusion: CPO方法理论上展示出比DPO更低的对比损失方差，实证结果更优，且需要更少的计算和存储资源用于数据集构建，是提升文本到图像生成可控性的有效方法。

Abstract: To enhance controllability in text-to-image generation, ControlNet introduces
image-based control signals, while ControlNet++ improves pixel-level cycle
consistency between generated images and the input control signal. To avoid the
prohibitive cost of back-propagating through the sampling process, ControlNet++
optimizes only low-noise timesteps (e.g., $t < 200$) using a single-step
approximation, which not only ignores the contribution of high-noise timesteps
but also introduces additional approximation errors. A straightforward
alternative for optimizing controllability across all timesteps is Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), a fine-tuning method that increases model
preference for more controllable images ($I^{w}$) over less controllable ones
($I^{l}$). However, due to uncertainty in generative models, it is difficult to
ensure that win--lose image pairs differ only in controllability while keeping
other factors, such as image quality, fixed. To address this, we propose
performing preference learning over control conditions rather than generated
images. Specifically, we construct winning and losing control signals,
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$ and $\mathbf{c}^{l}$, and train the model to prefer
$\mathbf{c}^{w}$. This method, which we term \textit{Condition Preference
Optimization} (CPO), eliminates confounding factors and yields a low-variance
training objective. Our approach theoretically exhibits lower contrastive loss
variance than DPO and empirically achieves superior results. Moreover, CPO
requires less computation and storage for dataset curation. Extensive
experiments show that CPO significantly improves controllability over the
state-of-the-art ControlNet++ across multiple control types: over $10\%$ error
rate reduction in segmentation, $70$--$80\%$ in human pose, and consistent
$2$--$5\%$ reductions in edge and depth maps.

### [4] [DARN: Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks for Efficient and Robust Foundation Model Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04766)
*Dhenenjay Yadav,Rohan Sawai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DARN提出了一种动态自适应正则化网络，通过任务复杂度预测和自适应正则化机制，有效解决了地理空间分析中基础模型适应卫星图像异质性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准适应方法使用固定正则化策略，无法处理卫星图像的显著异质性，限制了基础模型在地理空间分析中的有效应用。

Method: DARN包含三个核心创新：任务复杂度预测器、自适应dropout调制和动态容量门控，能够根据样本复杂度动态调整正则化策略。

Result: 在GeoBench基准测试中达到86.66% mIoU（提升5.56个百分点），在Sen1Floods11上达到90.5% mIoU，同时在OOD泛化、鲁棒性和少数类性能方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: DARN为地理空间应用提供了更智能、鲁棒和高效的基础模型适应方法，具有重要的实际部署价值。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) offer powerful representations for geospatial
analysis, but adapting them effectively remains challenging. Standard
adaptation methods, whether full fine-tuning or efficient frozen-backbone
approaches, typically employ decoders with fixed regularization strategies,
failing to account for the significant heterogeneity in satellite imagery. We
introduce Dynamic Adaptive Regularization Networks (DARN), a novel decoder
architecture designed to address this limitation. DARN integrates three key
innovations: (1) a lightweight Task Complexity Predictor (TCP) that estimates
per-sample difficulty, (2) Adaptive Dropout Modulation (ADM), dynamically
adjusting dropout rates (from 0.1 to 0.5) based on predicted complexity, and
(3) Dynamic Capacity Gating (DCG) that modulates channel activation. We provide
theoretical justifications linking DARN's optimization to stationary point
convergence and its mechanism to adaptive information bottlenecks. Empirically,
DARN demonstrates exceptional performance across both major adaptation
paradigms. In full fine-tuning (unfrozen backbone), DARN achieves a new
state-of-the-art on the multi-task GeoBench benchmark (86.66% mIoU, +5.56 pp
over prior SOTA). In efficient adaptation (frozen backbone), DARN achieves
SOTA-competitive accuracy (90.5% mIoU on Sen1Floods11) while delivering
substantial advantages crucial for real-world deployment: superior
out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization (+9.5 pp mIoU on AI4SmallFarms),
enhanced robustness (17% relative reduction in corruption error), and improved
performance on minority classes. DARN offers a more intelligent, robust, and
efficient approach to leveraging FMs in critical geospatial applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于预训练-微调框架的机器学习方法，首次实现从2D卫星图像生成全球瞬时3D云图，特别是能准确重建强烈热带气旋的3D结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热带气旋预报面临卫星观测数据有限和云属性解析困难等挑战，现有方法在TC常见区域表现不佳且对强风暴验证不足

Method: 采用预训练-微调管道，利用多卫星全球覆盖数据，将2D卫星图像转换为相关云属性的3D云图，并在定制TC数据集上评估性能

Result: 能够准确重建强烈风暴的3D结构，不仅扩展了可用卫星观测数据，还能在观测完全缺失时提供估计

Conclusion: 该方法对于增进对TC强度变化的理解和改善预报至关重要

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to
limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in
resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has
demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud
reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have
been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for
intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a
pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with
global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of
relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to
evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show
that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps
and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not
only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when
observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our
understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.

*Andrea Aspesi,Andrea Simpsi,Aaron Tognoli,Simone Mentasti,Luca Merigo,Matteo Matteucci*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EETnet是一个基于事件相机的眼动追踪卷积神经网络，专门设计用于在资源受限的微控制器上运行，包含分类和回归两种架构版本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于事件相机的眼动追踪解决方案大多依赖强大GPU，无法在实际嵌入式设备上部署，需要开发能在资源受限微控制器上运行的高效算法。

Method: 设计专门用于纯事件数据的卷积神经网络EETnet，提出训练、评估和量化方法，包含两种架构：基于网格分类的瞳孔检测模型和像素级回归模型。

Result: 开发出能在微控制器上运行的EETnet网络，利用公共数据集进行训练和量化，成功实现嵌入式设备上的眼动追踪。

Conclusion: EETnet证明了基于事件相机的眼动追踪算法可以在资源受限的嵌入式设备上有效部署，为低功耗实时眼动追踪应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are becoming a popular solution for efficient, low-power
eye tracking. Due to the sparse and asynchronous nature of event data, they
require less processing power and offer latencies in the microsecond range.
However, many existing solutions are limited to validation on powerful GPUs,
with no deployment on real embedded devices. In this paper, we present EETnet,
a convolutional neural network designed for eye tracking using purely
event-based data, capable of running on microcontrollers with limited
resources. Additionally, we outline a methodology to train, evaluate, and
quantize the network using a public dataset. Finally, we propose two versions
of the architecture: a classification model that detects the pupil on a grid
superimposed on the original image, and a regression model that operates at the
pixel level.

*Jim James,Ben Wilson,Simon Lucey,James Hays*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出3D高斯点编码器，一种基于3D高斯混合的显式几何表示方法，相比传统PointNet更高效快速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D识别任务主要使用隐式表示如PointNet，但显式几何表示在3D重建领域已证明优势，希望将这一优势扩展到3D识别任务

Method: 开发基于自然梯度和PointNet蒸馏的优化技术，学习高斯基函数来重构PointNet激活，并应用3D高斯泼溅的过滤技术加速

Result: 编码器运行速度比PointNet快2.7倍，内存减少46%，FLOPs减少88%；在Mamba3D中速度提升1.27倍，内存和FLOPs分别减少42%和54%

Conclusion: 3D高斯点编码器是轻量级高效的3D表示方法，能在仅CPU设备上实现高帧率

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the 3D Gaussian Point Encoder, an explicit
per-point embedding built on mixtures of learned 3D Gaussians. This explicit
geometric representation for 3D recognition tasks is a departure from widely
used implicit representations such as PointNet. However, it is difficult to
learn 3D Gaussian encoders in end-to-end fashion with standard optimizers. We
develop optimization techniques based on natural gradients and distillation
from PointNets to find a Gaussian Basis that can reconstruct PointNet
activations. The resulting 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are faster and more
parameter efficient than traditional PointNets. As in the 3D reconstruction
literature where there has been considerable interest in the move from implicit
(e.g., NeRF) to explicit (e.g., Gaussian Splatting) representations, we can
take advantage of computational geometry heuristics to accelerate 3D Gaussian
Point Encoders further. We extend filtering techniques from 3D Gaussian
Splatting to construct encoders that run 2.7 times faster as a comparable
accuracy PointNet while using 46% less memory and 88% fewer FLOPs. Furthermore,
we demonstrate the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian Point Encoders as a component
in Mamba3D, running 1.27 times faster and achieving a reduction in memory and
FLOPs by 42% and 54% respectively. 3D Gaussian Point Encoders are lightweight
enough to achieve high framerates on CPU-only devices.

### [8] [Data Efficiency and Transfer Robustness in Biomedical Image Segmentation: A Study of Redundancy and Forgetting with Cellpose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04803)
*Shuo Zhao,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过Cellpose案例发现：1）生物医学图像分割存在显著数据冗余，仅需10%数据即可达到饱和性能；2）跨域微调会导致严重遗忘，但选择性重放5-10%源数据可有效恢复源域性能；3）训练域排序策略能改善泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索生物医学图像分割中两个关键挑战：训练数据冗余程度和跨域迁移对模型保留能力的影响。

Method: 提出数据集量化(DQ)策略构建紧凑训练子集；使用MAE嵌入和t-SNE进行潜在空间分析；进行跨域微调实验和选择性重放策略测试。

Result: 图像分割性能在10%数据时达到饱和；选择性重放5-10%源数据可恢复源域性能；训练域排序改善泛化并减少遗忘。

Conclusion: 生物医学图像分割需要数据中心化设计，高效训练不仅需要紧凑子集，还需要保留感知学习策略和明智的域排序。

Abstract: Generalist biomedical image segmentation models such as Cellpose are
increasingly applied across diverse imaging modalities and cell types. However,
two critical challenges remain underexplored: (1) the extent of training data
redundancy and (2) the impact of cross domain transfer on model retention. In
this study, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these challenges
using Cellpose as a case study. First, to assess data redundancy, we propose a
simple dataset quantization (DQ) strategy for constructing compact yet diverse
training subsets. Experiments on the Cyto dataset show that image segmentation
performance saturates with only 10% of the data, revealing substantial
redundancy and potential for training with minimal annotations. Latent space
analysis using MAE embeddings and t-SNE confirms that DQ selected patches
capture greater feature diversity than random sampling. Second, to examine
catastrophic forgetting, we perform cross domain finetuning experiments and
observe significant degradation in source domain performance, particularly when
adapting from generalist to specialist domains. We demonstrate that selective
DQ based replay reintroducing just 5-10% of the source data effectively
restores source performance, while full replay can hinder target adaptation.
Additionally, we find that training domain sequencing improves generalization
and reduces forgetting in multi stage transfer. Our findings highlight the
importance of data centric design in biomedical image segmentation and suggest
that efficient training requires not only compact subsets but also retention
aware learning strategies and informed domain ordering. The code is available
at https://github.com/MMV-Lab/biomedseg-efficiency.

### [9] [An Active Learning Pipeline for Biomedical Image Instance Segmentation with Minimal Human Intervention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04811)
*Shuo Zhao,Yu Zhou,Jianxu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合基础模型和主动学习的数据中心AI工作流，用于生物医学图像分割，显著减少人工标注需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决nnU-Net需要大量标注数据进行交叉验证的局限性，以及基础模型在特定数据集上性能不足的问题

Method: 使用基础模型生成伪标签，通过主动学习选择代表性样本进行最小化人工标注，然后微调nnU-Net模型

Result: 该方法显著减少了手动标注需求，同时保持了有竞争力的分割性能

Conclusion: 为生物医学研究人员提供了一个可访问的解决方案，能够在分割任务中应用最先进的AI技术

Abstract: Biomedical image segmentation is critical for precise structure delineation
and downstream analysis. Traditional methods often struggle with noisy data,
while deep learning models such as U-Net have set new benchmarks in
segmentation performance. nnU-Net further automates model configuration, making
it adaptable across datasets without extensive tuning. However, it requires a
substantial amount of annotated data for cross-validation, posing a challenge
when only raw images but no labels are available. Large foundation models offer
zero-shot generalizability, but may underperform on specific datasets with
unique characteristics, limiting their direct use for analysis. This work
addresses these bottlenecks by proposing a data-centric AI workflow that
leverages active learning and pseudo-labeling to combine the strengths of
traditional neural networks and large foundation models while minimizing human
intervention. The pipeline starts by generating pseudo-labels from a foundation
model, which are then used for nnU-Net's self-configuration. Subsequently, a
representative core-set is selected for minimal manual annotation, enabling
effective fine-tuning of the nnU-Net model. This approach significantly reduces
the need for manual annotations while maintaining competitive performance,
providing an accessible solution for biomedical researchers to apply
state-of-the-art AI techniques in their segmentation tasks. The code is

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于表面法向量先验知识的几何去噪新方法，通过标签向量集进行自然分割，并使用总变分正则化和分裂Bregman算法求解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用表面法向量的先验知识来改进几何去噪效果，将分割问题自然地嵌入到去噪过程中。

Method: 基于标签向量集的法向量相似性进行分割，采用总变分正则化，使用分裂Bregman（ADMM）算法求解优化问题，顶点更新基于二阶形状计算。

Result: 提出了一种结合几何分割的去噪框架，能够有效利用法向量先验知识。

Conclusion: 该方法为几何去噪提供了一种新的范式，通过整合分割和正则化实现了更好的去噪效果。

Abstract: We introduce a new paradigm for geometry denoising using prior knowledge
about the surface normal vector. This prior knowledge comes in the form of a
set of preferred normal vectors, which we refer to as label vectors. A
segmentation problem is naturally embedded in the denoising process. The
segmentation is based on the similarity of the normal vector to the elements of
the set of label vectors. Regularization is achieved by a total variation term.
We formulate a split Bregman (ADMM) approach to solve the resulting
optimization problem. The vertex update step is based on second-order shape
calculus.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种从点云中学习形状特定先验的隐式自先验方法，通过联合训练可学习嵌入字典和隐式距离场，无需外部训练数据即可恢复高质量表面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不规则点云恢复高质量表面是病态问题，需要强几何先验。传统方法依赖外部训练数据，而本文旨在直接从输入点云本身提取先验知识。

Method: 使用隐式自先验方法：1）联合训练可学习嵌入字典和隐式距离场；2）通过交叉注意力机制捕获重复结构和长程相关性；3）结合RIMLS公式集成密集点云和法向量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在生成高保真表面方面优于传统和基于学习的方法，具有更好的细节保持能力和对数据退化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了无需外部数据的自监督表面重建，在稀疏区域正则化和细节保持方面表现出色，为点云表面重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recovering high-quality surfaces from irregular point cloud is ill-posed
unless strong geometric priors are available. We introduce an implicit
self-prior approach that distills a shape-specific prior directly from the
input point cloud itself and embeds it within an implicit neural
representation. This is achieved by jointly training a small dictionary of
learnable embeddings with an implicit distance field; at every query location,
the field attends to the dictionary via cross-attention, enabling the network
to capture and reuse repeating structures and long-range correlations inherent
to the shape. Optimized solely with self-supervised point cloud reconstruction
losses, our approach requires no external training data. To effectively
integrate this learned prior while preserving input fidelity, the trained field
is then sampled to extract densely distributed points and analytic normals via
automatic differentiation. We integrate the resulting dense point cloud and
corresponding normals into a robust implicit moving least squares (RIMLS)
formulation. We show this hybrid strategy preserves fine geometric details in
the input data, while leveraging the learned prior to regularize sparse
regions. Experiments show that our method outperforms both classical and
learning-based approaches in generating high-fidelity surfaces with superior
detail preservation and robustness to common data degradations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Clinical-ComBAT方法，用于解决DW-MRI数据跨站点扫描仪偏差问题，相比传统ComBAT方法更适合临床场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ComBAT方法存在线性协变量关系、同质人群、固定站点数量等限制，不适合临床实际应用

Method: Clinical-ComBAT采用非线性多项式数据模型、基于规范站点的站点特异性协调、适用于小队列的方差先验，以及超参数调整和拟合优度评估

Result: 在模拟和真实数据上验证了方法的有效性，显示扩散指标对齐效果改善，更适合规范建模应用

Conclusion: Clinical-ComBAT为临床环境提供了更灵活、实用的DW-MRI数据协调解决方案

Abstract: Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DW-MRI) derived scalar maps
are effective for assessing neurodegenerative diseases and microstructural
properties of white matter in large number of brain conditions. However, DW-MRI
inherently limits the combination of data from multiple acquisition sites
without harmonization to mitigate scanner-specific biases. While the widely
used ComBAT method reduces site effects in research, its reliance on linear
covariate relationships, homogeneous populations, fixed site numbers, and well
populated sites constrains its clinical use. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Clinical-ComBAT, a method designed for real-world clinical scenarios.
Clinical-ComBAT harmonizes each site independently, enabling flexibility as new
data and clinics are introduced. It incorporates a non-linear polynomial data
model, site-specific harmonization referenced to a normative site, and variance
priors adaptable to small cohorts. It further includes hyperparameter tuning
and a goodness-of-fit metric for harmonization assessment. We demonstrate its
effectiveness on simulated and real data, showing improved alignment of
diffusion metrics and enhanced applicability for normative modeling.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了Swin视觉变换器模型在耳部疾病诊断中的效果，发现初始结果优异但存在数据泄露问题，修正后性能显著下降，强调数据预处理的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于耳鼻喉专科医生存在27%的误诊率，需要提高耳部疾病诊断的准确性，探索视觉变换器模型在医学图像诊断中的应用潜力。

Method: 使用智利大学临床医院耳鼻喉科的真实耳镜视频数据集，基于拉普拉斯和香农熵阈值筛选帧，比较Swin v1、Swin v2变换器模型与ResNet卷积神经网络的表现。

Result: 初始结果显示Swin v1准确率100%，Swin v2准确率99.1%，ResNet准确率99.5%，但发现数据泄露问题。修正后Swin v1和v2准确率降至83%，ResNet降至82%。

Conclusion: 视觉变换器模型有潜力，但必须在先进模型架构和有效数据预处理之间找到平衡，这对开发可靠的耳部疾病诊断机器学习模型至关重要。

Abstract: This study evaluates the efficacy of vision transformer models, specifically
Swin transformers, in enhancing the diagnostic accuracy of ear diseases
compared to traditional convolutional neural networks. With a reported 27%
misdiagnosis rate among specialist otolaryngologists, improving diagnostic
accuracy is crucial. The research utilised a real-world dataset from the
Department of Otolaryngology at the Clinical Hospital of the Universidad de
Chile, comprising otoscopic videos of ear examinations depicting various middle
and external ear conditions. Frames were selected based on the Laplacian and
Shannon entropy thresholds, with blank frames removed. Initially, Swin v1 and
Swin v2 transformer models achieved accuracies of 100% and 99.1%, respectively,
marginally outperforming the ResNet model (99.5%). These results surpassed
metrics reported in related studies. However, the evaluation uncovered a
critical data leakage issue in the preprocessing step, affecting both this
study and related research using the same raw dataset. After mitigating the
data leakage, model performance decreased significantly. Corrected accuracies
were 83% for both Swin v1 and Swin v2, and 82% for the ResNet model. This
finding highlights the importance of rigorous data handling in machine learning
studies, especially in medical applications. The findings indicate that while
vision transformers show promise, it is essential to find an optimal balance
between the benefits of advanced model architectures and those derived from
effective data preprocessing. This balance is key to developing a reliable
machine learning model for diagnosing ear diseases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用卫星图像进行致命交通事故风险评估的地理空间深度学习框架，通过生成Beta概率分布来提供不确定性感知的预测，相比基线方法在召回率上提升17-23%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统交通安全研究往往孤立分析风险因素，忽略了空间复杂性；传统神经网络风险估计器仅提供点估计而缺乏不确定性信息，限制了在关键决策中的应用。

Method: 使用卫星图像作为综合空间输入，构建地理空间深度学习框架，模型估计致命碰撞风险的完整Beta概率分布而非单一确定性输出。

Result: 模型在召回率这一关键指标上比基线方法提升17-23%，同时具有更好的校准性能，能够为自动驾驶和城市规划提供可靠的风险评估。

Conclusion: 该方法通过卫星图像提供可靠且可解释的风险评估，为自动驾驶安全导航和城市规划者提供了高度可扩展的工具，能够以公平且成本效益高的方式提升道路安全。

Abstract: Roadway traffic accidents represent a global health crisis, responsible for
over a million deaths annually and costing many countries up to 3% of their
GDP. Traditional traffic safety studies often examine risk factors in
isolation, overlooking the spatial complexity and contextual interactions
inherent in the built environment. Furthermore, conventional Neural
Network-based risk estimators typically generate point estimates without
conveying model uncertainty, limiting their utility in critical
decision-making. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a novel geospatial
deep learning framework that leverages satellite imagery as a comprehensive
spatial input. This approach enables the model to capture the nuanced spatial
patterns and embedded environmental risk factors that contribute to fatal crash
risks. Rather than producing a single deterministic output, our model estimates
a full Beta probability distribution over fatal crash risk, yielding accurate
and uncertainty-aware predictions--a critical feature for trustworthy AI in
safety-critical applications. Our model outperforms baselines by achieving a
17-23% improvement in recall, a key metric for flagging potential dangers,
while delivering superior calibration. By providing reliable and interpretable
risk assessments from satellite imagery alone, our method enables safer
autonomous navigation and offers a highly scalable tool for urban planners and
policymakers to enhance roadway safety equitably and cost-effectively.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应多退化图像恢复网络IMDNet，通过解耦退化成分来指导路径选择，能够同时处理多种共存退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像往往同时存在多种退化（如雨、噪声、雾霾），而现有方法大多只针对单一退化类型，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 设计了退化成分解耦块(DIDBlock)在编码器中分离退化成分，融合块(FBlock)整合多层级退化信息，任务适应块(TABlock)在解码器中动态选择最优恢复路径。

Result: 实验验证表明IMDNet在多退化恢复任务上表现优异，同时在单退化任务上保持强大竞争力。

Conclusion: IMDNet通过紧密集成的架构有效解决了多退化图像恢复问题，为复杂现实场景的图像恢复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Image restoration (IR) aims to recover clean images from degraded
observations. Despite remarkable progress, most existing methods focus on a
single degradation type, whereas real-world images often suffer from multiple
coexisting degradations, such as rain, noise, and haze coexisting in a single
image, which limits their practical effectiveness. In this paper, we propose an
adaptive multi-degradation image restoration network that reconstructs images
by leveraging decoupled representations of degradation ingredients to guide
path selection. Specifically, we design a degradation ingredient decoupling
block (DIDBlock) in the encoder to separate degradation ingredients
statistically by integrating spatial and frequency domain information,
enhancing the recognition of multiple degradation types and making their
feature representations independent. In addition, we present fusion block
(FBlock) to integrate degradation information across all levels using learnable
matrices. In the decoder, we further introduce a task adaptation block
(TABlock) that dynamically activates or fuses functional branches based on the
multi-degradation representation, flexibly selecting optimal restoration paths
under diverse degradation conditions. The resulting tightly integrated
architecture, termed IMDNet, is extensively validated through experiments,
showing superior performance on multi-degradation restoration while maintaining
strong competitiveness on single-degradation tasks.

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence in oral healthcare relies on the
availability of large-scale multimodal datasets that capture the complexity of
clinical practice. In this paper, we present a comprehensive multimodal
dataset, comprising 8775 dental checkups from 4800 patients collected over
eight years (2018-2025), with patients ranging from 10 to 90 years of age. The
dataset includes 50000 intraoral images, 8056 radiographs, and detailed textual

were collected under standard ethical guidelines and annotated for
benchmarking. To demonstrate its utility, we fine-tuned state-of-the-art large
vision-language models, Qwen-VL 3B and 7B, and evaluated them on two tasks:
classification of six oro-dental anomalies and generation of complete
diagnostic reports from multimodal inputs. We compared the fine-tuned models
with their base counterparts and GPT-4o. The fine-tuned models achieved
substantial gains over these baselines, validating the dataset and underscoring
its effectiveness in advancing AI-driven oro-dental healthcare solutions. The
dataset is publicly available, providing an essential resource for future

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于高维潜在空间表示和多智能体对抗强化学习的新型深度学习框架，用于开发鲁棒且自适应的水印方法，以应对深度伪造检测的挑战。

Method: 开发了在潜在空间操作的可学习水印嵌入器，利用MAARL范式让水印智能体与对抗攻击智能体交互，在良性扭曲和恶意篡改之间寻求最优平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架通过高维语义表示和对抗学习机制，成功解决了深度伪造水印检测中鲁棒性与敏感性的平衡问题，为主动深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射技术在渲染大型或复杂场景时面临GPU内存不足的挑战，限制了其在消费级硬件上的应用。

Method: 利用3DGS内存访问模式的观察结果，采用流水线化技术重叠GPU-CPU通信、GPU计算和CPU计算，同时减少通信量。

Result: 在单张RTX4090上成功渲染需要1亿个高斯分布的大型场景，并达到最先进的重建质量。

Conclusion: CLM系统有效解决了3DGS在大场景渲染中的内存限制问题，使其能够在消费级GPU上实现高质量渲染。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is an increasingly popular novel view synthesis
approach due to its fast rendering time, and high-quality output. However,
scaling 3DGS to large (or intricate) scenes is challenging due to its large
memory requirement, which exceed most GPU's memory capacity. In this paper, we
describe CLM, a system that allows 3DGS to render large scenes using a single
consumer-grade GPU, e.g., RTX4090. It does so by offloading Gaussians to CPU
memory, and loading them into GPU memory only when necessary. To reduce
performance and communication overheads, CLM uses a novel offloading strategy
that exploits observations about 3DGS's memory access pattern for pipelining,
and thus overlap GPU-to-CPU communication, GPU computation and CPU computation.
Furthermore, we also exploit observation about the access pattern to reduce
communication volume. Our evaluation shows that the resulting implementation
can render a large scene that requires 100 million Gaussians on a single
RTX4090 and achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI和dMRI在神经退行性疾病研究中因模态缺失导致的临床应用障碍，特别是处理BOLD信号与扩散加权信号在时间/梯度轴上的显著差异以及疾病相关神经解剖模式整合不足的问题。

Method: 提出PDS方法，包含两个关键创新：(1)模式感知双模态3D扩散框架进行跨模态学习；(2)集成高效微结构细化的组织细化网络，保持结构保真度和细节。

Result: 在OASIS-3、ADNI和内部数据集上评估，fMRI合成PSNR/SSIM为29.83 dB/90.84%（比基线提升1.54 dB/4.12%），dMRI合成PSNR/SSIM为30.00 dB/77.55%（提升1.02 dB/2.2%）。临床验证中合成数据在NC vs. MCI vs. AD分类中达到67.92%/66.02%/64.15%准确率。

Conclusion: PDS方法有效解决了fMRI-dMRI合成中的挑战，在模态完成和临床诊断方面表现出色，为神经退行性疾病研究提供了可靠的工具。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), especially functional MRI (fMRI) and
diffusion MRI (dMRI), is essential for studying neurodegenerative diseases.
However, missing modalities pose a major barrier to their clinical use.
Although GAN- and diffusion model-based approaches have shown some promise in
modality completion, they remain limited in fMRI-dMRI synthesis due to (1)
significant BOLD vs. diffusion-weighted signal differences between fMRI and
dMRI in time/gradient axis, and (2) inadequate integration of disease-related
neuroanatomical patterns during generation. To address these challenges, we
propose PDS, introducing two key innovations: (1) a pattern-aware dual-modal 3D
diffusion framework for cross-modality learning, and (2) a tissue refinement
network integrated with a efficient microstructure refinement to maintain
structural fidelity and fine details. Evaluated on OASIS-3, ADNI, and in-house
datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art results, with PSNR/SSIM scores
of 29.83 dB/90.84\% for fMRI synthesis (+1.54 dB/+4.12\% over baselines) and
30.00 dB/77.55\% for dMRI synthesis (+1.02 dB/+2.2\%). In clinical validation,
the synthesized data show strong diagnostic performance, achieving
67.92\%/66.02\%/64.15\% accuracy (NC vs. MCI vs. AD) in hybrid real-synthetic
experiments. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/SXR3015/PDS}{PDS

Motivation: 深度神经网络研究主要集中在纹理特征上，而对几何形状的理解能力缺乏系统探索。论文旨在填补这一空白，探究DNNs对几何信息的处理能力。

Method: 采用端到端可微分框架，结合傅里叶级数参数化形状、基于绕组数的像素网格映射方法，以及信号能量约束来确保物理上合理的形状优化。

Result: 1) 优化形状可作为高置信度分类的语义载体；2) 是精确识别模型显著区域的可解释性工具；3) 构成可欺骗下游视觉任务的新型对抗攻击范式。

Conclusion: 该工作为探索DNNs的几何世界提供了通用框架，为挑战和理解机器感知开辟了新前沿。

Abstract: While both shape and texture are fundamental to visual recognition, research
on deep neural networks (DNNs) has predominantly focused on the latter, leaving
their geometric understanding poorly probed. Here, we show: first, that
optimized shapes can act as potent semantic carriers, generating
high-confidence classifications from inputs defined purely by their geometry;
second, that they are high-fidelity interpretability tools that precisely
isolate a model's salient regions; and third, that they constitute a new,
generalizable adversarial paradigm capable of deceiving downstream visual
tasks. This is achieved through an end-to-end differentiable framework that
unifies a powerful Fourier series to parameterize arbitrary shapes, a winding
number-based mapping to translate them into the pixel grid required by DNNs,
and signal energy constraints that enhance optimization efficiency while
ensuring physically plausible shapes. Our work provides a versatile framework
for probing the geometric world of DNNs and opens new frontiers for challenging
and understanding machine perception.

Motivation: 传统拓扑数据分析方法如持久同调计算成本高，而神经网络估计器的发展受到缺乏专门针对TDA任务的带标签3D数据集的限制，需要具有适当类别分布和多样性的数据。

Method: 使用排斥表面算法系统生成带标签的3D数据集，可控制拓扑不变量（如孔洞数量），并采用3D卷积变换器架构训练属估计器网络。

Result: 生成的3D数据集提供了具有拓扑标签的多样化几何形状，可用于训练和基准测试神经网络估计器。实验观察到随着变形增加，估计器准确性下降，表明几何复杂性对泛化能力的影响。

Conclusion: 该数据集填补了用于TDA模型和技术训练评估的标记3D数据集的空白，强调了拓扑复杂性和几何复杂性在训练泛化估计器中的重要性。

Abstract: Topological Data Analysis (TDA) involves techniques of analyzing the
underlying structure and connectivity of data. However, traditional methods
like persistent homology can be computationally demanding, motivating the
development of neural network-based estimators capable of reducing
computational overhead and inference time. A key barrier to advancing these
methods is the lack of labeled 3D data with class distributions and diversity
tailored specifically for supervised learning in TDA tasks. To address this, we
introduce a novel approach for systematically generating labeled 3D datasets
using the Repulsive Surface algorithm, allowing control over topological
invariants, such as hole count. The resulting dataset offers varied geometry
with topological labeling, making it suitable for training and benchmarking
neural network estimators. This paper uses a synthetic 3D dataset to train a
genus estimator network, created using a 3D convolutional transformer
architecture. An observed decrease in accuracy as deformations increase
highlights the role of not just topological complexity, but also geometric
complexity, when training generalized estimators. This dataset fills a gap in
labeled 3D datasets and generation for training and evaluating models and
techniques for TDA.

Conclusion: 通过发布Triple-S和GSE，为贴纸理解、检索和多模态内容生成的未来研究提供了标准化评估工具和鲁棒嵌入表示。

Abstract: Stickers have become a popular form of visual communication, yet
understanding their semantic relationships remains challenging due to their
highly diverse and symbolic content. In this work, we formally {define the
Sticker Semantic Similarity task} and introduce {Triple-S}, the first benchmark
for this task, consisting of 905 human-annotated positive and negative sticker
pairs. Through extensive evaluation, we show that existing pretrained vision
and multimodal models struggle to capture nuanced sticker semantics. To address
this, we propose the {General Sticker Encoder (GSE)}, a lightweight and
versatile model that learns robust sticker embeddings using both Triple-S and
additional datasets. GSE achieves superior performance on unseen stickers, and
demonstrates strong results on downstream tasks such as emotion classification
and sticker-to-sticker retrieval. By releasing both Triple-S and GSE, we
provide standardized evaluation tools and robust embeddings, enabling future
research in sticker understanding, retrieval, and multimodal content
generation. The Triple-S benchmark and GSE have been publicly released and are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LVLM架构存在固有的语言模态偏向，这主要是由于常见的做法只是简单地将视觉嵌入附加到输入文本序列中。这种不平衡导致了视觉定位能力不足和幻觉问题。

Method: 提出了一种简单有效的方法，通过集成平均池化的视觉特征来细化文本嵌入。这种方法提供了直接、鲁棒且高效的方式来融合视觉信息。

Result: 该方法在已建立的基准测试中显著改善了视觉定位能力，并显著减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 虽然平均池化是一个有效的解决方案，但更复杂的融合方法可能进一步增强视觉定位和跨模态对齐。本文主要关注揭示模态不平衡问题及其影响，并将更先进的融合策略探索留给未来工作。

Abstract: In this work, we identify an inherent bias in prevailing LVLM architectures
toward the language modality, largely resulting from the common practice of
simply appending visual embeddings to the input text sequence. To address this,
we propose a simple yet effective method that refines textual embeddings by
integrating average-pooled visual features. Our approach demonstrably improves
visual grounding and significantly reduces hallucinations on established
benchmarks. While average pooling offers a straightforward, robust, and
efficient means of incorporating visual information, we believe that more
sophisticated fusion methods could further enhance visual grounding and
cross-modal alignment. Given that the primary focus of this work is to
highlight the modality imbalance and its impact on hallucinations -- and to
show that refining textual embeddings with visual information mitigates this
issue -- we leave exploration of advanced fusion strategies for future work.

Result: 在癌症亚型分类、癌症识别和突变预测任务上的实验证明了DRE-SLCL方法的有效性

Conclusion: DRE-SLCL方法成功解决了WSI端到端表示学习中的计算挑战，为病理图像分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) representation is critical for cancer subtyping,
cancer recognition and mutation prediction.Training an end-to-end WSI
representation model poses significant challenges, as a standard gigapixel
slide can contain tens of thousands of image tiles, making it difficult to
compute gradients of all tiles in a single mini-batch due to current GPU
limitations. To address this challenge, we propose a method of dynamic residual
encoding with slide-level contrastive learning (DRE-SLCL) for end-to-end WSI
representation. Our approach utilizes a memory bank to store the features of
tiles across all WSIs in the dataset. During training, a mini-batch usually
contains multiple WSIs. For each WSI in the batch, a subset of tiles is
randomly sampled and their features are computed using a tile encoder. Then,
additional tile features from the same WSI are selected from the memory bank.
The representation of each individual WSI is generated using a residual
encoding technique that incorporates both the sampled features and those
retrieved from the memory bank. Finally, the slide-level contrastive loss is
computed based on the representations and histopathology reports ofthe WSIs
within the mini-batch. Experiments conducted over cancer subtyping, cancer
recognition, and mutation prediction tasks proved the effectiveness of the
proposed DRE-SLCL method.

Method: 采用双级特征提取器解析压力数据，结合分层扩散模型，利用压力序列的物理线索和文本提示的语义指导来生成精确的运动。

Conclusion: Pressure2Motion是首个结合压力数据和语言先验的运动生成方法，建立的MPL基准是该任务的第一个基准，代码和基准将在发表后公开。

Abstract: We present Pressure2Motion, a novel motion capture algorithm that synthesizes
human motion from a ground pressure sequence and text prompt. It eliminates the
need for specialized lighting setups, cameras, or wearable devices, making it
suitable for privacy-preserving, low-light, and low-cost motion capture
scenarios. Such a task is severely ill-posed due to the indeterminate nature of
the pressure signals to full-body motion. To address this issue, we introduce
Pressure2Motion, a generative model that leverages pressure features as input
and utilizes a text prompt as a high-level guiding constraint. Specifically,
our model utilizes a dual-level feature extractor that accurately interprets
pressure data, followed by a hierarchical diffusion model that discerns
broad-scale movement trajectories and subtle posture adjustments. Both the
physical cues gained from the pressure sequence and the semantic guidance
derived from descriptive texts are leveraged to guide the motion generation
with precision. To the best of our knowledge, Pressure2Motion is a pioneering
work in leveraging both pressure data and linguistic priors for motion
generation, and the established MPL benchmark is the first benchmark for this
task. Experiments show our method generates high-fidelity, physically plausible
motions, establishing a new state-of-the-art for this task. The codes and
benchmarks will be publicly released upon publication.

Conclusion: 该框架为传统MRIS流程提供了简化且有效的替代方案，支持端到端训练并利用了预训练多模态模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Medical Referring Image Segmentation (MRIS) involves segmenting target
regions in medical images based on natural language descriptions. While
achieving promising results, recent approaches usually involve complex design
of multimodal fusion or multi-stage decoders. In this work, we propose
NTP-MRISeg, a novel framework that reformulates MRIS as an autoregressive
next-token prediction task over a unified multimodal sequence of tokenized
image, text, and mask representations. This formulation streamlines model
design by eliminating the need for modality-specific fusion and external
segmentation models, supports a unified architecture for end-to-end training.
It also enables the use of pretrained tokenizers from emerging large-scale
multimodal models, enhancing generalization and adaptability. More importantly,
to address challenges under this formulation-such as exposure bias, long-tail
token distributions, and fine-grained lesion edges-we propose three novel
strategies: (1) a Next-k Token Prediction (NkTP) scheme to reduce cumulative
prediction errors, (2) Token-level Contrastive Learning (TCL) to enhance
boundary sensitivity and mitigate long-tail distribution effects, and (3) a
memory-based Hard Error Token (HET) optimization strategy that emphasizes
difficult tokens during training. Extensive experiments on the QaTa-COV19 and
MosMedData+ datasets demonstrate that NTP-MRISeg achieves new state-of-the-art
performance, offering a streamlined and effective alternative to traditional
MRIS pipelines.

Result: 在DrivingStereo和Waymo数据集上的广泛实验表明，PITTA在测试时自适应期间显著超越了现有最先进技术，实现了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: PITTA框架通过创新的姿态无关自适应和实例感知掩码策略，有效解决了单目深度估计在动态环境中的测试时自适应问题，展现了卓越的性能。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation (MDE), inferring pixel-level depths in single RGB
images from a monocular camera, plays a crucial and pivotal role in a variety
of AI applications demanding a three-dimensional (3D) topographical scene. In
the real-world scenarios, MDE models often need to be deployed in environments
with different conditions from those for training. Test-time (domain)
adaptation (TTA) is one of the compelling and practical approaches to address
the issue. Although there have been notable advancements in TTA for MDE,
particularly in a self-supervised manner, existing methods are still
ineffective and problematic when applied to diverse and dynamic environments.
To break through this challenge, we propose a novel and high-performing TTA
framework for MDE, named PITTA. Our approach incorporates two key innovative
strategies: (i) pose-agnostic TTA paradigm for MDE and (ii) instance-aware
image masking. Specifically, PITTA enables highly effective TTA on a pretrained
MDE network in a pose-agnostic manner without resorting to any camera pose
information. Besides, our instance-aware masking strategy extracts
instance-wise masks for dynamic objects (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians, etc.)
from a segmentation mask produced by a pretrained panoptic segmentation
network, by removing static objects including background components. To further
boost performance, we also present a simple yet effective edge extraction
methodology for the input image (i.e., a single monocular image) and depth map.
Extensive experimental evaluations on DrivingStereo and Waymo datasets with
varying environmental conditions demonstrate that our proposed framework,
PITTA, surpasses the existing state-of-the-art techniques with remarkable
performance improvements in MDE during TTA.

*Yuanxiang Huangfu,Chaochao Wang,Weilei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Role-SynthCLIP是一种新颖的数据合成框架，通过多视角角色扮演提示引导MLLMs生成语义多样的图像-文本对，提高CLIP模型的训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成数据生成方法主要关注增加数据量，但往往导致语义多样性有限和冗余/浅显的描述。需要解决语义多样性不足的问题。

Method: 使用多视角角色扮演提示（如组合分析师、图像上下文解释器）来指导多模态大语言模型从不同视角生成语义多样的描述，增强图像-文本对的语义多样性和细粒度对齐。

Result: 仅使用100万Role-SynthCLIP对训练的CLIP-B/16模型在MS COCO验证集上达到64.1%的Recall@1，比现有最佳合成数据基线（使用500万对训练）高出2.8个百分点。

Conclusion: Role-SynthCLIP框架能有效提升合成数据的语义多样性和质量，在保持图像-文本对总数不变的情况下显著提高CLIP模型的性能。

Abstract: The effectiveness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models
critically depends on the semantic diversity and quality of their training
data. However, while existing synthetic data generation methods primarily focus
on increasing data volume, such emphasis often leads to limited semantic
diversity and redundant or shallow captions. To address this limitation, we
propose Role-SynthCLIP, a novel data synthesis framework that leverages
multi-perspective role-playing prompts (e.g., a compositional analyst, an
interpreter of image context) to guide Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
in generating semantically diverse captions from distinct viewpoints. This
mechanism enhances the semantic diversity and fine-grained image-text alignment
of synthetic pairs, thereby improving caption expressiveness and accuracy while
keeping the total number of image-text pairs unchanged. Experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. A CLIP-B/16 model
trained on only 1 million Role-SynthCLIP pairs achieves a Recall@1 of 64.1% on
the MS COCO validation set, surpassing the best existing synthetic data
baseline (trained on 5M pairs) by 2.8 percentage points. The code and trained
models are released at https://github.com/huangfu170/Role-SynthCLIP.

TL;DR: 提出了SurgiATM手术烟雾去除方法，通过结合物理大气模型和数据驱动深度学习模型，在保持轻量化的同时提升现有手术去烟架构的准确性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 腹腔镜手术中组织烧灼产生的烟雾会显著降低内窥镜图像质量，增加手术风险并阻碍临床决策和计算机辅助视觉分析，因此需要有效的手术烟雾去除方法。

Method: SurgiATM统计性地桥接基于物理的大气模型和数据驱动的深度学习模型，结合前者的泛化能力和后者的高精度。它是一个轻量级的即插即用模块，只需两个超参数且不增加可训练权重。

Result: 在三个公共手术数据集上的实验表明，SurgiATM能够普遍降低现有模型的恢复误差，相对增强其泛化能力，且不增加任何可训练层或权重。

Conclusion: SurgiATM方法具有便利性、低成本、有效性和泛化性等优势，能够更好地满足临床需求。

Abstract: During laparoscopic surgery, smoke generated by tissue cauterization can
significantly degrade the visual quality of endoscopic frames, increasing the
risk of surgical errors and hindering both clinical decision-making and
computer-assisted visual analysis. Consequently, removing surgical smoke is
critical to ensuring patient safety and maintaining operative efficiency. In
this study, we propose the Surgical Atmospheric Model (SurgiATM) for surgical
smoke removal. SurgiATM statistically bridges a physics-based atmospheric model
and data-driven deep learning models, combining the superior generalizability
of the former with the high accuracy of the latter. Furthermore, SurgiATM is
designed as a lightweight, plug-and-play module that can be seamlessly
integrated into diverse surgical desmoking architectures to enhance their
accuracy and stability, better meeting clinical requirements. It introduces
only two hyperparameters and no additional trainable weights, preserving the
original network architecture with minimal computational and modification
overhead. We conduct extensive experiments on three public surgical datasets
with ten desmoking methods, involving multiple network architectures and
covering diverse procedures, including cholecystectomy, partial nephrectomy,
and diaphragm dissection. The results demonstrate that incorporating SurgiATM
commonly reduces the restoration errors of existing models and relatively
enhances their generalizability, without adding any trainable layers or
weights. This highlights the convenience, low cost, effectiveness, and
generalizability of the proposed method. The code for SurgiATM is released at
https://github.com/MingyuShengSMY/SurgiATM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解对抗样本与干净样本的内在差异是增强DNN鲁棒性和检测对抗攻击的关键。研究发现图像对抗样本对遮挡特别敏感。

Method: 使用9种典型攻击生成对抗样本，提出SMCE指标量化模型在遮挡下的置信度波动，基于此开发SWM-AED检测方法。

Result: 在1800+测试图像上，SMCE计算显示对抗样本在遮挡下的置信度波动显著高于原始样本。SWM-AED在CIFAR-10上达到62%-96.5%的检测准确率。

Conclusion: 基于遮挡敏感性的检测方法能有效识别对抗样本，避免传统对抗训练的灾难性过拟合问题。

Abstract: Understanding intrinsic differences between adversarial examples and clean
samples is key to enhancing DNN robustness and detection against adversarial
attacks. This study first empirically finds that image-based adversarial
examples are notably sensitive to occlusion. Controlled experiments on CIFAR-10
used nine canonical attacks (e.g., FGSM, PGD) to generate adversarial examples,
paired with original samples for evaluation. We introduce Sliding Mask
Confidence Entropy (SMCE) to quantify model confidence fluctuation under
occlusion. Using 1800+ test images, SMCE calculations supported by Mask Entropy
Field Maps and statistical distributions show adversarial examples have
significantly higher confidence volatility under occlusion than originals.
Based on this, we propose Sliding Window Mask-based Adversarial Example
Detection (SWM-AED), which avoids catastrophic overfitting of conventional
adversarial training. Evaluations across classifiers and attacks on CIFAR-10
demonstrate robust performance, with accuracy over 62% in most cases and up to
96.5%.

Motivation: 解决现有虚拟数据集构建复杂、域泛化能力差的问题，在保护数据隐私的同时提升Re-ID模型在真实场景中的应用效果。

Method: 第一阶段：使用多维度属性提示驱动扩散模型生成大规模虚拟数据集GenePerson；第二阶段：提出提示驱动解耦机制，通过对比学习和文本反演网络分离风格与内容特征，学习域不变内容特征。

Result: 在GenePerson数据集上训练的模型实现了最先进的泛化性能，超越了现有真实和虚拟Re-ID数据集上的表现。

Conclusion: DPPP范式有效解决了虚拟数据集的构建和泛化问题，为隐私保护的Re-ID任务提供了可行方案。

Abstract: With growing concerns over data privacy, researchers have started using
virtual data as an alternative to sensitive real-world images for training
person re-identification (Re-ID) models. However, existing virtual datasets
produced by game engines still face challenges such as complex construction and
poor domain generalization, making them difficult to apply in real scenarios.
To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-stage Prompt-driven
Privacy-preserving Paradigm (DPPP). In the first stage, we generate rich
prompts incorporating multi-dimensional attributes such as pedestrian
appearance, illumination, and viewpoint that drive the diffusion model to
synthesize diverse data end-to-end, building a large-scale virtual dataset
named GenePerson with 130,519 images of 6,641 identities. In the second stage,
we propose a Prompt-driven Disentanglement Mechanism (PDM) to learn
domain-invariant generalization features. With the aid of contrastive learning,
we employ two textual inversion networks to map images into pseudo-words
representing style and content, respectively, thereby constructing
style-disentangled content prompts to guide the model in learning
domain-invariant content features at the image level. Experiments demonstrate
that models trained on GenePerson with PDM achieve state-of-the-art
generalization performance, surpassing those on popular real and virtual Re-ID
datasets.

Motivation: 现有基于合成数据的视觉模型参数固定，难以泛化到复杂的真实世界天气退化场景，需要开发能够持续适应真实条件的方法。

Method: 首先构建HFLS-Weather物理驱动高保真数据集，然后设计双层次强化学习框架：局部层次通过扰动驱动的图像质量优化精炼天气特定恢复模型；全局层次通过元控制器根据场景退化动态编排模型选择和执行顺序。

Result: 该框架在多种恶劣天气场景下实现了最先进的性能，能够持续适应真实世界条件。

Conclusion: 提出的双层次强化学习框架有效解决了恶劣天气下视觉感知的泛化问题，为无监督天气恢复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Adverse weather severely impairs real-world visual perception, while existing
vision models trained on synthetic data with fixed parameters struggle to
generalize to complex degradations. To address this, we first construct
HFLS-Weather, a physics-driven, high-fidelity dataset that simulates diverse
weather phenomena, and then design a dual-level reinforcement learning
framework initialized with HFLS-Weather for cold-start training. Within this
framework, at the local level, weather-specific restoration models are refined
through perturbation-driven image quality optimization, enabling reward-based
learning without paired supervision; at the global level, a meta-controller
dynamically orchestrates model selection and execution order according to scene
degradation. This framework enables continuous adaptation to real-world
conditions and achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of
adverse weather scenarios. Code is available at

TL;DR: 本研究首次应用深度学习对原始OCT B扫描图像进行阿尔茨海默病早期检测，通过预训练模型和特定增强技术，在4年队列中达到AUC 0.62，为基于OCT的AD预测建立了基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统研究主要关注分割层厚度测量，本研究探索直接对OCT B扫描图像进行分类以实现AD早期检测，因为成像比临床诊断早数年，早期检测更具挑战性。

Method: 使用UK Biobank队列数据，微调评估多个预训练模型（包括ImageNet网络和OCT专用RETFound转换器），应用标准和OCT特定增强技术，采用年加权损失函数优先处理成像后4年内诊断的病例。

Result: ResNet-34在4年队列中表现最稳定，AUC为0.62；可解释性分析确认AD组与对照组在中央黄斑亚区存在局部结构差异。

Conclusion: 虽然低于临床应用阈值，但研究为OCT-based AD预测提供了基准，强调了在AD诊断前数年检测细微视网膜生物标志物的挑战，指出需要更大数据集和多模态方法。

Abstract: Alterations in retinal layer thickness, measurable using Optical Coherence
Tomography (OCT), have been associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as
Alzheimer's disease (AD). While previous studies have mainly focused on
segmented layer thickness measurements, this study explored the direct
classification of OCT B-scan images for the early detection of AD. To our
knowledge, this is the first application of deep learning to raw OCT B-scans
for AD prediction in the literature. Unlike conventional medical image
classification tasks, early detection is more challenging than diagnosis
because imaging precedes clinical diagnosis by several years. We fine-tuned and
evaluated multiple pretrained models, including ImageNet-based networks and the
OCT-specific RETFound transformer, using subject-level cross-validation
datasets matched for age, sex, and imaging instances from the UK Biobank
cohort. To reduce overfitting in this small, high-dimensional dataset, both
standard and OCT-specific augmentation techniques were applied, along with a
year-weighted loss function that prioritized cases diagnosed within four years
of imaging. ResNet-34 produced the most stable results, achieving an AUC of
0.62 in the 4-year cohort. Although below the threshold for clinical
application, our explainability analyses confirmed localized structural
differences in the central macular subfield between the AD and control groups.
These findings provide a baseline for OCT-based AD prediction, highlight the
challenges of detecting subtle retinal biomarkers years before AD diagnosis,
and point to the need for larger datasets and multimodal approaches.

Conclusion: 这项工作为冬季场景下的可靠车道检测奠定了坚实基础，并为全天候自动驾驶研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Lane detection for autonomous driving in snow-covered environments remains a
major challenge due to the frequent absence or occlusion of lane markings. In
this paper, we present a novel, robust and realtime capable approach that
bypasses the reliance on traditional lane markings by detecting roadside
features,specifically vertical roadside posts called delineators, as indirect
lane indicators. Our method first perceives these posts, then fits a smooth
lane trajectory using a parameterized Bezier curve model, leveraging spatial
consistency and road geometry. To support training and evaluation in these
challenging scenarios, we introduce SnowyLane, a new synthetic dataset
containing 80,000 annotated frames capture winter driving conditions, with
varying snow coverage, and lighting conditions. Compared to state-of-the-art
lane detection systems, our approach demonstrates significantly improved
robustness in adverse weather, particularly in cases with heavy snow occlusion.
This work establishes a strong foundation for reliable lane detection in winter
scenarios and contributes a valuable resource for future research in
all-weather autonomous driving. The dataset is available at

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将可变形高斯泼溅方法分割为前景和背景组件的方法，通过稀疏掩码监督解决稀疏相机配置下的动态3D重建问题，在保持模型小型化的同时提升了重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在电影制作中，预算限制往往导致稀疏的相机配置，这限制了现有最先进方法在捕捉复杂动态特征时的性能。为了解决这个问题，需要一种能够在稀疏相机设置下有效进行动态3D重建的方法。

Method: 将规范高斯泼溅和变形场分割为前景和背景组件，使用t=0帧的稀疏掩码集进行初始化。在规范预训练阶段，每个组件使用不同的损失函数分别训练。在动态训练阶段，为每个变形场建模不同的参数：前景学习颜色、位置和旋转的变化，背景仅学习位置变化。

Result: 在3D和2.5D娱乐数据集上的实验表明，该方法在3D场景上实现了比最先进方法高3 PSNR的性能，同时模型大小减少一半。无需密集掩码监督即可生成包括透明和动态纹理的分割动态重建结果。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏相机配置下实现了高质量的动态3D重建，通过前景背景分离策略有效处理了复杂动态场景，为电影制作等应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Deformable Gaussian Splatting (GS) accomplishes photorealistic dynamic 3-D
reconstruction from dense multi-view video (MVV) by learning to deform a
canonical GS representation. However, in filmmaking, tight budgets can result
in sparse camera configurations, which limits state-of-the-art (SotA) methods
when capturing complex dynamic features. To address this issue, we introduce an
approach that splits the canonical Gaussians and deformation field into
foreground and background components using a sparse set of masks for frames at
t=0. Each representation is separately trained on different loss functions
during canonical pre-training. Then, during dynamic training, different
parameters are modeled for each deformation field following common filmmaking
practices. The foreground stage contains diverse dynamic features so changes in
color, position and rotation are learned. While, the background containing
film-crew and equipment, is typically dimmer and less dynamic so only changes
in point position are learned. Experiments on 3-D and 2.5-D entertainment
datasets show that our method produces SotA qualitative and quantitative
results; up to 3 PSNR higher with half the model size on 3-D scenes. Unlike the
SotA and without the need for dense mask supervision, our method also produces
segmented dynamic reconstructions including transparent and dynamic textures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DINOv3模型需要高分辨率输入图像和大量计算资源，限制了其在实际应用中的使用。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏方法，让学生模型学习生成与教师模型相似的高分辨率特征图，但计算成本大幅降低。

Result: BRIXEL在固定分辨率下显著优于基线DINOv3模型，能以较低计算成本生成与教师模型相似的特征图。

Conclusion: BRIXEL提供了一种有效的方法来平衡视觉基础模型的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve strong performance on both global and
locally dense downstream tasks. Pretrained on large images, the recent DINOv3
model family is able to produce very fine-grained dense feature maps, enabling
state-of-the-art performance. However, computing these feature maps requires
the input image to be available at very high resolution, as well as large
amounts of compute due to the squared complexity of the transformer
architecture. To address these issues, we propose BRIXEL, a simple knowledge
distillation approach that has the student learn to reproduce its own feature
maps at higher resolution. Despite its simplicity, BRIXEL outperforms the
baseline DINOv3 models by large margins on downstream tasks when the resolution
is kept fixed. Moreover, it is able to produce feature maps that are very
similar to those of the teacher at a fraction of the computational cost. Code

Conclusion: MUSE方法通过创新的自监督学习机制，显著提升了细胞核检测与分类的性能，为病理图像分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Nucleus detection and classification (NDC) in histopathology analysis is a
fundamental task that underpins a wide range of high-level pathology
applications. However, existing methods heavily rely on labor-intensive
nucleus-level annotations and struggle to fully exploit large-scale unlabeled
data for learning discriminative nucleus representations. In this work, we
propose MUSE (MUlti-scale denSE self-distillation), a novel self-supervised
learning method tailored for NDC. At its core is NuLo (Nucleus-based Local
self-distillation), a coordinate-guided mechanism that enables flexible local
self-distillation based on predicted nucleus positions. By removing the need
for strict spatial alignment between augmented views, NuLo allows critical
cross-scale alignment, thus unlocking the capacity of models for fine-grained
nucleus-level representation. To support MUSE, we design a simple yet effective
encoder-decoder architecture and a large field-of-view semi-supervised
fine-tuning strategy that together maximize the value of unlabeled pathology
images. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate that
MUSE effectively addresses the core challenges of histopathological NDC. The
resulting models not only surpass state-of-the-art supervised baselines but
also outperform generic pathology foundation models.

Abstract: This paper presents Walk the Lines 2 (WtL2), a unique contour tracking
algorithm specifically adapted for detailed segmentation of infrared (IR) ships
and various objects in RGB.1 This extends the original Walk the Lines (WtL)
[12], which focused solely on detailed ship segmentation in color. These
innovative WtLs can replace the standard non-maximum suppression (NMS) by using
contour tracking to refine the object contour until a 1-pixel-wide closed shape
can be binarized, forming a segmentable area in foreground-background
scenarios. WtL2 broadens the application range of WtL beyond its original
scope, adapting to IR and expanding to diverse objects within the RGB context.
To achieve IR segmentation, we adapt its input, the object contour detector, to
IR ships. In addition, the algorithm is enhanced to process a wide range of RGB
objects, outperforming the latest generation of contour-based methods when
achieving a closed object contour, offering high peak Intersection over Union
(IoU) with impressive details. This positions WtL2 as a compelling method for
specialized applications that require detailed segmentation or high-quality
samples, potentially accelerating progress in several niche areas of image
segmentation.

Abstract: Controlling the spatial and semantic structure of diffusion-generated images
remains a challenge. Existing methods like ControlNet rely on handcrafted
condition maps and retraining, limiting flexibility and generalization.
Inversion-based approaches offer stronger alignment but incur high inference
cost due to dual-path denoising. We present FreeControl, a training-free
framework for semantic structural control in diffusion models. Unlike prior
methods that extract attention across multiple timesteps, FreeControl performs
one-step attention extraction from a single, optimally chosen key timestep and
reuses it throughout denoising. This enables efficient structural guidance
without inversion or retraining. To further improve quality and stability, we
introduce Latent-Condition Decoupling (LCD): a principled separation of the key
timestep and the noised latent used in attention extraction. LCD provides finer
control over attention quality and eliminates structural artifacts. FreeControl
also supports compositional control via reference images assembled from
multiple sources - enabling intuitive scene layout design and stronger prompt
alignment. FreeControl introduces a new paradigm for test-time control,
enabling structurally and semantically aligned, visually coherent generation
directly from raw images, with the flexibility for intuitive compositional
design and compatibility with modern diffusion models at approximately 5
percent additional cost.

*Mengqi Guo,Bo Xu,Yanyan Li,Gim Hee Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 4D3R是一个无需相机位姿的动态神经渲染框架，通过两阶段方法解耦静态和动态组件，在动态场景的新视角合成任务中实现了显著的性能提升和计算效率优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单目视频中进行动态场景新视角合成的挑战，特别是在相机位姿未知的情况下。现有方法如NeRF和3DGS在静态场景表现良好，但在动态内容和预计算相机位姿依赖方面存在局限。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）利用3D基础模型进行初始位姿和几何估计；2）运动感知细化。关键技术包括运动感知束调整模块（MA-BA）和运动感知高斯泼溅表示（MA-GS），结合变形场MLP和线性混合蒙皮来建模动态运动。

Result: 在真实世界动态数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法实现了高达1.8dB的PSNR提升，在具有大型动态物体的挑战性场景中表现尤为突出，同时计算需求比之前的动态场景表示减少了5倍。

Conclusion: 4D3R框架在动态场景新视角合成任务中取得了显著进展，通过有效的运动建模和计算优化，为未知相机位姿的动态场景渲染提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis from monocular videos of dynamic scenes with unknown
camera poses remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision and graphics.
While recent advances in 3D representations such as Neural Radiance Fields
(NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have shown promising results for static
scenes, they struggle with dynamic content and typically rely on pre-computed
camera poses. We present 4D3R, a pose-free dynamic neural rendering framework
that decouples static and dynamic components through a two-stage approach. Our
method first leverages 3D foundational models for initial pose and geometry
estimation, followed by motion-aware refinement. 4D3R introduces two key
technical innovations: (1) a motion-aware bundle adjustment (MA-BA) module that
combines transformer-based learned priors with SAM2 for robust dynamic object
segmentation, enabling more accurate camera pose refinement; and (2) an
efficient Motion-Aware Gaussian Splatting (MA-GS) representation that uses
control points with a deformation field MLP and linear blend skinning to model
dynamic motion, significantly reducing computational cost while maintaining
high-quality reconstruction. Extensive experiments on real-world dynamic
datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to 1.8dB PSNR improvement
over state-of-the-art methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with large
dynamic objects, while reducing computational requirements by 5x compared to
previous dynamic scene representations.

*Xincheng Yao,Yan Luo,Zefeng Qian,Chongyang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种专门针对工业异常检测的预训练表示学习框架，通过角度和范数导向的对比损失来最大化正常和异常特征之间的差异，并在大规模AD数据集RealIAD上进行预训练，避免了ImageNet预训练与AD任务不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前主流的异常检测方法主要基于ImageNet预训练的特征网络，但ImageNet预训练过程与异常检测目标不匹配，且自然图像与工业图像存在分布偏移，导致预训练特征对AD任务不是最优的。

Method: 提出了角度和范数导向的对比损失，同时在大型AD数据集RealIAD上进行预训练，并基于类别通用表示（残差特征）学习预训练AD表示。

Result: 在五个AD数据集和五个骨干网络上的大量实验表明，该预训练特征具有优越性，只需将原有特征替换为本文预训练表示即可提升性能。

Conclusion: 本文提出的专门针对AD任务的预训练表示学习框架有效解决了ImageNet预训练与AD任务不匹配的问题，为异常检测领域的发展提供了有力支持。

Abstract: The current mainstream and state-of-the-art anomaly detection (AD) methods
are substantially established on pretrained feature networks yielded by
ImageNet pretraining. However, regardless of supervised or self-supervised
pretraining, the pretraining process on ImageNet does not match the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., pretraining in natural images doesn't aim to
distinguish between normal and abnormal). Moreover, natural images and
industrial image data in AD scenarios typically have the distribution shift.
The two issues can cause ImageNet-pretrained features to be suboptimal for AD
tasks. To further promote the development of the AD field, pretrained
representations specially for AD tasks are eager and very valuable. To this
end, we propose a novel AD representation learning framework specially designed
for learning robust and discriminative pretrained representations for
industrial anomaly detection. Specifically, closely surrounding the goal of
anomaly detection (i.e., focus on discrepancies between normals and anomalies),
we propose angle- and norm-oriented contrastive losses to maximize the angle
size and norm difference between normal and abnormal features simultaneously.
To avoid the distribution shift from natural images to AD images, our
pretraining is performed on a large-scale AD dataset, RealIAD. To further
alleviate the potential shift between pretraining data and downstream AD
datasets, we learn the pretrained AD representations based on the
class-generalizable representation, residual features. For evaluation, based on
five embedding-based AD methods, we simply replace their original features with
our pretrained representations. Extensive experiments on five AD datasets and
five backbones consistently show the superiority of our pretrained features.

*Mohamed Sanim Akremi,Rim Slama,Hedi Tabia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于骨架序列流的在线识别系统，使用SPD矩阵表示和孪生网络实现动作检测和分类


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的骨架动作识别方法多为分段识别，不适合在线实时场景，需要开发能够处理连续流数据的在线识别系统

Method: 系统由检测器和分类器组成：检测器使用SPD矩阵表示骨架数据，孪生网络学习语义相似性来预测动作时间区间；分类器识别每个区间内的动作

Result: 在手势和身体动作识别基准测试中，系统在大多数情况下优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: 提出的在线识别系统能够有效处理连续骨架序列流，在实时场景中表现出色

Abstract: Online continuous motion recognition is a hot topic of research since it is
more practical in real life application cases. Recently, Skeleton-based
approaches have become increasingly popular, demonstrating the power of using
such 3D temporal data. However, most of these works have focused on
segment-based recognition and are not suitable for the online scenarios. In
this paper, we propose an online recognition system for skeleton sequence
streaming composed from two main components: a detector and a classifier, which
use a Semi-Positive Definite (SPD) matrix representation and a Siamese network.
The powerful statistical representations for the skeletal data given by the SPD
matrices and the learning of their semantic similarity by the Siamese network
enable the detector to predict time intervals of the motions throughout an
unsegmented sequence. In addition, they ensure the classifier capability to
recognize the motion in each predicted interval. The proposed detector is
flexible and able to identify the kinetic state continuously. We conduct
extensive experiments on both hand gesture and body action recognition
benchmarks to prove the accuracy of our online recognition system which in most
cases outperforms state-of-the-art performances.

TL;DR: 基于裁剪3D U-Net的结直肠癌肝转移自动分割方法，在术中超声中实现接近实时的高精度分割，显著提升手术导航效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 术中超声对结直肠癌肝转移病灶的精确勾画对实现阴性切缘至关重要，但由于低对比度、噪声和操作者依赖性等问题，传统方法面临挑战。自动分割可提高超声导航工作流程的精度和效率。

Method: 使用85例患者的追踪3D术中超声数据，通过nnU-Net框架实现3D U-Net分割。比较两种变体：全超声体积训练和肿瘤周围裁剪区域训练。评估指标包括Dice相似系数、Hausdorff距离和相对体积差异。

Result: 裁剪体积模型在所有指标上显著优于全体积模型（AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718），中位DSC=0.74，召回率=0.79，HDist=17.1mm，性能与半自动分割相当但速度快4倍（约1分钟）。前瞻性测试证实了稳健的实时性能。

Conclusion: 裁剪3D U-Net方法为肝转移手术提供了可靠、接近实时的自动分割，无需配准即可实现高效的超声导航，接近专家水平精度，同时大幅减少人工操作时间和工作量。

Abstract: Introduction: Accurate intraoperative delineation of colorectal liver
metastases (CRLM) is crucial for achieving negative resection margins but
remains challenging using intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) due to low contrast,
noise, and operator dependency. Automated segmentation could enhance precision
and efficiency in ultrasound-based navigation workflows.
  Methods: Eighty-five tracked 3D iUS volumes from 85 CRLM patients were used
to train and evaluate a 3D U-Net implemented via the nnU-Net framework. Two
variants were compared: one trained on full iUS volumes and another on cropped
regions around tumors. Segmentation accuracy was assessed using Dice Similarity
Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HDist.), and Relative Volume Difference
(RVD) on retrospective and prospective datasets. The workflow was integrated
into 3D Slicer for real-time intraoperative use.
  Results: The cropped-volume model significantly outperformed the full-volume
model across all metrics (AUC-ROC = 0.898 vs 0.718). It achieved median DSC =
0.74, recall = 0.79, and HDist. = 17.1 mm comparable to semi-automatic
segmentation but with ~4x faster execution (~ 1 min). Prospective
intraoperative testing confirmed robust and consistent performance, with
clinically acceptable accuracy for real-time surgical guidance.
  Conclusion: Automatic 3D segmentation of CRLM in iUS using a cropped 3D U-Net
provides reliable, near real-time results with minimal operator input. The
method enables efficient, registration-free ultrasound-based navigation for
hepatic surgery, approaching expert-level accuracy while substantially reducing
manual workload and procedure time.

Abstract: The analysis of character appearance frequency is essential for understanding
narrative structure, character prominence, and story progression in anime. In
this work, we introduce OregairuChar, a benchmark dataset designed for
appearance frequency analysis in the anime series My Teen Romantic Comedy
SNAFU. The dataset comprises 1600 manually selected frames from the third
season, annotated with 2860 bounding boxes across 11 main characters.
OregairuChar captures diverse visual challenges, including occlusion, pose
variation, and inter-character similarity, providing a realistic basis for
appearance-based studies. To enable quantitative research, we benchmark several
object detection models on the dataset and leverage their predictions for
fine-grained, episode-level analysis of character presence over time. This
approach reveals patterns of character prominence and their evolution within
the narrative. By emphasizing appearance frequency, OregairuChar serves as a
valuable resource for exploring computational narrative dynamics and
character-centric storytelling in stylized media.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeepEyesV2提出了一个两阶段训练框架来构建智能多模态代理模型，通过冷启动和强化学习相结合的方法实现稳健的工具调用行为，并在RealX-Bench基准测试中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态模型虽然能理解文本和图像，但缺乏主动调用外部工具（如代码执行环境、网络搜索）并将其整合到推理过程中的能力。直接使用强化学习单独训练无法诱导出稳健的工具使用行为。

Method: 采用两阶段训练流程：1）冷启动阶段建立工具使用模式；2）强化学习阶段进一步优化工具调用。构建了多样化、适度挑战的训练数据集，特别包含工具使用有益的示例。还引入了RealX-Bench基准来评估真实世界的多模态推理能力。

Result: DeepEyesV2在RealX-Bench和其他代表性基准测试中表现出色，在真实世界理解、数学推理和搜索密集型任务上都有效。模型展现出任务自适应的工具调用能力，倾向于对感知任务使用图像操作，对推理任务使用数值计算。强化学习还能实现复杂的工具组合和基于上下文的选择性工具调用。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练方法能有效构建智能多模态代理模型，DeepEyesV2的成功为社区开发此类模型提供了指导。强化学习在诱导复杂工具使用行为方面发挥关键作用。

Abstract: Agentic multimodal models should not only comprehend text and images, but
also actively invoke external tools, such as code execution environments and
web search, and integrate these operations into reasoning. In this work, we
introduce DeepEyesV2 and explore how to build an agentic multimodal model from
the perspectives of data construction, training methods, and model evaluation.
We observe that direct reinforcement learning alone fails to induce robust
tool-use behavior. This phenomenon motivates a two-stage training pipeline: a
cold-start stage to establish tool-use patterns, and reinforcement learning
stage to further refine tool invocation. We curate a diverse, moderately
challenging training dataset, specifically including examples where tool use is
beneficial. We further introduce RealX-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark
designed to evaluate real-world multimodal reasoning, which inherently requires
the integration of multiple capabilities, including perception, search, and
reasoning. We evaluate DeepEyesV2 on RealX-Bench and other representative
benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness across real-world understanding,
mathematical reasoning, and search-intensive tasks. Moreover, DeepEyesV2
exhibits task-adaptive tool invocation, tending to use image operations for
perception tasks and numerical computations for reasoning tasks. Reinforcement
learning further enables complex tool combinations and allows model to
selectively invoke tools based on context. We hope our study can provide
guidance for community in developing agentic multimodal models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自报告方法存在回忆偏差，摄像头方法有隐私问题，现有可穿戴设备方法主要针对有限食物类型（如汉堡、披萨），无法处理中餐的多样性。

Method: 设计两阶段检测流程：第一阶段通过区分特征性时间模式识别进食状态；第二阶段基于进食期间捕获的动作进行细粒度食物类型识别。使用智能手表采集手部动作，智能眼镜采集头部动态。

Result: 构建了包含27.5小时IMU记录的数据集，涵盖11个食物类别和10名参与者。实验表明CuisineSense在进食状态检测和食物分类方面均达到高准确率。

Conclusion: CuisineSense为无干扰、基于可穿戴设备的饮食监测提供了实用解决方案，系统代码已公开。

Abstract: Accurate food intake detection is vital for dietary monitoring and chronic
disease prevention. Traditional self-report methods are prone to recall bias,
while camera-based approaches raise concerns about privacy. Furthermore,
existing wearable-based methods primarily focus on a limited number of food
types, such as hamburgers and pizza, failing to address the vast diversity of
Chinese cuisine. To bridge this gap, we propose CuisineSense, a system that
classifies Chinese food types by integrating hand motion cues from a smartwatch
with head dynamics from smart glasses. To filter out irrelevant daily
activities, we design a two-stage detection pipeline. The first stage
identifies eating states by distinguishing characteristic temporal patterns
from non-eating behaviors. The second stage then conducts fine-grained food
type recognition based on the motions captured during food intake. To evaluate
CuisineSense, we construct a dataset comprising 27.5 hours of IMU recordings
across 11 food categories and 10 participants. Experiments demonstrate that
CuisineSense achieves high accuracy in both eating state detection and food
classification, offering a practical solution for unobtrusive, wearable-based
dietary monitoring.The system code is publicly available at

Abstract: Despite significant progress in Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) for
offline video understanding, existing online Video-LLMs typically struggle to
simultaneously process continuous frame-by-frame inputs and determine optimal
response timing, often compromising real-time responsiveness and narrative
coherence. To address these limitations, we introduce LiveStar, a pioneering
live streaming assistant that achieves always-on proactive responses through
adaptive streaming decoding. Specifically, LiveStar incorporates: (1) a
training strategy enabling incremental video-language alignment for
variable-length video streams, preserving temporal consistency across
dynamically evolving frame sequences; (2) a response-silence decoding framework
that determines optimal proactive response timing via a single forward pass
verification; (3) memory-aware acceleration via peak-end memory compression for
online inference on 10+ minute videos, combined with streaming key-value cache
to achieve 1.53x faster inference. We also construct an OmniStar dataset, a
comprehensive dataset for training and benchmarking that encompasses 15 diverse
real-world scenarios and 5 evaluation tasks for online video understanding.
Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate LiveStar's
state-of-the-art performance, achieving an average 19.5% improvement in
semantic correctness with 18.1% reduced timing difference compared to existing
online Video-LLMs, while improving FPS by 12.0% across all five OmniStar tasks.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了现有点云生成评估指标的不足，提出了更稳健的评估方法（DCD和SNC），并开发了Diffusion Point Transformer模型，在ShapeNet数据集上实现了最先进的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着3D点云技术的重要性日益增长，现有生成模型评估指标（特别是基于Chamfer Distance的指标）存在对缺陷不鲁棒、无法准确捕捉几何保真度和局部形状一致性的问题，需要开发更可靠的评估方法和更高质量的生成模型。

Method: 1）引入样本对齐预处理和Density-Aware Chamfer Distance（DCD）来提高评估指标的稳健性；2）提出Surface Normal Concordance（SNC）指标，通过比较估计点法向量来近似表面相似性；3）基于transformer的点云分析模型，开发Diffusion Point Transformer架构用于生成高质量3D结构。

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上的广泛实验表明，提出的评估方法组合（DCD+SNC）能更全面地评估生成样本质量，Diffusion Point Transformer模型在生成点云质量方面优于先前解决方案，达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 通过改进评估指标和开发新的生成架构，该工作为3D点云生成提供了更可靠的评估框架和更高质量的生成能力，推动了点云生成技术的发展。

Abstract: As 3D point clouds become a cornerstone of modern technology, the need for
sophisticated generative models and reliable evaluation metrics has grown
exponentially. In this work, we first expose that some commonly used metrics
for evaluating generated point clouds, particularly those based on Chamfer
Distance (CD), lack robustness against defects and fail to capture geometric
fidelity and local shape consistency when used as quality indicators. We
further show that introducing samples alignment prior to distance calculation
and replacing CD with Density-Aware Chamfer Distance (DCD) are simple yet
essential steps to ensure the consistency and robustness of point cloud
generative model evaluation metrics. While existing metrics primarily focus on
directly comparing 3D Euclidean coordinates, we present a novel metric, named
Surface Normal Concordance (SNC), which approximates surface similarity by
comparing estimated point normals. This new metric, when combined with
traditional ones, provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the quality of
generated samples. Finally, leveraging recent advancements in transformer-based
models for point cloud analysis, such as serialized patch attention , we
propose a new architecture for generating high-fidelity 3D structures, the
Diffusion Point Transformer. We perform extensive experiments and comparisons
on the ShapeNet dataset, showing that our model outperforms previous solutions,
particularly in terms of quality of generated point clouds, achieving new
state-of-the-art. Code available at

Conclusion: 提出的句子到图像隐写方法成功实现了语义丰富的句子级信息隐藏，为大语言模型在隐写领域的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Although steganography has made significant advancements in recent years, it
still struggles to embed semantically rich, sentence-level information into
carriers. However, in the era of AIGC, the capacity of steganography is more
critical than ever. In this work, we present Sentence-to-Image Steganography,
an instance of Semantic Steganography, a novel task that enables the hiding of
arbitrary sentence-level messages within a cover image. Furthermore, we
establish a benchmark named Invisible Text (IVT), comprising a diverse set of
sentence-level texts as secret messages for evaluation. Finally, we present
$\mathbf{S^2LM}$: Semantic Steganographic Language Model, which utilizes large
language models (LLMs) to embed high-level textual information, such as
sentences or even paragraphs, into images. Unlike traditional bit-level
counterparts, $\mathrm{S^2LM}$ enables the integration of semantically rich
content through a newly designed pipeline in which the LLM is involved
throughout the entire process. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments
demonstrate that our method effectively unlocks new semantic steganographic
capabilities for LLMs. The source code will be released soon.

Conclusion: 时间建模和规范对齐在动态物体理解中具有显著效果，为4D铰接物体感知的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Articulated object perception presents significant challenges in computer
vision, particularly because most existing methods ignore temporal dynamics
despite the inherently dynamic nature of such objects. The use of 4D temporal
data has not been thoroughly explored in articulated object perception and
remains unexamined for panoptic segmentation. The lack of a benchmark dataset
further hurt this field. To this end, we introduce Artic4D as a new dataset
derived from PartNet Mobility and augmented with synthetic sensor data,
featuring 4D panoptic annotations and articulation parameters. Building on this
dataset, we propose CanonSeg4D, a novel 4D panoptic segmentation framework.
This approach explicitly estimates per-frame offsets mapping observed object
parts to a learned canonical space, thereby enhancing part-level segmentation.
The framework employs this canonical representation to achieve consistent
alignment of object parts across sequential frames. Comprehensive experiments
on Artic4D demonstrate that the proposed CanonSeg4D outperforms state of the
art approaches in panoptic segmentation accuracy in more complex scenarios.
These findings highlight the effectiveness of temporal modeling and canonical
alignment in dynamic object understanding, and pave the way for future advances
in 4D articulated object perception.

annotations and predominantly consist of short sequences featuring few actions.
To overcome these limitations, we present the Complex Motion Dataset (CompMo),
the first large-scale dataset featuring richly annotated, complex motion
sequences with precise temporal boundaries. Built through a carefully designed
data generation pipeline, CompMo includes 60,000 motion sequences, each
composed of multiple actions ranging from at least two to ten, accurately
annotated with their temporal extents. We further present DEMO, a model that
integrates a large language model with a simple motion adapter, trained to
generate dense, temporally grounded captions. Our experiments show that DEMO
substantially outperforms existing methods on CompMo as well as on adapted
benchmarks, establishing a robust baseline for future research in 3D motion
understanding and captioning.

### [54] [PreResQ-R1: Towards Fine-Grained Rank-and-Score Reinforcement Learning for Visual Quality Assessment via Preference-Response Disentangled Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05393)
*Zehui Feng,Tian Qiu,Tong Wu,Junxuan Li,Huayuan Xu,Ting Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PreResQ-R1是一个基于偏好-响应解耦强化学习的视觉质量评估框架，通过结合绝对分数回归和相对排序一致性，在少量数据上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉质量评估中主要依赖监督微调或仅排序目标，导致推理浅层、分数校准差和跨域泛化能力有限。

Method: 提出偏好-响应解耦强化学习框架，采用双分支奖励公式分别建模样本内响应一致性和样本间偏好对齐，通过组相对策略优化进行优化，并设计了全局-时序和局部-空间数据流策略用于视频质量评估。

Result: 仅在6K图像和28K视频上进行强化学习微调，就在10个IQA和5个VQA基准测试中取得SOTA结果，IQA任务的SRCC和PLCC指标分别提升5.30%和2.15%。

Conclusion: PreResQ-R1不仅实现了定量性能提升，还产生了与人类对齐的推理轨迹，揭示了质量判断背后的感知线索。

Abstract: Visual Quality Assessment (QA) seeks to predict human perceptual judgments of
visual fidelity. While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show
promise in reasoning about image and video quality, existing approaches mainly
rely on supervised fine-tuning or rank-only objectives, resulting in shallow
reasoning, poor score calibration, and limited cross-domain generalization. We
propose PreResQ-R1, a Preference-Response Disentangled Reinforcement Learning
framework that unifies absolute score regression and relative ranking
consistency within a single reasoning-driven optimization scheme. Unlike prior
QA methods, PreResQ-R1 introduces a dual-branch reward formulation that
separately models intra-sample response coherence and inter-sample preference
alignment, optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This design
encourages fine-grained, stable, and interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning
about perceptual quality. To extend beyond static imagery, we further design a
global-temporal and local-spatial data flow strategy for Video Quality
Assessment. Remarkably, with reinforcement fine-tuning on only 6K images and
28K videos, PreResQ-R1 achieves state-of-the-art results across 10 IQA and 5
VQA benchmarks under both SRCC and PLCC metrics, surpassing by margins of 5.30%
and textbf2.15% in IQA task, respectively. Beyond quantitative gains, it
produces human-aligned reasoning traces that reveal the perceptual cues
underlying quality judgments. Code and model are available.

Abstract: We present an AI-assisted Augmented Reality assembly workflow that uses deep
learning-based object recognition to identify different assembly components and
display step-by-step instructions. For each assembly step, the system displays
a bounding box around the corresponding components in the physical space, and
where the component should be placed. By connecting assembly instructions with
the real-time location of relevant components, the system eliminates the need
for manual searching, sorting, or labeling of different components before each
assembly. To demonstrate the feasibility of using object recognition for
AR-assisted assembly, we highlight a case study involving the assembly of LEGO
sculptures.

Motivation: 现有手部建模研究面临三大挑战：复杂的手部几何、外观和关节结构；非约束光照和有限视角下的建模困难；缺乏同时提供准确3D几何、高分辨率多视角图像和多样化受试者群体的数据集。

Method: 构建PALM大规模数据集，包含13k手部扫描和90k多视角图像，覆盖263名受试者。提出PALM-Net基线模型，采用基于物理的逆渲染方法学习多受试者的手部几何和材质属性先验。

Conclusion: PALM数据集的规模和多样性使其成为手部建模及相关研究的宝贵资源，为高质量个性化手部化身创建提供了新的基准和可能性。

Abstract: The ability to grasp objects, signal with gestures, and share emotion through
touch all stem from the unique capabilities of human hands. Yet creating
high-quality personalized hand avatars from images remains challenging due to
complex geometry, appearance, and articulation, particularly under
unconstrained lighting and limited views. Progress has also been limited by the
lack of datasets that jointly provide accurate 3D geometry, high-resolution
multiview imagery, and a diverse population of subjects. To address this, we
present PALM, a large-scale dataset comprising 13k high-quality hand scans from
263 subjects and 90k multi-view images, capturing rich variation in skin tone,
age, and geometry. To show its utility, we present a baseline PALM-Net, a
multi-subject prior over hand geometry and material properties learned via
physically based inverse rendering, enabling realistic, relightable
single-image hand avatar personalization. PALM's scale and diversity make it a
valuable real-world resource for hand modeling and related research.

TL;DR: MPRF是一个多模态闭环检测管道，结合视觉和LiDAR模态，在非结构化环境中实现鲁棒的闭环检测和6-DoF位姿估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在GNSS拒止环境（如行星探索）中，视觉地点识别因混叠和弱纹理而失效，LiDAR方法则受稀疏性和模糊性影响，需要更鲁棒的闭环检测方案。

Method: 采用两阶段视觉检索策略：使用DINOv2特征和SALAD聚合进行候选筛选，结合SONATA LiDAR描述子进行几何验证，集成显式6-DoF位姿估计。

Result: 在S3LI数据集上的实验表明，MPRF在精度上优于最先进的检索方法，在低纹理区域增强了位姿估计的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MPRF在准确性、效率和可靠性之间实现了良好平衡，展示了基础模型在统一地点识别和位姿估计方面的潜力。

Abstract: Robust loop closure detection is a critical component of Simultaneous
Localization and Mapping (SLAM) algorithms in GNSS-denied environments, such as
in the context of planetary exploration. In these settings, visual place
recognition often fails due to aliasing and weak textures, while LiDAR-based
methods suffer from sparsity and ambiguity. This paper presents MPRF, a
multimodal pipeline that leverages transformer-based foundation models for both
vision and LiDAR modalities to achieve robust loop closure in severely
unstructured environments. Unlike prior work limited to retrieval, MPRF
integrates a two-stage visual retrieval strategy with explicit 6-DoF pose
estimation, combining DINOv2 features with SALAD aggregation for efficient
candidate screening and SONATA-based LiDAR descriptors for geometric
verification. Experiments on the S3LI dataset and S3LI Vulcano dataset show
that MPRF outperforms state-of-the-art retrieval methods in precision while
enhancing pose estimation robustness in low-texture regions. By providing
interpretable correspondences suitable for SLAM back-ends, MPRF achieves a
favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and reliability,
demonstrating the potential of foundation models to unify place recognition and
pose estimation. Code and models will be released at github.com/DLR-RM/MPRF.

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单的卷积层修改方法，用于持续学习中的图像修复任务，无需修改主干架构即可适应新任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续学习方法在图像修复领域存在挑战，需要大量工程化的架构修改，计算开销大。正则化方法不适用于修复任务，因为不同修复问题需要不同的特征处理

Method: 通过修改卷积层来适应先前修复任务的知识，而不触及主干架构。该方法可以无缝应用于任何深度架构，无需结构修改

Result: 实验验证表明，可以引入新的修复任务而不影响现有任务的性能。新任务的性能通过适应先前任务创建的知识库得到提升

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不显著增加计算开销或推理时间的情况下增加可训练参数数量，为图像修复领域的持续学习提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Continual learning is an emerging topic in the field of deep learning, where
a model is expected to learn continuously for new upcoming tasks without
forgetting previous experiences. This field has witnessed numerous
advancements, but few works have been attempted in the direction of image
restoration. Handling large image sizes and the divergent nature of various
degradation poses a unique challenge in the restoration domain. However,
existing works require heavily engineered architectural modifications for new
task adaptation, resulting in significant computational overhead.
Regularization-based methods are unsuitable for restoration, as different
restoration challenges require different kinds of feature processing. In this
direction, we propose a simple modification of the convolution layer to adapt
the knowledge from previous restoration tasks without touching the main
backbone architecture. Therefore, it can be seamlessly applied to any deep
architecture without any structural modifications. Unlike other approaches, we
demonstrate that our model can increase the number of trainable parameters
without significantly increasing computational overhead or inference time.
Experimental validation demonstrates that new restoration tasks can be
introduced without compromising the performance of existing tasks. We also show
that performance on new restoration tasks improves by adapting the knowledge
from the knowledge base created by previous restoration tasks. The code is
available at https://github.com/aupendu/continual-restore.

Method: 使用Text-to-Vec模块生成Wav2Vec2嵌入，采用两阶段训练（预训练Wav2Vec2嵌入+微调TTS输出）联合调节语音和面部生成

Result: 实验表明基于TTS预测潜在特征的调节优于级联管道，显著提升唇形同步和视觉真实感

Conclusion: 该框架能够保持说话人身份，生成自然表达语音和同步面部运动，为文本到说话人脸合成提供有效解决方案

Abstract: We propose a text-to-talking-face synthesis framework leveraging latent
speech representations from HierSpeech++. A Text-to-Vec module generates
Wav2Vec2 embeddings from text, which jointly condition speech and face
generation. To handle distribution shifts between clean and TTS-predicted
features, we adopt a two-stage training: pretraining on Wav2Vec2 embeddings and
finetuning on TTS outputs. This enables tight audio-visual alignment, preserves
speaker identity, and produces natural, expressive speech and synchronized
facial motion without ground-truth audio at inference. Experiments show that
conditioning on TTS-predicted latent features outperforms cascaded pipelines,
improving both lip-sync and visual realism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D点云变换器依赖密集令牌表示，导致训练和推理时计算和内存成本高昂，研究发现令牌存在显著冗余性。

Method: 提出全局信息图令牌合并方法(gitmerge3D)，通过智能合并冗余令牌来大幅减少令牌数量。

Result: 在多个3D视觉任务上验证，令牌数量减少90-95%的同时保持竞争性性能，显著提升计算效率。

Conclusion: 这是首个评估大规模3D变换器模型冗余性的工作，为开发更高效的3D基础架构提供了重要见解，表明当前模型存在过度令牌化和可扩展性优化不足的问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D point cloud transformers have led to state-of-the-art
results in tasks such as semantic segmentation and reconstruction. However,
these models typically rely on dense token representations, incurring high
computational and memory costs during training and inference. In this work, we
present the finding that tokens are remarkably redundant, leading to
substantial inefficiency. We introduce gitmerge3D, a globally informed graph
token merging method that can reduce the token count by up to 90-95% while
maintaining competitive performance. This finding challenges the prevailing
assumption that more tokens inherently yield better performance and highlights
that many current models are over-tokenized and under-optimized for
scalability. We validate our method across multiple 3D vision tasks and show
consistent improvements in computational efficiency. This work is the first to
assess redundancy in large-scale 3D transformer models, providing insights into
the development of more efficient 3D foundation architectures. Our code and
checkpoints are publicly available at https://gitmerge3d.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害需要快速损坏评估来指导人道主义响应，但超高分辨率图像可用性有限，因此研究中分辨率地球观测图像的潜力。

Method: 创建了xBD-S12数据集，包含10,315对Sentinel-1和Sentinel-2的灾前灾后图像对，并进行了一系列实验验证中分辨率图像的损坏检测能力。

Result: 研究表明在10米分辨率下仍能较好地检测和映射建筑物损坏，但复杂模型架构在泛化到未见灾害时表现不佳，地理空间基础模型带来的实际效益有限。

Conclusion: Copernicus图像是快速、大范围损坏评估的可行数据源，可与超高分辨率图像互补使用，为灾害响应提供支持。

Abstract: Natural disasters demand rapid damage assessment to guide humanitarian
response. Here, we investigate whether medium-resolution Earth observation
images from the Copernicus program can support building damage assessment,
complementing very-high resolution imagery with often limited availability. We
introduce xBD-S12, a dataset of 10,315 pre- and post-disaster image pairs from
both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, spatially and temporally aligned with the
established xBD benchmark. In a series of experiments, we demonstrate that
building damage can be detected and mapped rather well in many disaster
scenarios, despite the moderate 10$\,$m ground sampling distance. We also find
that, for damage mapping at that resolution, architectural sophistication does
not seem to bring much advantage: more complex model architectures tend to
struggle with generalization to unseen disasters, and geospatial foundation
models bring little practical benefit. Our results suggest that Copernicus
images are a viable data source for rapid, wide-area damage assessment and
could play an important role alongside VHR imagery. We release the xBD-S12
dataset, code, and trained models to support further research.

Motivation: 传统照片年代估计方法主要依赖场景信息，而人脸信息作为重要的时间线索未被充分利用。多个人脸信息的聚合可能提供更准确的时间推断。

Method: 构建了CSFD-1.6M数据集（160万标注人脸），提出概率框架结合人脸识别、年龄估计模型和职业时间先验，支持多人脸信息聚合分析。

Result: 多人脸证据聚合能显著提升性能，特别是在包含多个可识别个体的图像中，该方法明显优于基于场景的基线方法。

Conclusion: 人脸信息是照片年代估计的有效线索，多人脸信息聚合能提供更可靠的时间推断，为照片年代分析开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for Photo Dating which estimates the year a
photograph was taken by leveraging information from the faces of people present
in the image. To facilitate this research, we publicly release CSFD-1.6M, a new
dataset containing over 1.6 million annotated faces, primarily from movie
stills, with identity and birth year annotations. Uniquely, our dataset
provides annotations for multiple individuals within a single image, enabling
the study of multi-face information aggregation. We propose a probabilistic
framework that formally combines visual evidence from modern face recognition
and age estimation models, and career-based temporal priors to infer the photo
capture year. Our experiments demonstrate that aggregating evidence from
multiple faces consistently improves the performance and the approach
significantly outperforms strong, scene-based baselines, particularly for
images containing several identifiable individuals.

Motivation: 流沸腾是高效的热传递机制，但流型突变会破坏热性能，需要准确低延迟的实时监测。传统光学成像方法计算量大、时间分辨率不足。

Method: 开发了五种分类模型，比较传统图像数据和事件数据。神经形态传感器检测单个像素亮度变化，无需全帧重建，提供事件信息。

Conclusion: 异步处理管道支持连续低延迟预测，通过多数投票机制提供稳定输出，实现可靠的实时反馈控制。

Abstract: Flow boiling is an efficient heat transfer mechanism capable of dissipating
high heat loads with minimal temperature variation, making it an ideal thermal
management method. However, sudden shifts between flow regimes can disrupt
thermal performance and system reliability, highlighting the need for accurate
and low-latency real-time monitoring. Conventional optical imaging methods are
limited by high computational demands and insufficient temporal resolution,
making them inadequate for capturing transient flow behavior. To address this,
we propose a real-time framework based on signals from neuromorphic sensors for
flow regime classification. Neuromorphic sensors detect changes in brightness
at individual pixels, which typically correspond to motion at edges, enabling
fast and efficient detection without full-frame reconstruction, providing
event-based information. We develop five classification models using both
traditional image data and event-based data, demonstrating that models
leveraging event data outperform frame-based approaches due to their
sensitivity to dynamic flow features. Among these models, the event-based long
short-term memory model provides the best balance between accuracy and speed,
achieving 97.6% classification accuracy with a processing time of 0.28 ms. Our
asynchronous processing pipeline supports continuous, low-latency predictions
and delivers stable output through a majority voting mechanisms, enabling
reliable real-time feedback for experimental control and intelligent thermal
management.

Abstract: This paper introduces a cutting-edge approach to cross-modal interaction for
tiny object detection by combining semantic-guided natural language processing
with advanced visual recognition backbones. The proposed method integrates the
BERT language model with the CNN-based Parallel Residual Bi-Fusion Feature
Pyramid Network (PRB-FPN-Net), incorporating innovative backbone architectures
such as ELAN, MSP, and CSP to optimize feature extraction and fusion. By
employing lemmatization and fine-tuning techniques, the system aligns semantic
cues from textual inputs with visual features, enhancing detection precision
for small and complex objects. Experimental validation using the COCO and
Objects365 datasets demonstrates that the model achieves superior performance.
On the COCO2017 validation set, it attains a 52.6% average precision (AP),
outperforming YOLO-World significantly while maintaining half the parameter
consumption of Transformer-based models like GLIP. Several test on different of
backbones such ELAN, MSP, and CSP further enable efficient handling of

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GroupKAN是一种轻量级医学图像分割网络，通过分组KAN变换和分组KAN激活模块，在保持高精度的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，超越了U-KAN和其他传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中模型需要同时具备高精度、轻量化和可解释性的需求。传统卷积架构缺乏自适应非线性，Transformer架构存在二次复杂度和不透明注意力机制的问题，而U-KAN虽然改进但仍受O(C^2)复杂度限制。

Method: 提出了两个新颖的结构化功能模块：(1)分组KAN变换：将通道划分为G组进行多元样条映射，将复杂度从O(C^2)降低到O(C^2/G)；(2)分组KAN激活：在每个通道组内应用共享的样条基映射，实现高效的token-wise非线性。

Result: 在三个医学基准数据集（BUSI、GlaS和CVC）上评估，GroupKAN实现了79.80%的平均IoU，比U-KAN提升+1.11%，同时参数数量仅为U-KAN的47.6%（3.02M vs 6.35M），并显示出更好的可解释性。

Conclusion: GroupKAN成功解决了医学图像分割中的精度、效率和可解释性平衡问题，通过分组策略有效降低了计算复杂度，为轻量级分割网络提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation requires models that are accurate, lightweight,
and interpretable. Convolutional architectures lack adaptive nonlinearity and
transparent decision-making, whereas Transformer architectures are hindered by
quadratic complexity and opaque attention mechanisms. U-KAN addresses these
challenges using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, achieving higher accuracy than
both convolutional and attention-based methods, fewer parameters than
Transformer variants, and improved interpretability compared to conventional
approaches. However, its O(C^2) complexity due to full-channel transformations
limits its scalability as the number of channels increases. To overcome this,
we introduce GroupKAN, a lightweight segmentation network that incorporates two
novel, structured functional modules: (1) Grouped KAN Transform, which
partitions channels into G groups for multivariate spline mappings, reducing
complexity to O(C^2/G), and (2) Grouped KAN Activation, which applies shared
spline-based mappings within each channel group for efficient, token-wise
nonlinearity. Evaluated on three medical benchmarks (BUSI, GlaS, and CVC),
GroupKAN achieves an average IoU of 79.80 percent, surpassing U-KAN by +1.11
percent while requiring only 47.6 percent of the parameters (3.02M vs 6.35M),
and shows improved interpretability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时序搜索方法依赖手工设计的搜索过程，缺乏端到端优化来学习最优搜索策略，导致视频内容探索不足和逻辑推理不一致。

Method: 提出TimeSearch-R框架，将时序搜索重构为交错文本-视频思考，使用强化学习（特别是GRPO-CSV方法）优化搜索策略，并构建专门数据集支持SFT冷启动和RL训练。

Result: 在Haystack-LVBench、Haystack-Ego4D等时序搜索基准和VideoMME、MLVU等长视频理解基准上取得显著提升，在LongVideoBench上相比Qwen2.5-VL提升4.1%，相比Video-R1提升2.0%。

Conclusion: TimeSearch-R通过强化学习驱动的交错思考机制，有效提升了时序搜索的完整性和长视频理解能力，建立了新的state-of-the-art性能。

Abstract: Temporal search aims to identify a minimal set of relevant frames from tens
of thousands based on a given query, serving as a foundation for accurate
long-form video understanding. Existing works attempt to progressively narrow
the search space. However, these approaches typically rely on a hand-crafted
search process, lacking end-to-end optimization for learning optimal search
strategies. In this paper, we propose TimeSearch-R, which reformulates temporal
search as interleaved text-video thinking, seamlessly integrating searching
video clips into the reasoning process through reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying RL training methods, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), to video reasoning can result in unsupervised intermediate
search decisions. This leads to insufficient exploration of the video content
and inconsistent logical reasoning. To address these issues, we introduce GRPO
with Completeness Self-Verification (GRPO-CSV), which gathers searched video
frames from the interleaved reasoning process and utilizes the same policy
model to verify the adequacy of searched frames, thereby improving the
completeness of video reasoning. Additionally, we construct datasets
specifically designed for the SFT cold-start and RL training of GRPO-CSV,
filtering out samples with weak temporal dependencies to enhance task
difficulty and improve temporal search capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that TimeSearch-R achieves significant improvements on temporal
search benchmarks such as Haystack-LVBench and Haystack-Ego4D, as well as
long-form video understanding benchmarks like VideoMME and MLVU. Notably,
TimeSearch-R establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideoBench with 4.1%
improvement over the base model Qwen2.5-VL and 2.0% over the advanced video
reasoning model Video-R1. Our code is available at

Motivation: 增强视觉语言模型的空间感知能力是类人通用智能的关键，但现有方法通常需要额外编码器，会带来额外开销并损害通用能力

Method: 构建VST-P数据集（410万样本，19种技能）和VST-R数据集（13.5万样本），采用监督微调+强化学习的渐进训练流程

Result: 在多个空间基准测试中达到SOTA，MMSI-Bench上34.8%，VSIBench上61.2%

Conclusion: VST框架能显著增强视觉语言动作模型的空间能力，为更物理接地的人工智能铺平道路

Abstract: Capturing spatial relationships from visual inputs is a cornerstone of
human-like general intelligence. Several previous studies have tried to enhance
the spatial awareness of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by adding extra expert
encoders, which brings extra overhead and usually harms general capabilities.
To enhance the spatial ability in general architectures, we introduce Visual
Spatial Tuning (VST), a comprehensive framework to cultivate VLMs with
human-like visuospatial abilities, from spatial perception to reasoning. We
first attempt to enhance spatial perception in VLMs by constructing a
large-scale dataset termed VST-P, which comprises 4.1 million samples spanning
19 skills across single views, multiple images, and videos. Then, we present
VST-R, a curated dataset with 135K samples that instruct models to reason in
space. In particular, we adopt a progressive training pipeline: supervised
fine-tuning to build foundational spatial knowledge, followed by reinforcement
learning to further improve spatial reasoning abilities. Without the
side-effect to general capabilities, the proposed VST consistently achieves
state-of-the-art results on several spatial benchmarks, including $34.8\%$ on
MMSI-Bench and $61.2\%$ on VSIBench. It turns out that the
Vision-Language-Action models can be significantly enhanced with the proposed
spatial tuning paradigm, paving the way for more physically grounded AI.

### [68] [Stateful KV Cache Management for LLMs: Balancing Space, Time, Accuracy, and Positional Fidelity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04686)
*Pratik Poudel*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了KV缓存在多轮对话中的管理策略，发现当KV缓存接近模型训练上下文窗口时，生成质量会急剧下降。保持位置编码的连续性和结构完整性比复杂的缓存淘汰策略更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多轮对话场景中，KV缓存的无限制增长带来了重大挑战。现有研究往往忽视了位置编码完整性对生成质量的影响。

Method: 使用状态化基准测试框架进行实证分析，比较不同KV缓存淘汰策略（包括AttentionTop等高保留率策略）对模型生成质量的影响。

Result: 当累积KV缓存接近或超过模型训练上下文窗口（如Llama 3的8192 tokens）时，生成质量会急剧下降。保持连续上下文块的简单策略比复杂的位置破坏性策略能产生更连贯的生成结果。

Conclusion: KV缓存管理策略应尊重架构限制，保持位置结构完整性，并将"缓存健康"视为超越单纯大小的整体概念。

Abstract: The Key-Value (KV) cache is integral to efficient autoregressive inference in
large language models (LLMs), yet its unbounded growth in stateful multi-turn
scenarios presents major challenges. This paper examines the interplay between
KV cache management strategies, the architectural context limits of models like
meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8b-instruct, and the often-overlooked integrity of
positional encodings. Through empirical analysis using a stateful benchmarking
framework, we show that LLM generation quality degrades sharply when the
accumulated KV cache approaches or exceeds the model's trained context window
(e.g., 8192 tokens for Llama 3), a failure mode distinct from GPU memory
exhaustion. Common eviction strategies, even high-retention ones (e.g., 99% via
AttentionTop), can worsen performance if they disrupt positional coherence.
Because LLMs rely on consistent positional signals (e.g., RoPE), compacting a
cache by removing non-contiguous tokens can scramble these signals and lead to
degenerative outputs. We further show that simple strategies preserving
contiguous context blocks (e.g., keeping an initial "gist") can yield more
coherent generations than complex or positionally disruptive ones. We advocate
for eviction techniques that respect architectural limits, preserve positional
structure, and view "cache health" holistically beyond mere size.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的rs-fMRI分析框架，通过自适应级联分解学习任务相关的频率子带，并构建统一的功能网络来捕捉跨频带交互，提高脑部疾病诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有rs-fMRI模型大多忽视神经元振荡的多频特性，将BOLD信号视为单一时间序列，无法捕捉神经疾病在特定频带的异常表现，限制了诊断的敏感性和特异性。

Method: 采用自适应级联分解学习每个脑区的任务相关频率子带，通过频率耦合连接学习构建统一功能网络，使用统一图卷积网络进行消息传递和节点表示学习。

Result: 在ADNI和ABIDE数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效捕捉脑功能连接的多频特性，为脑部疾病诊断提供了更敏感和特异的工具。

Abstract: Resting-state fMRI has become a valuable tool for classifying brain disorders
and constructing brain functional connectivity networks
  by tracking BOLD signals across brain regions. However, existing mod els
largely neglect the multi-frequency nature of neuronal oscillations,
  treating BOLD signals as monolithic time series. This overlooks the cru cial
fact that neurological disorders often manifest as disruptions within
  specific frequency bands, limiting diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
  While some methods have attempted to incorporate frequency informa tion, they
often rely on predefined frequency bands, which may not be
  optimal for capturing individual variability or disease-specific alterations.
  To address this, we propose a novel framework featuring Adaptive Cas cade
Decomposition to learn task-relevant frequency sub-bands for each
  brain region and Frequency-Coupled Connectivity Learning to capture
  both intra- and nuanced cross-band interactions in a unified functional
  network. This unified network informs a novel message-passing mecha nism
within our Unified-GCN, generating refined node representations
  for diagnostic prediction. Experimental results on the ADNI and ABIDE
  datasets demonstrate superior performance over existing methods. The

*Qianyang Li,Xingjun Zhang,Peng Tao,Shaoxun Wang,Yancheng Pan,Jia Wei*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: AWEMixer是一种自适应小波增强混合网络，用于解决物联网环境中长期时间序列预测的挑战，通过结合全局频率信息和局部时频特征来提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网传感器信号具有非平稳性和多尺度特性，传统方法在时间域操作受限，傅里叶变换获得的全局频率信息被视为平稳信号会模糊瞬态事件的时间模式，误差累积导致长期预测质量下降。

Method: 提出AWEMixer网络，包含两个创新组件：1）频率路由器利用快速傅里叶变换获得的全局周期性模式自适应加权局部小波子带；2）相干门控融合块通过交叉注意力和门控机制实现突出频率特征与多尺度时间表示的选择性集成。

Result: 在七个公共基准测试中验证，该模型比最近的state-of-the-art模型更有效，在长序列时间序列预测中相比基于transformer和MLP的先进模型持续实现性能提升。

Conclusion: AWEMixer能够实现精确的时频定位，同时对噪声保持鲁棒性，代码已开源。

Abstract: Forecasting long-term time series in IoT environments remains a significant
challenge due to the non-stationary and multi-scale characteristics of sensor
signals. Furthermore, error accumulation causes a decrease in forecast quality
when predicting further into the future. Traditional methods are restricted to
operate in time-domain, while the global frequency information achieved by
Fourier transform would be regarded as stationary signals leading to blur the
temporal patterns of transient events. We propose AWEMixer, an Adaptive
Wavelet-Enhanced Mixer Network including two innovative components: 1) a
Frequency Router designs to utilize the global periodicity pattern achieved by
Fast Fourier Transform to adaptively weight localized wavelet subband, and 2) a
Coherent Gated Fusion Block to achieve selective integration of prominent
frequency features with multi-scale temporal representation through
cross-attention and gating mechanism, which realizes accurate time-frequency
localization while remaining robust to noise. Seven public benchmarks validate
that our model is more effective than recent state-of-the-art models.
Specifically, our model consistently achieves performance improvement compared
with transformer-based and MLP-based state-of-the-art models in long-sequence
time series forecasting. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合TCN和改良TFT的新型RUL预测框架，通过多时间窗口方法提高适应性，在基准数据集上平均RMSE降低5.5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RUL预测模型难以捕捉细粒度时间依赖性，且无法动态优先处理关键特征，影响预测稳健性。

Method: 集成时间卷积网络(TCN)进行局部时间特征提取，结合由Bi-LSTM编码器-解码器增强的改良时间融合变换器(TFT)，采用多时间窗口方法。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛评估表明，该模型平均RMSE降低高达5.5%，预测精度优于现有先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架弥补了现有方法的不足，推进了工业预测系统的有效性，凸显了先进时间序列变换器在RUL预测中的潜力。

Abstract: Health prediction is crucial for ensuring reliability, minimizing downtime,
and optimizing maintenance in industrial systems. Remaining Useful Life (RUL)
prediction is a key component of this process; however, many existing models
struggle to capture fine-grained temporal dependencies while dynamically
prioritizing critical features across time for robust prognostics. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel framework that integrates Temporal
Convolutional Networks (TCNs) for localized temporal feature extraction with a
modified Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) enhanced by Bi-LSTM encoder-decoder.
This architecture effectively bridges short- and long-term dependencies while
emphasizing salient temporal patterns. Furthermore, the incorporation of a
multi-time-window methodology improves adaptability across diverse operating
conditions. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed model reduces the average RMSE by up to 5.5%, underscoring its
improved predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. By closing
critical gaps in current approaches, this framework advances the effectiveness
of industrial prognostic systems and highlights the potential of advanced
time-series transformers for RUL prediction.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了GLISp的传感器引导正则化扩展，通过物理信息假设函数和最小二乘正则化项将可测量描述符集成到偏好学习循环中，结合主观反馈和定量传感器信息，相比基线GLISp在收敛速度和最终解质量上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人机交互校准方法如Preferential Bayesian Optimization或GLISp将系统视为黑盒，忽略了信息丰富的传感器测量数据。

Method: 传感器引导正则化GLISp扩展，通过物理信息假设函数和最小二乘正则化项将可测量描述符集成到偏好学习循环中，注入灰盒结构。

Result: 在分析基准和人机交互车辆悬架调优任务上的数值评估显示，相比基线GLISp具有更快的收敛速度和更优的最终解。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了主观偏好反馈和定量传感器信息，在保持基于偏好的搜索灵活性的同时提高了性能。

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop calibration is often addressed via preference-based
optimization, where algorithms learn from pairwise comparisons rather than
explicit cost evaluations. While effective, methods such as Preferential
Bayesian Optimization or Global optimization based on active preference
learning with radial basis functions (GLISp) treat the system as a black box
and ignore informative sensor measurements. In this work, we introduce a
sensor-guided regularized extension of GLISp that integrates measurable
descriptors into the preference-learning loop through a physics-informed
hypothesis function and a least-squares regularization term. This injects
grey-box structure, combining subjective feedback with quantitative sensor
information while preserving the flexibility of preference-based search.
Numerical evaluations on an analytical benchmark and on a human-in-the-loop
vehicle suspension tuning task show faster convergence and superior final
solutions compared to baseline GLISp.

### [73] [When Data Falls Short: Grokking Below the Critical Threshold](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04760)
*Vaibhav Singh,Eugene Belilovsky,Rahaf Aljundi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了grokking现象（模型在训练数据上过拟合后出现延迟泛化），重点探讨了数据稀缺和分布偏移场景下知识蒸馏（KD）如何诱导和加速grokking。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在数据量低于临界阈值时grokking不可观察的情况，以及实际部署中模型需要适应新分布但数据有限的挑战。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术：1）从已在分布p1上grokked的模型蒸馏到新分布p2；2）在联合分布(p1,p2)上训练；3）持续预训练设置下从p1转移到p2。

Result: KD能诱导和加速grokking，即使数据低于临界阈值；在联合分布训练中，从单个分布grokked模型蒸馏可实现泛化；在持续学习中，KD加速泛化并减轻灾难性遗忘，仅需10%数据即可获得强性能。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了知识转移下grokking的机制，强调了KD在低数据和动态分布场景中实现泛化的核心作用。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the phenomenon of grokking, where models
exhibit delayed generalization following overfitting on training data. We focus
on data-scarce regimes where the number of training samples falls below the
critical threshold, making grokking unobservable, and on practical scenarios
involving distribution shift. We first show that Knowledge Distillation (KD)
from a model that has already grokked on a distribution (p1) can induce and
accelerate grokking on a different distribution (p2), even when the available
data lies below the critical threshold. This highlights the value of KD for
deployed models that must adapt to new distributions under limited data. We
then study training on the joint distribution (p1, p2) and demonstrate that
while standard supervised training fails when either distribution has
insufficient data, distilling from models grokked on the individual
distributions enables generalization. Finally, we examine a continual
pretraining setup, where a grokked model transitions from p1 to p2, and find
that KD both accelerates generalization and mitigates catastrophic forgetting,
achieving strong performance even with only 10% of the data. Together, our
results provide new insights into the mechanics of grokking under knowledge
transfer and underscore the central role of KD in enabling generalization in
low-data and evolving distribution settings.

TL;DR: FuseFlow是一个编译器，将PyTorch稀疏模型转换为融合稀疏数据流图，支持跨表达式融合，是首个支持通用稀疏操作跨表达式融合的编译器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型规模扩大，稀疏计算和专用数据流硬件成为提高效率的重要方案。需要开发能够有效处理稀疏模型的编译器技术。

Method: 提出FuseFlow编译器，支持跨内核融合、并行化、数据流排序和稀疏分块等优化，针对可重构数据流架构，使用周期精确数据流模拟器进行微架构分析。

Result: 在四个真实稀疏机器学习应用中验证，发现完全融合并非总是最优，融合粒度取决于模型本身。在GPT-3 BigBird块稀疏注意力上实现约2.7倍加速。

Conclusion: FuseFlow为稀疏模型提供有效的融合策略探索，提出启发式方法识别和剪枝次优配置，证明融合策略需要根据具体模型定制。

Abstract: As deep learning models scale, sparse computation and specialized dataflow
hardware have emerged as powerful solutions to address efficiency. We propose
FuseFlow, a compiler that converts sparse machine learning models written in
PyTorch to fused sparse dataflow graphs for reconfigurable dataflow
architectures (RDAs). FuseFlow is the first compiler to support general
cross-expression fusion of sparse operations. In addition to fusion across
kernels (expressions), FuseFlow also supports optimizations like
parallelization, dataflow ordering, and sparsity blocking. It targets a
cycle-accurate dataflow simulator for microarchitectural analysis of fusion
strategies. We use FuseFlow for design-space exploration across four real-world
machine learning applications with sparsity, showing that full fusion (entire
cross-expression fusion across all computation in an end-to-end model) is not
always optimal for sparse models-fusion granularity depends on the model
itself. FuseFlow also provides a heuristic to identify and prune suboptimal
configurations. Using Fuseflow, we achieve performance improvements, including
a ~2.7x speedup over an unfused baseline for GPT-3 with BigBird block-sparse
attention.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对云工作负载的指令预取设计，通过压缩条目、分层元数据存储和在线机器学习控制器来优化指令预取效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模网络服务依赖深度软件栈和微服务编排，导致指令足迹增加和前端停顿，从而增加了尾延迟和能耗。需要重新审视指令预取技术以适应云工作负载。

Method: 基于纠缠指令预取器（EIP），引入压缩条目（利用空间聚类捕获最多8个目标）、分层元数据存储方案（仅保留L1常驻和频繁查询的条目在芯片上），以及轻量级在线ML控制器（使用上下文特征和bandit调整阈值评分预取收益）。

Result: 在数据中心应用中，该方法在保持类似EIP加速效果的同时，减少了芯片上状态大小，并提高了网络服务在ML时代的效率。

Conclusion: 该设计为云工作负载提供了高效的指令预取解决方案，通过压缩和分层存储优化了资源利用，结合在线ML控制实现了自优化系统。

Abstract: Large-scale networked services rely on deep soft-ware stacks and microservice
orchestration, which increase instruction footprints and create frontend stalls
that inflate tail latency and energy. We revisit instruction prefetching for
these cloud workloads and present a design that aligns with SLO driven and self
optimizing systems. Building on the Entangling Instruction Prefetcher (EIP), we
introduce a Compressed Entry that captures up to eight destinations around a
base using 36 bits by exploiting spatial clustering, and a Hierarchical
Metadata Storage scheme that keeps only L1 resident and frequently queried
entries on chip while virtualizing bulk metadata into lower levels. We further
add a lightweight Online ML Controller that scores prefetch profitability using
context features and a bandit adjusted threshold. On data center applications,
our approach preserves EIP like speedups with smaller on chip state and
improves efficiency for networked services in the ML era.

Motivation: 帕金森病存在异质性的脑形态变化轨迹，现有方法难以处理不规则采样的MRI数据，且无法有效捕捉个体差异如发病时间、进展速度和症状严重程度。

Method: CNODE框架通过神经ODE模型将脑形态变化建模为连续时间过程，联合学习患者特定的初始时间和进展速度，将个体轨迹对齐到共享的进展轨迹中。

Result: 在PPMI数据集上的实验表明，CNODE在纵向帕金森病进展预测任务上优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CNODE能够有效建模帕金森病的异质性进展模式，为疾病机制研究、治疗开发和个体化预测提供了新方法。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) shows heterogeneous, evolving brain-morphometry
patterns. Modeling these longitudinal trajectories enables mechanistic insight,
treatment development, and individualized 'digital-twin' forecasting. However,
existing methods usually adopt recurrent neural networks and transformer
architectures, which rely on discrete, regularly sampled data while struggling
to handle irregular and sparse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in PD cohorts.
Moreover, these methods have difficulty capturing individual heterogeneity
including variations in disease onset, progression rate, and symptom severity,
which is a hallmark of PD. To address these challenges, we propose CNODE
(Conditional Neural ODE), a novel framework for continuous, individualized PD
progression forecasting. The core of CNODE is to model morphological brain
changes as continuous temporal processes using a neural ODE model. In addition,
we jointly learn patient-specific initial time and progress speed to align
individual trajectories into a shared progression trajectory. We validate CNODE
on the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) dataset. Experimental
results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
forecasting longitudinal PD progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表示学习在预测任务中表现优异，但在因果任务（如干预效果预测）中表现不佳，因此需要结合因果推断方法。多模态数据的可用性为这一结合提供了机会。

Method: 提出一个统计和计算框架，利用观察性和扰动性多模态数据，进行因果发现、学习因果变量以及设计最优扰动。

Conclusion: 结合表示学习与因果推断，利用多模态数据，有望在生物医学等领域推动更可靠的因果发现和决策支持。

Abstract: Massive data collection holds the promise of a better understanding of
complex phenomena and, ultimately, better decisions. Representation learning
has become a key driver of deep learning applications, as it allows learning
latent spaces that capture important properties of the data without requiring
any supervised annotations. Although representation learning has been hugely
successful in predictive tasks, it can fail miserably in causal tasks including
predicting the effect of a perturbation/intervention. This calls for a marriage
between representation learning and causal inference. An exciting opportunity
in this regard stems from the growing availability of multi-modal data
(observational and perturbational, imaging-based and sequencing-based, at the
single-cell level, tissue-level, and organism-level). We outline a statistical
and computational framework for causal structure and representation learning
motivated by fundamental biomedical questions: how to effectively use
observational and perturbational data to perform causal discovery on observed
causal variables; how to use multi-modal views of the system to learn causal
variables; and how to design optimal perturbations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DuetServe是一个统一的LLM服务框架，通过在单个GPU内实现细粒度的SM级空间复用，动态分离prefill和decode阶段，在保持低延迟的同时提高吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统要么在共享GPU上聚合prefill和decode阶段导致干扰，要么跨GPU分离阶段造成资源浪费。需要一种既能保持隔离效果又避免资源重复的方案。

Method: 采用注意力感知的屋顶线模型预测迭代延迟，分区优化器选择最优SM分割方案，无中断执行引擎消除CPU-GPU同步开销，实现动态的SM级GPU空间复用。

Result: 评估显示DuetServe相比最先进框架，总吞吐量提升高达1.3倍，同时保持低生成延迟。

Conclusion: DuetServe证明了在单个GPU内通过细粒度动态分区可以实现prefill和decode阶段的有效隔离，为LLM服务提供了资源高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern LLM serving systems must sustain high throughput while meeting strict
latency SLOs across two distinct inference phases: compute-intensive prefill
and memory-bound decode phases. Existing approaches either (1) aggregate both
phases on shared GPUs, leading to interference between prefill and decode
phases, which degrades time-between-tokens (TBT); or (2) disaggregate the two
phases across GPUs, improving latency but wasting resources through duplicated
models and KV cache transfers. We present DuetServe, a unified LLM serving
framework that achieves disaggregation-level isolation within a single GPU.
DuetServe operates in aggregated mode by default and dynamically activates
SM-level GPU spatial multiplexing when TBT degradation is predicted. Its key
idea is to decouple prefill and decode execution only when needed through
fine-grained, adaptive SM partitioning that provides phase isolation only when
contention threatens latency service level objectives (SLOs). DuetServe
integrates (1) an attention-aware roofline model to forecast iteration latency,
(2) a partitioning optimizer that selects the optimal SM split to maximize
throughput under TBT constraints, and (3) an interruption-free execution engine
that eliminates CPU-GPU synchronization overhead. Evaluations show that
DuetServe improves total throughput by up to 1.3x while maintaining low
generation latency compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统MLP和KAN等网络在参数效率、可解释性和理论基础方面的不足，提供一种紧凑且理论上有保障的替代方案。

Method: 使用度数为m的Bernstein-Bezier多项式与轻量可逆变换结合，通过端到端训练，包括形状正则化、半离散最优传输覆盖和可微分边翻转。

Result: 在合成逼近任务、表格回归/分类以及作为紧凑CNN的替代头时，SiFEN在相同参数预算下匹配或超越MLP和KAN，提高了校准性并降低了推理延迟。

Conclusion: SiFEN提供了一种紧凑、可解释且理论上有保障的替代方案，适用于需要高效、可解释和理论支持的机器学习任务。

Abstract: We introduce Simplex-FEM Networks (SiFEN), a learned piecewise-polynomial
predictor that represents f: R^d -> R^k as a globally C^r finite-element field
on a learned simplicial mesh in an optionally warped input space. Each query
activates exactly one simplex and at most d+1 basis functions via barycentric
coordinates, yielding explicit locality, controllable smoothness, and
cache-friendly sparsity. SiFEN pairs degree-m Bernstein-Bezier polynomials with
a light invertible warp and trains end-to-end with shape regularization,
semi-discrete OT coverage, and differentiable edge flips. Under standard
shape-regularity and bi-Lipschitz warp assumptions, SiFEN achieves the classic
FEM approximation rate M^(-m/d) with M mesh vertices. Empirically, on synthetic
approximation tasks, tabular regression/classification, and as a drop-in head
on compact CNNs, SiFEN matches or surpasses MLPs and KANs at matched parameter
budgets, improves calibration (lower ECE/Brier), and reduces inference latency
due to geometric locality. These properties make SiFEN a compact,
interpretable, and theoretically grounded alternative to dense MLPs and
edge-spline networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PuzzleMoE是一种无需训练的MoE模型压缩方法，通过稀疏专家合并和位压缩编码技术，能在保持精度的同时实现高达50%的压缩率和1.28倍推理加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然通过激活少量专家实现了高效扩展，但由于需要存储所有专家参数，存在高内存开销问题，限制了其广泛应用。现有压缩方法在高压缩比下往往导致性能下降。

Method: 1. 稀疏专家合并：通过识别权重冗余和专业化，使用双掩码捕捉共享和专家特定参数；2. 位压缩编码：复用未充分利用的指数位，避免存储二进制掩码和符号的开销。

Result: 实验表明PuzzleMoE能在保持精度的同时压缩MoE模型达50%，在MMLU任务上比现有方法提升16.7%，推理速度提升1.28倍。

Conclusion: PuzzleMoE提供了一种高效的无训练MoE压缩方案，解决了高压缩比下的性能下降问题，为MoE模型的广泛部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have shown strong potential in scaling
language models efficiently by activating only a small subset of experts per
input. However, their widespread deployment remains limited due to the high
memory overhead associated with storing all expert parameters, particularly as
the number of experts increases. To address this challenge, prior works have
explored expert dropping and merging strategies, yet they often suffer from
performance drop at high compression ratios. In this paper, we introduce
PuzzleMoE, a training-free MoE compression method that achieves both high
accuracy and efficient inference through two key innovations: First, PuzzleMoE
performs sparse expert merging by identifying element-wise weight redundancy
and specialization. It uses a dual-mask to capture both shared and
expert-specific parameters. Second, to avoid the overhead of storing binary
masks and signs, PuzzleMoE introduces a bit-packed encoding scheme that reuses
underutilized exponent bits, enabling efficient MoE inference on GPUs.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PuzzleMoE can compress MoE models by up
to 50% while maintaining accuracy across various tasks. Specifically, it
outperforms prior MoE compression methods by up to 16.7% on MMLU at 50%
compression ratio, and achieves up to 1.28\times inference speedup.

TL;DR: 本文分析了自动编码器的拓扑限制和能力，特别是在数据流形上的应用，并探讨了其在动力系统不变流形上的编码能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自动编码器在数据流形上的拓扑特性，理解其编码和解码过程的理论限制，以及如何应用于动力系统的不变流形。

Method: 通过数学分析自动编码器的连续映射对（编码器和解码器），研究其在数据流形上的逼近能力，并扩展到动力系统的应用。

Result: 揭示了自动编码器在拓扑上的固有局限性，同时展示了其在动力系统不变流形编码中的潜在能力。

Conclusion: 自动编码器在数据流形上存在拓扑限制，但在动力系统的不变流形编码中具有应用潜力，为后续研究提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Given a "data manifold" $M\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and "latent space"
$\mathbb{R}^\ell$, an autoencoder is a pair of continuous maps consisting of an
"encoder" $E\colon \mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^\ell$ and "decoder" $D\colon
\mathbb{R}^\ell\to \mathbb{R}^n$ such that the "round trip" map $D\circ E$ is
as close as possible to the identity map $\mbox{id}_M$ on $M$. We present
various topological limitations and capabilites inherent to the search for an
autoencoder, and describe capabilities for autoencoding dynamical systems
having $M$ as an invariant manifold.

### [82] [Sharp Minima Can Generalize: A Loss Landscape Perspective On Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04808)
*Raymond Fan,Bryce Sandlund,Lin Myat Ko*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文挑战了深度学习中的体积假说，指出大容量数据集通过改变损失函数景观，使得原本体积小但泛化能力强的极小值变得相对更大，从而更容易被找到。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 体积假说认为深度学习有效是因为平坦极小值体积大，但这无法解释大数据集在泛化中的作用。作者旨在探究数据量如何影响极小值体积与泛化能力的关系。

Method: 通过在不同训练数据量下测量极小值的体积，分析损失函数景观的变化。

Result: 研究发现存在体积小但泛化能力强的尖锐极小值，但这些极小值由于体积小而不容易被找到。增加数据量会改变损失景观，使得这些泛化好的极小值相对体积变大。

Conclusion: 大数据集的作用不仅仅是提供更多训练样本，更重要的是改变了优化景观，使得泛化能力强的极小值更容易被深度学习算法发现。

Abstract: The volume hypothesis suggests deep learning is effective because it is
likely to find flat minima due to their large volumes, and flat minima
generalize well. This picture does not explain the role of large datasets in
generalization. Measuring minima volumes under varying amounts of training data
reveals sharp minima which generalize well exist, but are unlikely to be found
due to their small volumes. Increasing data changes the loss landscape, such
that previously small generalizing minima become (relatively) large.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 抗菌肽作为对抗抗生素耐药性的有前景分子，但数据集碎片化、注释不一致和缺乏标准化基准阻碍了计算方法的发展和新候选肽的发现。

Method: 提出了ESCAPE实验框架，整合27个验证数据库的8万多肽序列，构建多标签层次结构分类；基于此开发了利用序列和结构信息的transformer模型来预测肽的多功能活性。

Result: 该方法在平均精度均值上相对于第二好方法实现了2.56%的相对改进，建立了多标签肽分类的新最先进水平。

Conclusion: ESCAPE为推进AI驱动的抗菌肽研究提供了一个全面且可重复的评估框架。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides have emerged as promising molecules to combat
antimicrobial resistance. However, fragmented datasets, inconsistent
annotations, and the lack of standardized benchmarks hinder computational
approaches and slow down the discovery of new candidates. To address these
challenges, we present the Expanded Standardized Collection for Antimicrobial
Peptide Evaluation (ESCAPE), an experimental framework integrating over 80.000
peptides from 27 validated repositories. Our dataset separates antimicrobial
peptides from negative sequences and incorporates their functional annotations
into a biologically coherent multilabel hierarchy, capturing activities across
antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiparasitic classes. Building on
ESCAPE, we propose a transformer-based model that leverages sequence and
structural information to predict multiple functional activities of peptides.
Our method achieves up to a 2.56% relative average improvement in mean Average
Precision over the second-best method adapted for this task, establishing a new
state-of-the-art multilabel peptide classification. ESCAPE provides a
comprehensive and reproducible evaluation framework to advance AI-driven
antimicrobial peptide research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索PRH在有向图数据分析中的有效性，特别是在癫痫检测这一重要神经科学问题中的应用，旨在验证PRH相比传统DPH方法的优势。

Method: 使用Betti曲线及其积分作为拓扑特征，在支持向量机上实现分类流程，比较PRH和DPH在分类任务中的表现。

Result: 研究表明PRH在分类任务中优于DPH，主要优势在于PRH考虑了过滤过程中出现的缩合有向图，计算基于更小的图结构。

Conclusion: PRH是分析有向图数据的一种有效方法，在癫痫检测等网络分类任务中表现出比传统DPH方法更好的性能。

Abstract: We explore the recently introduced persistent reachability homology (PRH) of
digraph data, i.e. data in the form of directed graphs. In particular, we study
the effectiveness of PRH in network classification task in a key neuroscience
problem: epilepsy detection. PRH is a variation of the persistent homology of
digraphs, more traditionally based on the directed flag complex (DPH). A main
advantage of PRH is that it considers the condensations of the digraphs
appearing in the persistent filtration and thus is computed from smaller
digraphs. We compare the effectiveness of PRH to that of DPH and we show that
PRH outperforms DPH in the classification task. We use the Betti curves and
their integrals as topological features and implement our pipeline on support
vector machine.

TL;DR: 提出一种通过概念反演获得隐式负嵌入的方法，替换训练自由方法中的负提示，解决微调模型和训练自由引导方法结合时防御性能下降的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像生成模型防御方法（模型微调和训练自由引导）在结合使用时会出现性能下降，存在不兼容问题。

Method: 使用概念反演技术获得隐式负嵌入，替代训练自由方法中的负提示，无需修改现有方法即可集成到现有流程中。

Result: 在色情和暴力基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，防御成功率得到一致提升，同时保持了输入提示的核心语义。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，解决了两种防御范式的不兼容问题，为生成模型的安全防护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image generative models have raised concerns about
their potential to produce harmful content when provided with malicious input
text prompts. To address this issue, two main approaches have emerged: (1)
fine-tuning the model to unlearn harmful concepts and (2) training-free
guidance methods that leverage negative prompts. However, we observe that
combining these two orthogonal approaches often leads to marginal or even
degraded defense performance. This observation indicates a critical
incompatibility between two paradigms, which hinders their combined
effectiveness. In this work, we address this issue by proposing a conceptually
simple yet experimentally robust method: replacing the negative prompts used in
training-free methods with implicit negative embeddings obtained through
concept inversion. Our method requires no modification to either approach and
can be easily integrated into existing pipelines. We experimentally validate
its effectiveness on nudity and violence benchmarks, demonstrating consistent
improvements in defense success rate while preserving the core semantics of
input prompts.

*Brenda Nogueira,Meng Jiang,Nitesh V. Chawla,Nuno Moniz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPECTRA是一个光谱目标感知的图增强框架，通过光谱域插值生成真实的分子图，解决分子属性预测中稀有化合物预测性能差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准图神经网络在优化平均误差时，对稀疏区域的高价值化合物（如高效力分子）预测性能不佳，现有过采样方法常常扭曲分子拓扑结构。

Method: SPECTRA框架包括：(i)从SMILES重建多属性分子图；(ii)通过Gromov-Wasserstein耦合对齐分子对；(iii)在稳定共享基中插值拉普拉斯特征值、特征向量和节点特征；(iv)重建边以合成具有插值目标的物理合理中间体。采用基于核密度估计的稀有感知预算方案。

Result: 在基准测试中，SPECTRA在相关目标范围内持续改善误差，同时保持竞争力的整体MAE，并生成可解释的合成分子，其结构反映了底层光谱几何。

Conclusion: 光谱、几何感知的增强是处理不平衡分子属性回归的有效且高效策略。

Abstract: In molecular property prediction, the most valuable compounds (e.g., high
potency) often occupy sparse regions of the target space. Standard Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) commonly optimize for the average error, underperforming on
these uncommon but critical cases, with existing oversampling methods often
distorting molecular topology. In this paper, we introduce SPECTRA, a Spectral
Target-Aware graph augmentation framework that generates realistic molecular
graphs in the spectral domain. SPECTRA (i) reconstructs multi-attribute
molecular graphs from SMILES; (ii) aligns molecule pairs via (Fused)
Gromov-Wasserstein couplings to obtain node correspondences; (iii) interpolates
Laplacian eigenvalues, eigenvectors and node features in a stable share-basis;
and (iv) reconstructs edges to synthesize physically plausible intermediates
with interpolated targets. A rarity-aware budgeting scheme, derived from a
kernel density estimation of labels, concentrates augmentation where data are
scarce. Coupled with a spectral GNN using edge-aware Chebyshev convolutions,
SPECTRA densifies underrepresented regions without degrading global accuracy.
On benchmarks, SPECTRA consistently improves error in relevant target ranges
while maintaining competitive overall MAE, and yields interpretable synthetic
molecules whose structure reflects the underlying spectral geometry. Our
results demonstrate that spectral, geometry-aware augmentation is an effective
and efficient strategy for imbalanced molecular property regression.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的SDE积分器DDRaM，通过使用随机中点来更好地近似SDE，在适当平滑性假设下实现了亚线性复杂度的DDPM采样。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的DDPM分析主要基于指数欧拉离散化，其收敛保证通常至少线性依赖于维度或初始Fisher信息。本文旨在开发一种更高效的采样算法，实现亚线性复杂度的纯DDPM采样。

Method: 提出了去噪扩散随机中点法（DDRaM），利用随机中点来改进SDE近似。使用"移位组合规则"分析框架，在适当平滑性假设下证明算法的离散化特性。

Result: DDRaM算法实现了亚线性复杂度O(√d)的分数评估需求，这是首个纯DDPM采样的亚线性复杂度界限。实验验证表明该方法在预训练图像合成模型中表现良好。

Conclusion: DDRaM是首个实现亚线性复杂度的纯DDPM采样方法，相比基于ODE的采样方法更贴近实际应用，为高效扩散模型采样提供了新思路。

Abstract: SDE-based methods such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs)
have shown remarkable success in real-world sample generation tasks. Prior
analyses of DDPMs have been focused on the exponential Euler discretization,
showing guarantees that generally depend at least linearly on the dimension or
initial Fisher information. Inspired by works in log-concave sampling (Shen and
Lee, 2019), we analyze an integrator -- the denoising diffusion randomized
midpoint method (DDRaM) -- that leverages an additional randomized midpoint to
better approximate the SDE. Using a recently-developed analytic framework
called the "shifted composition rule", we show that this algorithm enjoys
favorable discretization properties under appropriate smoothness assumptions,
with sublinear $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{d})$ score evaluations needed to ensure
convergence. This is the first sublinear complexity bound for pure DDPM
sampling -- prior works which obtained such bounds worked instead with
ODE-based sampling and had to make modifications to the sampler which deviate
from how they are used in practice. We also provide experimental validation of
the advantages of our method, showing that it performs well in practice with
pre-trained image synthesis models.

TL;DR: 使用机器学习模型分析美国消费者对具有创新运输证书食品的购买行为偏好，重点关注运输相关证书的价值


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于先前研究发现运输因素在消费者食品购买选择中具有显著影响，需要进一步识别消费者具体重视的运输属性

Method: 采用机器学习模型分析第二次实验数据，提出五种创新运输证书（运输模式、物联网、安全措施、能源来源、必须到达日期），并控制产品和决策者因素

Result: 研究发现消费者明显倾向于安全和能源相关的运输证书，同时分析了价格、产品类型、证书和决策者因素对购买选择的影响

Conclusion: 研究为改进食品供应链系统提供了数据驱动的建议，强调了运输证书在消费者决策中的重要性

Abstract: This paper utilizes a machine learning model to estimate the consumer's
behavior for food products with innovative transportation certificates in the
U.S. Building on previous research that examined demand for food products with
supply chain traceability using stated preference analysis, transportation
factors were identified as significant in consumer food purchasing choices.
Consequently, a second experiment was conducted to pinpoint the specific
transportation attributes valued by consumers. A machine learning model was
applied, and five innovative certificates related to transportation were
proposed: Transportation Mode, Internet of Things (IoT), Safety measures,
Energy Source, and Must Arrive By Dates (MABDs). The preference experiment also
incorporated product-specific and decision-maker factors for control purposes.
The findings reveal a notable inclination toward safety and energy certificates
within the transportation domain of the U.S. food supply chain. Additionally,
the study examined the influence of price, product type, certificates, and
decision-maker factors on purchasing choices. Ultimately, the study offers
data-driven recommendations for improving food supply chain systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出两种互补策略来解决LLM智能体在新环境中的泛化问题：在线分布适应和部署时动态基础化，显著提升了智能体在复杂环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在面对新环境和复杂场景时存在泛化困难，主要由于预训练与测试条件不匹配导致的语法和语义理解错误。

Method: 1. 在线分布适应方法：学习轻量级适应向量来偏置模型输出分布，快速适应环境响应格式；2. 部署时动态基础化：通过角色驱动探索阶段系统探测和学习环境因果动态，建立非参数化世界模型。

Result: 在WebArena多站点分割测试中，动态基础化方法将智能体成功率从2%提升至23%，两种策略在所有基准测试中都表现出有效性且计算成本最小。

Conclusion: 动态基础化在复杂环境中特别有效，为构建更通用和强大的LLM智能体提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and
complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to
a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions.
This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic
misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats,
and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only
revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and
complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging
environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online
distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by
learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output
distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format.
Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven
exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal
dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world
model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks,
including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the
effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal
computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective
in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle,
demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based
agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases
the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SigmaDock是一种基于SE(3)黎曼扩散模型的分子对接方法，通过分解配体为刚性片段并学习在结合口袋中重新组装这些片段，实现了最先进的对接性能，首次超越经典物理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成式分子对接方法存在化学不合理输出、泛化性差和计算成本高等问题，需要更有效的方法来改进配体-蛋白质结合构象的预测。

Method: 提出新颖的片段化方案，将配体分解为刚性片段，然后使用SE(3)黎曼扩散模型学习在结合口袋中重新组装这些片段，利用几何先验避免复杂扩散过程。

Result: 在PoseBusters数据集上达到79.9%的Top-1成功率（RMSD<2且PB有效），远超近期深度学习方法（12.7-30.8%），并展示了对未见蛋白质的一致泛化能力。

Conclusion: SigmaDock首次在PB训练-测试划分下超越经典物理对接方法，标志着深度学习在分子建模可靠性和可行性方面的重大突破。

Abstract: Determining the binding pose of a ligand to a protein, known as molecular
docking, is a fundamental task in drug discovery. Generative approaches promise
faster, improved, and more diverse pose sampling than physics-based methods,
but are often hindered by chemically implausible outputs, poor
generalisability, and high computational cost. To address these challenges, we
introduce a novel fragmentation scheme, leveraging inductive biases from
structural chemistry, to decompose ligands into rigid-body fragments. Building
on this decomposition, we present SigmaDock, an SE(3) Riemannian diffusion
model that generates poses by learning to reassemble these rigid bodies within
the binding pocket. By operating at the level of fragments in SE(3), SigmaDock
exploits well-established geometric priors while avoiding overly complex
diffusion processes and unstable training dynamics. Experimentally, we show
SigmaDock achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching Top-1 success rates
(RMSD<2 & PB-valid) above 79.9% on the PoseBusters set, compared to 12.7-30.8%
reported by recent deep learning approaches, whilst demonstrating consistent
generalisation to unseen proteins. SigmaDock is the first deep learning
approach to surpass classical physics-based docking under the PB train-test
split, marking a significant leap forward in the reliability and feasibility of
deep learning for molecular modelling.

Motivation: 解决连续控制中传统Q学习的不稳定性问题，通过结合量子计算和经典模型来提升强化学习在连续动作空间中的性能。

Method: 使用指数族先验分布处理可见单元，量子玻尔兹曼分布处理隐藏单元，构建混合量子经典模型；提出连续Q学习框架，用CSQBM分布采样替代全局最大化。

Result: CSQBM能够解析计算连续变量的梯度，可直接集成到Actor-Critic算法中，克服了连续控制中的不稳定性问题。

Conclusion: CSQBM为连续动作强化学习提供了有效的量子-经典混合解决方案，在减少量子资源需求的同时保持了模型的表达能力。

Abstract: We introduce theoretically grounded Continuous Semi-Quantum Boltzmann
Machines (CSQBMs) that supports continuous-action reinforcement learning. By
combining exponential-family priors over visible units with quantum Boltzmann
distributions over hidden units, CSQBMs yield a hybrid quantum-classical model
that reduces qubit requirements while retaining strong expressiveness.
Crucially, gradients with respect to continuous variables can be computed
analytically, enabling direct integration into Actor-Critic algorithms.
Building on this, we propose a continuous Q-learning framework that replaces
global maximization by efficient sampling from the CSQBM distribution, thereby
overcoming instability issues in continuous control.

TL;DR: FoodRL是一个基于强化学习的元学习框架，用于准确预测食品银行的高度波动性实物捐赠，在自然灾害等干扰期间表现优于传统方法，可帮助每年多分配170万份餐食。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食品银行在缓解粮食不安全方面至关重要，但传统预测模型由于不可预测的波动和概念漂移（如季节性变化和自然灾害）而无法保持一致的准确性。

Method: FoodRL采用强化学习元学习框架，基于近期表现和上下文信息对多样化预测模型进行聚类和动态加权。

Result: 在两个结构不同的美国食品银行（受野火影响的西海岸大型区域食品银行和受飓风影响的东海岸州级食品银行）的多年度数据评估中，FoodRL始终优于基线方法，特别是在中断或下降期间。

Conclusion: FoodRL通过提供更可靠和自适应的预测，展示了在人道主义供应链中进行自适应集成学习的巨大潜力，并能显著提高社会影响力。

Abstract: Food banks are crucial for alleviating food insecurity, but their
effectiveness hinges on accurately forecasting highly volatile in-kind
donations to ensure equitable and efficient resource distribution. Traditional
forecasting models often fail to maintain consistent accuracy due to
unpredictable fluctuations and concept drift driven by seasonal variations and
natural disasters such as hurricanes in the Southeastern U.S. and wildfires in
the West Coast. To address these challenges, we propose FoodRL, a novel
reinforcement learning (RL) based metalearning framework that clusters and
dynamically weights diverse forecasting models based on recent performance and
contextual information. Evaluated on multi-year data from two structurally
distinct U.S. food banks-one large regional West Coast food bank affected by
wildfires and another state-level East Coast food bank consistently impacted by
hurricanes, FoodRL consistently outperforms baseline methods, particularly
during periods of disruption or decline. By delivering more reliable and
adaptive forecasts, FoodRL can facilitate the redistribution of food equivalent
to 1.7 million additional meals annually, demonstrating its significant
potential for social impact as well as adaptive ensemble learning for
humanitarian supply chains.

Method: 使用深度强化学习训练自利的交通代理，通过简单的奖励设计，不直接纳入系统级目标，研究集体理性在不同场景中的涌现情况。

Result: 在各种场景中，集体理性持续涌现，表明这一特性具有鲁棒性。通过模拟证据验证了微观动态环境中集体理性出现的机制。

Conclusion: 研究表明可以利用先进学习方法（如联邦学习）在混合自动驾驶系统中实现自利驾驶代理之间的集体合作，为未来交通系统设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to be commercially available in the
near future, leading to mixed autonomy traffic consisting of both AVs and
human-driven vehicles (HVs). Although numerous studies have shown that AVs can
be deployed to benefit the overall traffic system performance by incorporating
system-level goals into their decision making, it is not clear whether the
benefits still exist when agents act out of self-interest -- a trait common to
all driving agents, both human and autonomous. This study aims to understand
whether self-interested AVs can bring benefits to all driving agents in mixed
autonomy traffic systems. The research is centered on the concept of collective
rationality (CR). This concept, originating from game theory and behavioral
economics, means that driving agents may cooperate collectively even when
pursuing individual interests. Our recent research has proven the existence of
CR in an analytical game-theoretical model and empirically in mixed
human-driven traffic. In this paper, we demonstrate that CR can be attained
among driving agents trained using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with a
simple reward design. We examine the extent to which self-interested traffic
agents can achieve CR without directly incorporating system-level objectives.
Results show that CR consistently emerges in various scenarios, which indicates
the robustness of this property. We also postulate a mechanism to explain the
emergence of CR in the microscopic and dynamic environment and verify it based
on simulation evidence. This research suggests the possibility of leveraging
advanced learning methods (such as federated learning) to achieve collective
cooperation among self-interested driving agents in mixed-autonomy systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MAC-Flow是一个简单但表达能力强的多智能体协调框架，通过流模型学习联合行为表示，然后蒸馏成去中心化的一步策略，在保持协调能力的同时实现快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在有效协调的两个要求（丰富的联合行为表示和实时高效行动能力）之间存在权衡：基于去噪扩散的方法能捕捉复杂协调但计算慢，而基于高斯策略的方法速度快但处理多智能体交互时脆弱。

Method: MAC-Flow首先学习基于流的联合行为表示，然后将其蒸馏成去中心化的一步策略，这些策略能保持协调能力同时实现快速执行。

Result: 在4个基准测试（包括12个环境和34个数据集）上，MAC-Flow缓解了性能和计算成本之间的权衡，推理速度比基于扩散的MARL方法快约14.5倍，同时保持良好性能，推理速度与先前基于高斯策略的离线MARL方法相当。

Conclusion: MAC-Flow成功解决了多智能体协调中表达能力和计算效率之间的权衡问题，为实时多智能体协调提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work presents MAC-Flow, a simple yet expressive framework for
multi-agent coordination. We argue that requirements of effective coordination
are twofold: (i) a rich representation of the diverse joint behaviors present
in offline data and (ii) the ability to act efficiently in real time. However,
prior approaches often sacrifice one for the other, i.e., denoising
diffusion-based solutions capture complex coordination but are computationally
slow, while Gaussian policy-based solutions are fast but brittle in handling
multi-agent interaction. MAC-Flow addresses this trade-off by first learning a
flow-based representation of joint behaviors, and then distilling it into
decentralized one-step policies that preserve coordination while enabling fast
execution. Across four different benchmarks, including $12$ environments and
$34$ datasets, MAC-Flow alleviates the trade-off between performance and
computational cost, specifically achieving about $\boldsymbol{\times14.5}$
faster inference compared to diffusion-based MARL methods, while maintaining
good performance. At the same time, its inference speed is similar to that of
prior Gaussian policy-based offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
methods.

Motivation: 探索标签自由RL方法在不同规模模型（0.5B到7B参数）上的泛化能力，特别是对于推理能力有限的小型模型的有效性。

Method: 提出了一种结合课程学习和数据筛选的标签自由RL方法：使用课程学习逐步引入更难的问题，在训练过程中屏蔽无多数投票的rollouts，并建立数据筛选流程生成具有预定义难度的样本。

Result: 实证分析显示标签自由RL高度依赖基础模型的推理能力，小模型性能往往低于基线水平。提出的方法在所有模型规模和推理能力上都实现了持续改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated the promise of
unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) methods for enhancing reasoning
capabilities without external supervision. However, the generalizability of
these label-free RL approaches to smaller base models with limited reasoning
capabilities remains unexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate
the performance of label-free RL methods across different model sizes and
reasoning strengths, from 0.5B to 7B parameters. Our empirical analysis reveals
critical limitations: label-free RL is highly dependent on the base model's
pre-existing reasoning capability, with performance often degrading below
baseline levels for weaker models. We find that smaller models fail to generate
sufficiently long or diverse chain-of-thought reasoning to enable effective
self-reflection, and that training data difficulty plays a crucial role in
determining success. To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet
effective method for label-free RL that utilizes curriculum learning to
progressively introduce harder problems during training and mask no-majority
rollouts during training. Additionally, we introduce a data curation pipeline
to generate samples with predefined difficulty. Our approach demonstrates
consistent improvements across all model sizes and reasoning capabilities,
providing a path toward more robust unsupervised RL that can bootstrap
reasoning abilities in resource-constrained models. We make our code available

TL;DR: SAD-Flower框架通过引入虚拟控制输入，为基于流匹配的规划方法提供状态约束、动作约束和动态一致性的形式化保证，无需重新训练即可满足新约束。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配规划方法缺乏对状态和动作约束的形式化保证，且无法确保动态一致性，这可能导致规划轨迹不安全或不可执行。

Method: 提出SAD-Flower框架，通过增强流匹配模型中的虚拟控制输入，利用非线性控制理论技术推导出有原则的指导，为约束满足提供形式化保证。

Result: 在多个任务上的实验表明，SAD-Flower在确保约束满足方面优于各种基于生成模型的基线方法。

Conclusion: SAD-Flower成功解决了流匹配规划中的安全性、可接受性和动态一致性问题，提供了一种无需重新训练即可满足新约束的有效方法。

Abstract: Flow matching (FM) has shown promising results in data-driven planning.
However, it inherently lacks formal guarantees for ensuring state and action
constraints, whose satisfaction is a fundamental and crucial requirement for
the safety and admissibility of planned trajectories on various systems.
Moreover, existing FM planners do not ensure the dynamical consistency, which
potentially renders trajectories inexecutable. We address these shortcomings by
proposing SAD-Flower, a novel framework for generating Safe, Admissible, and
Dynamically consistent trajectories. Our approach relies on an augmentation of
the flow with a virtual control input. Thereby, principled guidance can be
derived using techniques from nonlinear control theory, providing formal
guarantees for state constraints, action constraints, and dynamic consistency.
Crucially, SAD-Flower operates without retraining, enabling test-time
satisfaction of unseen constraints. Through extensive experiments across
several tasks, we demonstrate that SAD-Flower outperforms various
generative-model-based baselines in ensuring constraint satisfaction.

<details>

Abstract: Progress in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) requires challenging
benchmarks that assess the limits of current methods. However, existing
benchmarks often target narrow short-horizon challenges that do not adequately
stress the long-term dependencies and generalization capabilities inherent in
many multi-agent systems. To address this, we first present
\textit{Craftax-MA}: an extension of the popular open-ended RL environment,
Craftax, that supports multiple agents and evaluates a wide range of general
abilities within a single environment. Written in JAX, \textit{Craftax-MA} is
exceptionally fast with a training run using 250 million environment
interactions completing in under an hour. To provide a more compelling
challenge for MARL, we also present \textit{Craftax-Coop}, an extension
introducing heterogeneous agents, trading and more mechanics that require
complex cooperation among agents for success. We provide analysis demonstrating
that existing algorithms struggle with key challenges in this benchmark,
including long-horizon credit assignment, exploration and cooperation, and
argue for its potential to drive long-term research in MARL.

Abstract: Off-dynamics reinforcement learning (RL), where training and deployment
transition dynamics are different, can be formulated as learning in a robust
Markov decision process (RMDP) where uncertainties in transition dynamics are
imposed. Existing literature mostly assumes access to generative models
allowing arbitrary state-action queries or pre-collected datasets with a good
state coverage of the deployment environment, bypassing the challenge of
exploration. In this work, we study a more realistic and challenging setting
where the agent is limited to online interaction with the training environment.
To capture the intrinsic difficulty of exploration in online RMDPs, we
introduce the supremal visitation ratio, a novel quantity that measures the
mismatch between the training dynamics and the deployment dynamics. We show
that if this ratio is unbounded, online learning becomes exponentially hard. We
propose the first computationally efficient algorithm that achieves sublinear
regret in online RMDPs with $f$-divergence based transition uncertainties. We
also establish matching regret lower bounds, demonstrating that our algorithm
achieves optimal dependence on both the supremal visitation ratio and the
number of interaction episodes. Finally, we validate our theoretical results
through comprehensive numerical experiments.

Motivation: 多校准是算法公平性的重要概念，要求预测器在自身预测和群体成员关系上的条件预测正确。先前工作建立了多校准与可引出性（elicitation）的联系，但现有算法效率较低。本文旨在开发更高效的算法，解决oracle-efficient算法在多校准问题上的理论界限问题。

Method: 将多校准从群体成员函数推广到任意有界假设类，引入更强的交换多校准概念。提出基于在线不可知学习器的oracle-efficient算法，对有界顺序Rademacher复杂度的假设类和可引出属性Γ，实现T^{1/(r+1)}的ℓᵣ-交换多校准误差。

Result: 对于r=2的特殊情况，算法实现了T^{1/3}的ℓ₂-交换多校准误差，显著优于现有界限。这完全解决了[GJRR24]中提出的开放性问题，以强肯定方式证明了oracle-efficient算法可以达到√T ℓ₂-均值多校准误差。

Conclusion: 本文通过引入交换多校准和开发高效的oracle-based算法，在多校准理论方面取得了重要突破，不仅显著改进了误差界限，还完全解决了该领域的关键开放性问题，为多校准的实际应用提供了更高效的理论基础。

Abstract: Multicalibration [HJKRR18] is an algorithmic fairness perspective that
demands that the predictions of a predictor are correct conditional on
themselves and membership in a collection of potentially overlapping subgroups
of a population. The work of [NR23] established a surprising connection between
multicalibration for an arbitrary property $\Gamma$ (e.g., mean or median) and
property elicitation: a property $\Gamma$ can be multicalibrated if and only if
it is elicitable, where elicitability is the notion that the true property
value of a distribution can be obtained by solving a regression problem over
the distribution. In the online setting, [NR23] proposed an inefficient
algorithm that achieves $\sqrt T$ $\ell_2$-multicalibration error for a
hypothesis class of group membership functions and an elicitable property
$\Gamma$, after $T$ rounds of interaction between a forecaster and adversary.
  In this paper, we generalize multicalibration for an elicitable property
$\Gamma$ from group membership functions to arbitrary bounded hypothesis
classes and introduce a stronger notion -- swap multicalibration, following
[GKR23]. Subsequently, we propose an oracle-efficient algorithm which, when
given access to an online agnostic learner, achieves $T^{1/(r+1)}$
$\ell_r$-swap multicalibration error with high probability (for $r\ge2$) for a
hypothesis class with bounded sequential Rademacher complexity and an
elicitable property $\Gamma$. For the special case of $r=2$, this implies an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $T^{1/3}$ $\ell_2$-swap
multicalibration error, which significantly improves on the previously
established bounds for the problem [NR23, GMS25, LSS25a], and completely
resolves an open question raised in [GJRR24] on the possibility of an
oracle-efficient algorithm that achieves $\sqrt{T}$ $\ell_2$-mean
multicalibration error by answering it in a strongly affirmative sense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决决策导向学习中的扩展性问题，现有方法需要频繁调用优化器，计算成本高昂。

Method: 使用对偶变量构建损失函数，定期求解下游问题，在更新间隔内使用简单可微的替代损失进行训练。

Result: DGL在两种问题类型上达到或超过现有最先进方法，同时大幅减少优化器调用次数和训练时间。

Conclusion: DGL是一种简单、可扩展的方法，能够有效平衡决策对齐和计算效率。

Abstract: Many real-world decisions are made under uncertainty by solving optimization
problems using predicted quantities. This predict-then-optimize paradigm has
motivated decision-focused learning, which trains models with awareness of how
the optimizer uses predictions, improving the performance of downstream
decisions. Despite its promise, scaling is challenging: state-of-the-art
methods either differentiate through a solver or rely on task-specific
surrogates, both of which require frequent and expensive calls to an optimizer,
often a combinatorial one. In this paper, we leverage dual variables from the
downstream problem to shape learning and introduce Dual-Guided Loss (DGL), a
simple, scalable objective that preserves decision alignment while reducing
solver dependence. We construct DGL specifically for combinatorial selection
problems with natural one-of-many constraints, such as matching, knapsack, and
shortest path. Our approach (a) decouples optimization from gradient updates by
solving the downstream problem only periodically; (b) between refreshes, trains
on dual-adjusted targets using simple differentiable surrogate losses; and (c)
as refreshes become less frequent, drives training cost toward standard
supervised learning while retaining strong decision alignment. We prove that
DGL has asymptotically diminishing decision regret, analyze runtime complexity,
and show on two problem classes that DGL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art
DFL methods while using far fewer solver calls and substantially less training
time. Code is available at https://github.com/paularodr/Dual-Guided-Learning.

Motivation: 大语言模型遗忘对于监管合规和构建符合伦理的AI系统至关重要，需要避免产生私有、有毒、非法或受版权保护的内容。

Method: 引入leak@k元评估指标，量化在k个样本生成中被遗忘知识重新出现的可能性，使用TOFU、MUSE和WMDP三个基准进行大规模系统性研究。

Result: 研究发现知识泄露在不同方法和任务中持续存在，现有最先进的遗忘技术仅提供有限的遗忘效果。

Conclusion: 当前遗忘方法存在严重漏洞，需要在概率解码下进行更严格评估，迫切需要开发更鲁棒的大语言模型遗忘方法。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is critical for regulatory
compliance and for building ethical generative AI systems that avoid producing
private, toxic, illegal, or copyrighted content. Despite rapid progress, in
this work we show that \textit{almost all} existing unlearning methods fail to
achieve true forgetting in practice. Specifically, while evaluations of these
`unlearned' models under deterministic (greedy) decoding often suggest
successful knowledge removal using standard benchmarks (as has been done in the
literature), we show that sensitive information reliably resurfaces when models
are sampled with standard probabilistic decoding. To rigorously capture this
vulnerability, we introduce \texttt{leak@$k$}, a new meta-evaluation metric
that quantifies the likelihood of forgotten knowledge reappearing when
generating $k$ samples from the model under realistic decoding strategies.
Using three widely adopted benchmarks, TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP, we conduct the
first large-scale, systematic study of unlearning reliability using our newly
defined \texttt{leak@$k$} metric. Our findings demonstrate that knowledge
leakage persists across methods and tasks, underscoring that current
state-of-the-art unlearning techniques provide only limited forgetting and
highlighting the urgent need for more robust approaches to LLM unlearning.

Motivation: 现有研究主要针对已知平衡权重和信噪比高的情况，但完全未知设置下EM算法的理论行为尚不明确，其轨迹和收敛阶数未被充分表征。

Method: 推导了所有信噪比下2MLR的显式EM更新表达式，分析其结构特性和摆线轨迹，建立了子最优角度的递推关系，并量化统计误差界限。

Conclusion: 本文提出了基于轨迹的分析框架，建立了任意初始化下的有限样本收敛保证，为混合线性回归中EM算法分析提供了新视角。

Abstract: This work investigates the structural properties, cycloid trajectories, and
non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR) with unknown mixing
weights and regression parameters. Recent studies have established global
convergence for 2MLR with known balanced weights and super-linear convergence
in noiseless and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. However, the
theoretical behavior of EM in the fully unknown setting remains unclear, with
its trajectory and convergence order not yet fully characterized. We derive
explicit EM update expressions for 2MLR with unknown mixing weights and
regression parameters across all SNR regimes and analyze their structural
properties and cycloid trajectories. In the noiseless case, we prove that the
trajectory of the regression parameters in EM iterations traces a cycloid by
establishing a recurrence relation for the sub-optimality angle, while in high
SNR regimes we quantify its discrepancy from the cycloid trajectory. The
trajectory-based analysis reveals the order of convergence: linear when the EM
estimate is nearly orthogonal to the ground truth, and quadratic when the angle
between the estimate and ground truth is small at the population level. Our
analysis establishes non-asymptotic guarantees by sharpening bounds on
statistical errors between finite-sample and population EM updates, relating
EM's statistical accuracy to the sub-optimality angle, and proving convergence
with arbitrary initialization at the finite-sample level. This work provides a
novel trajectory-based framework for analyzing EM in Mixed Linear Regression.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk is crucial for
healthcare institutions. This study addresses the growing prevalence of
diabetes and its strong link to heart disease by proposing an efficient CVD
risk prediction model for diabetic patients using machine learning (ML) and
hybrid deep learning (DL) approaches. The BRFSS dataset was preprocessed by
removing duplicates, handling missing values, identifying categorical and
numerical features, and applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature
extraction. Several ML models, including Decision Trees (DT), Random Forest
(RF), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost, and
XGBoost, were implemented, with XGBoost achieving the highest accuracy of
0.9050. Various DL models, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Deep
Neural Networks (DNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), as well as hybrid models combining CNN with LSTM,
BiLSTM, and GRU, were also explored. Some of these models achieved perfect

Motivation: 当前基于扩散模型的时间序列生成方法速度慢且仅限于固定长度窗口，需要更高效灵活的生成方案

Method: 将时间序列分解为数据自适应基和时序系数，将系数向量量化成离散标记，使用LLaMA风格的自回归Transformer建模标记序列

Result: FAR-TS比Diffusion-TS快几个数量级，同时保持通道间相关性和可解释的潜在空间

Conclusion: 该框架实现了高质量、灵活的时间序列合成，具有快速生成和可控性优势

Abstract: Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.

Method: 利用不完全U统计量降低计算复杂度，并通过低秩核近似扩展到非线性分类，实现再生核希尔伯特空间中的高效训练

Result: 理论分析建立了误差界限，实证结果表明在合成和真实数据集上，该方法在保持AUC性能的同时大幅减少了训练时间

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了ROC-SVM的计算瓶颈问题，为类别不平衡场景下的高效AUC最大化分类提供了可行方案

Abstract: The ROC-SVM, originally proposed by Rakotomamonjy, directly maximizes the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) and has become an attractive alternative of the
conventional binary classification under the presence of class imbalance.
However, its practical use is limited by high computational cost, as training
involves evaluating all $O(n^2)$. To overcome this limitation, we develop a
scalable variant of the ROC-SVM that leverages incomplete U-statistics, thereby
substantially reducing computational complexity. We further extend the
framework to nonlinear classification through a low-rank kernel approximation,
enabling efficient training in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Theoretical
analysis establishes an error bound that justifies the proposed approximation,
and empirical results on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves comparable AUC performance to the original ROC-SVM
with drastically reduced training time.

Abstract: The financial industry faces a significant challenge modeling and risk
portfolios: balancing the predictability of advanced machine learning models,
neural network models, and explainability required by regulatory entities (such
as Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau). This paper intends to fill the gap in the application between these
"black box" models and explainability frameworks, such as LIME and SHAP.
Authors elaborate on the application of these frameworks on different models
and demonstrates the more complex models with better prediction powers could be
applied and reach the same level of the explainability, using SHAP and LIME.
Beyond the comparison and discussion of performances, this paper proposes a

Method: 基于优化理论和特征学习研究深度扩展，提出零/一层渐进训练策略，重点关注新层初始化、超参数迁移、学习率调度和模型扩展时机。

Conclusion: 渐进训练是实现计算效率与性能最优权衡的有效策略，为大规模模型训练提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Model depth is a double-edged sword in deep learning: deeper models achieve
higher accuracy but require higher computational cost. To efficiently train
models at scale, an effective strategy is the progressive training, which
scales up model capacity during training, hence significantly reducing
computation with little to none performance degradation. In this work, we study
the depth expansion of large models through the lens of optimization theory and
feature learning, offering insights on the initialization of new layers,
hyperparameter transfer, learning rate schedule, and timing of model expansion.
Specifically, we propose zero/one-layer progressive training for the optimal
tradeoff between computation and loss. For example, zero/one-layer progressive
training on GPT2 can save $\approx 80\%$ compute, or equivalently accelerate
$\approx 5\times$ while achieving almost the same loss, compared to to a fully
trained 60-layer model with 7B parameters.

hit and lead compounds. However, most AI-driven approaches neglect the
importance of endogenous protein interactions with peptides, which may result
in suboptimal molecule designs. In this work, we present Peptide2Mol, an
E(3)-equivariant graph neural network diffusion model that generates small
molecules by referencing both the original peptide binders and their
surrounding protein pocket environments. Trained on large datasets and
leveraging sophisticated modeling techniques, Peptide2Mol not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in non-autoregressive generative tasks, but also
produces molecules with similarity to the original peptide binder.
Additionally, the model allows for molecule optimization and peptidomimetic
design through a partial diffusion process. Our results highlight Peptide2Mol
as an effective deep generative model for generating and optimizing bioactive
small molecules from protein binding pockets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种综合混合框架，集成结构断点检测、小波信号去噪和深度学习模型，显著提高了碳价格预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测碳价格对能源市场决策至关重要，但现有方法在处理结构断点和噪声方面存在不足，缺乏系统评估。

Method: 使用Bai-Perron、ICSS和PELT算法进行结构断点检测，结合小波去噪和LSTM、GRU、TCN三种深度学习模型，构建单变量和多变量数据集进行对比评估。

Result: PELT-WT-TCN模型表现最佳，相比最先进基线模型将预测误差降低22.35%（RMSE）和18.63%（MAE），相比未分解的LSTM模型降低70.55%（RMSE）和74.42%（MAE）。

Conclusion: 将结构意识多尺度分解集成到深度学习架构中，能显著提升碳价格预测的准确性和可解释性。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.

TL;DR: 提出BiPETE模型用于电子健康记录中的疾病风险预测，通过双位置编码策略处理不规则访问间隔，在抑郁症和PTSD队列中显著提升预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于Transformer的疾病风险预测模型中时间依赖关系建模的挑战，特别是处理不规则访问间隔和缺乏统一结构的问题。

Method: BiPETE模型整合旋转位置嵌入编码相对访问时间，使用正弦嵌入保持访问顺序，在两个心理健康队列上训练预测酒精和物质使用障碍风险。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个实用且可解释的疾病风险预测框架，通过归因方法识别关键临床特征，有助于风险评估过程的理解和风险缓解。

Abstract: Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk
prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal
dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack
of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder
or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional
embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to
preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is
trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and
substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving
the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the
depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms
the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the
Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key
clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal
inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific
medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified
by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk
assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In
summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease
risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance.

*Dongjin Park,Hasung Yeo,Joon-Woo Lee*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OvA-LP是一个针对联邦微调中客户端数据分布不均问题的框架，通过线性探测和两阶段训练方法，在源头上抑制局部漂移，在极端非IID条件下保持95.9%的IID性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦微调在异构客户端数据分布下容易受到局部漂移的影响，现有方法主要在事后修正漂移，在极端非IID条件下表现脆弱。

Method: OvA-LP结合冻结编码器的线性探测和一对多分类头，采用两阶段训练程序，保留预训练特征几何结构并解耦逻辑输出以防止漂移放大机制。

Result: 在CIFAR-100的100个客户端上，OvA-LP在shard-1、shard-2和Bernoulli-Dirichlet分区下平均保持95.9%的IID准确率，而现有最佳方法仅保持10.1%（PFPT）和34.5%（FFT-MoE）。

Conclusion: OvA-LP为异构环境下的鲁棒联邦微调提供了原则性和高效的基础，同时在对称和非对称标签噪声下保持弹性，且编码器特征预计算使每轮成本几乎与编码器大小无关。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning (FFT) adapts foundation models to decentralized data
but remains fragile under heterogeneous client distributions due to local
drift, i.e., client-level update divergences that induce systematic bias and
amplified variance in the global model. Existing aggregation and
personalization methods largely correct drift post hoc, which proves brittle
under extreme non-IID conditions. We introduce OvA-LP, a minimalist framework
that is, to our knowledge, the first explicitly designed to suppress drift at
its source within the PEFT-based FFT paradigm. OvA-LP combines linear probing
on a frozen encoder with a one-vs-all head and a simple two-stage procedure,
preserving pretrained feature geometry and decoupling logits to prevent the
mechanisms that amplify drift. On CIFAR-100 with 100 clients, averaged over
shard-1, shard-2, and Bernoulli-Dirichlet partitions, OvA-LP retains 95.9% of
its IID accuracy, whereas state-of-the-art FFT baselines retain only 10.1%
(PFPT) and 34.5% (FFT-MoE) under the same conditions. OvA-LP further maintains
resilience under both symmetric and asymmetric label noise. In addition,
precomputing encoder features makes per-round cost nearly independent of
encoder size. Together, these results demonstrate that OvA-LP provides a
principled and efficient basis for robust FFT under heterogeneity.

Abstract: Text offers intuitive access to information. This can, in particular,
complement the density of numerical time series, thereby allowing improved
interactions with time series models to enhance accessibility and
decision-making. While the creation of question-answering datasets and models
has recently seen remarkable growth, most research focuses on question
answering (QA) on vision and text, with time series receiving minute attention.
To bridge this gap, we propose a challenging novel time series QA (TSQA)
dataset, QuAnTS, for Question Answering on Time Series data. Specifically, we
pose a wide variety of questions and answers about human motion in the form of
tracked skeleton trajectories. We verify that the large-scale QuAnTS dataset is
well-formed and comprehensive through extensive experiments. Thoroughly
evaluating existing and newly proposed baselines then lays the groundwork for a
deeper exploration of TSQA using QuAnTS. Additionally, we provide human
performances as a key reference for gauging the practical usability of such
models. We hope to encourage future research on interacting with time series
models through text, enabling better decision-making and more transparent
systems.

Motivation: 神经网络损失函数与输出层之间存在紧密的统计联系，需要系统分析激活函数和损失函数的数学基础及其统计合理性。

Method: 通过最大似然估计原理，将常见损失函数与广义线性模型联系起来，分析不同激活函数对应的概率分布假设。

Result: 证明了选择特定损失函数等价于假设特定的输出概率分布，为损失函数选择提供了统计理论基础。

Conclusion: 损失函数的选择具有深刻的统计意义，应基于输出层特性和任务需求进行合理选择，报告为实践中的输出编码、约束输出和重尾分布等场景提供了指导。

Abstract: The loss function used to train a neural network is strongly connected to its
output layer from a statistical point of view. This technical report analyzes
common activation functions for a neural network output layer, like linear,
sigmoid, ReLU, and softmax, detailing their mathematical properties and their
appropriate use cases. A strong statistical justification exists for the
selection of the suitable loss function for training a deep learning model.
This report connects common loss functions such as Mean Squared Error (MSE),
Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and various Cross-Entropy losses to the statistical
principle of Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Choosing a specific loss
function is equivalent to assuming a specific probability distribution for the
model output, highlighting the link between these functions and the Generalized
Linear Models (GLMs) that underlie network output layers. Additional scenarios
of practical interest are also considered, such as alternative output
encodings, constrained outputs, and distributions with heavy tails.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的偏好优化方法忽略了生成候选解的生产成本，且未考虑人类专家在提供比较反馈时的感知模糊性。

Method: 通过约束比较仅涉及先前生成的候选解来降低生产成本，并引入Just-Noticeable Difference阈值到概率偏好模型中捕获对小效用差异的漠不关心。采用信息论获取策略选择对未知最优解最具信息量的新配置。

Result: 实验证明在高生产成本或存在漠不关心反馈的设置中，准确性显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了偏好优化中的生产成本和感知模糊性问题，在高成本场景下表现优越。

Abstract: Preferential Bayesian optimization allows optimization of objectives that are
either expensive or difficult to measure directly, by relying on a minimal
number of comparative evaluations done by a human expert. Generating candidate
solutions for evaluation is also often expensive, but this cost is ignored by
existing methods. We generalize preference-based optimization to explicitly
account for production and evaluation costs with Consecutive Preferential
Bayesian Optimization, reducing production cost by constraining comparisons to
involve previously generated candidates. We also account for the perceptual
ambiguity of the oracle providing the feedback by incorporating a
Just-Noticeable Difference threshold into a probabilistic preference model to
capture indifference to small utility differences. We adapt an
information-theoretic acquisition strategy to this setting, selecting new
configurations that are most informative about the unknown optimum under a
preference model accounting for the perceptual ambiguity. We empirically
demonstrate a notable increase in accuracy in setups with high production costs
or with indifference feedback.

TL;DR: 本研究评估了实验室、影像和多模态深度学习模型在PRRT治疗患者中预测无进展生存期(PFS)的效果，发现多模态融合模型表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PRRT是转移性神经内分泌肿瘤的成熟治疗方法，但仅有部分患者能实现长期疾病控制。预测PFS有助于个体化治疗规划。

Method: 回顾性单中心研究纳入116例接受177Lu-DOTATOC治疗的转移性NET患者，收集临床特征、实验室值和治疗前SR-PET/CT数据。训练了7个模型，包括单模态(实验室、SR-PET或CT)和多模态融合方法。

Result: 多模态融合模型(实验室值、SR-PET和CT，增强预训练CT分支)取得最佳结果(AUROC 0.72±0.01，AUPRC 0.80±0.01)，优于单模态方法。

Conclusion: 结合SR-PET、CT和实验室生物标志物的多模态深度学习在PRRT后PFS预测中优于单模态方法，经外部验证后可能支持风险适应性随访策略。

Abstract: Peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) is an established treatment for
metastatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), yet long-term disease control occurs
only in a subset of patients. Predicting progression-free survival (PFS) could
support individualized treatment planning. This study evaluates laboratory,
imaging, and multimodal deep learning models for PFS prediction in PRRT-treated
patients. In this retrospective, single-center study 116 patients with
metastatic NETs undergoing 177Lu-DOTATOC were included. Clinical
characteristics, laboratory values, and pretherapeutic somatostatin receptor
positron emission tomography/computed tomographies (SR-PET/CT) were collected.
Seven models were trained to classify low- vs. high-PFS groups, including
unimodal (laboratory, SR-PET, or CT) and multimodal fusion approaches.
Explainability was evaluated by feature importance analysis and gradient maps.
Forty-two patients (36%) had short PFS (< 1 year), 74 patients long PFS (>1
year). Groups were similar in most characteristics, except for higher baseline
chromogranin A (p = 0.003), elevated gamma-GT (p = 0.002), and fewer PRRT
cycles (p < 0.001) in short-PFS patients. The Random Forest model trained only
on laboratory biomarkers reached an AUROC of 0.59 +- 0.02. Unimodal
three-dimensional convolutional neural networks using SR-PET or CT performed
worse (AUROC 0.42 +- 0.03 and 0.54 +- 0.01, respectively). A multimodal fusion
model laboratory values, SR-PET, and CT -augmented with a pretrained CT branch
- achieved the best results (AUROC 0.72 +- 0.01, AUPRC 0.80 +- 0.01).
Multimodal deep learning combining SR-PET, CT, and laboratory biomarkers
outperformed unimodal approaches for PFS prediction after PRRT. Upon external
validation, such models may support risk-adapted follow-up strategies.

Motivation: NatureLM在生物声学领域表现出色，但专业领域的微调导致了指令跟随灵活性的下降，特别是在同时请求多个信息时准确率显著降低。

Method: 采用简单的模型融合策略，将NatureLM与其基础语言模型进行插值，在保持领域专业知识的同时恢复指令跟随能力。

Result: 融合后的模型在零样本分类未见过物种方面实现了超过200%的相对提升，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 模型融合策略有效解决了专业领域微调与通用能力之间的权衡问题，为生物声学基础模型的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Foundation models capable of generalizing across species and tasks represent
a promising new frontier in bioacoustics, with NatureLM being one of the most
prominent examples. While its domain-specific fine-tuning yields strong
performance on bioacoustic benchmarks, we observe that it also introduces
trade-offs in instruction-following flexibility. For instance, NatureLM
achieves high accuracy when prompted for either the common or scientific name
individually, but its accuracy drops significantly when both are requested in a
single prompt. We address this by applying a simple model merging strategy that
interpolates NatureLM with its base language model, recovering
instruction-following capabilities with minimal loss of domain expertise.
Finally, we show that the merged model exhibits markedly stronger zero-shot
generalization, achieving over a 200% relative improvement and setting a new
state-of-the-art in closed-set zero-shot classification of unseen species.

Conclusion: 生成系统在图像合成、合成数据集生成和自然语言处理等领域容易受到微妙、隐蔽的操纵，威胁其统计完整性。作者检查了现有防御策略的局限性，并提出了一种新的对抗策略。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of generative models such as Stable Diffusion and
ChatGPT has made them increasingly attractive targets for malicious
exploitation, particularly through data poisoning. Existing poisoning attacks
compromising synthesised data typically either cause broad degradation of
generated data or require control over the training process, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel data
poisoning technique called associative poisoning, which compromises
fine-grained features of the generated data without requiring control of the
training process. This attack perturbs only the training data to manipulate
statistical associations between specific feature pairs in the generated
outputs. We provide a formal mathematical formulation of the attack and prove
its theoretical feasibility and stealthiness. Empirical evaluations using two
state-of-the-art generative models demonstrate that associative poisoning
effectively induces or suppresses feature associations while preserving the
marginal distributions of the targeted features and maintaining high-quality
outputs, thereby evading visual detection. These results suggest that
generative systems used in image synthesis, synthetic dataset generation, and
natural language processing are susceptible to subtle, stealthy manipulations
that compromise their statistical integrity. To address this risk, we examine
the limitations of existing defensive strategies and propose a novel
countermeasure strategy.

Abstract: Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All

Abstract: We propose a new way of training neural networks, with the goal of reducing

for the gradient inspired by the theory of the Neural Tangent Kernel. We
empirically show the efficacy of the technique on a vision transformer

Method: 开发了包含稳健预处理和自动睡眠-觉醒检测的管道，提取生理可解释的运动特征，在78人队列上使用嵌套交叉验证开发模型。

Result: 模型在内部测试集（AUROC=0.86）和两个独立外部队列（AUROC=0.84和0.94）上表现良好，跨数据集交叉验证显示稳定性能（AUROC=0.84-0.89）。

Conclusion: ActiTect作为开源工具，促进了广泛采用和独立验证，推动了使用可穿戴设备的统一且可泛化的RBD检测模型发展。

Abstract: Isolated rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (iRBD) is a major
prodromal marker of $\alpha$-synucleinopathies, often preceding the clinical
onset of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or multiple system
atrophy. While wrist-worn actimeters hold significant potential for detecting
RBD in large-scale screening efforts by capturing abnormal nocturnal movements,
they become inoperable without a reliable and efficient analysis pipeline. This
study presents ActiTect, a fully automated, open-source machine learning tool
to identify RBD from actigraphy recordings. To ensure generalizability across
heterogeneous acquisition settings, our pipeline includes robust preprocessing
and automated sleep-wake detection to harmonize multi-device data and extract
physiologically interpretable motion features characterizing activity patterns.
Model development was conducted on a cohort of 78 individuals, yielding strong
discrimination under nested cross-validation (AUROC = 0.95). Generalization was
confirmed on a blinded local test set (n = 31, AUROC = 0.86) and on two
independent external cohorts (n = 113, AUROC = 0.84; n = 57, AUROC = 0.94). To
assess real-world robustness, leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation across the
internal and external cohorts demonstrated consistent performance (AUROC range
= 0.84-0.89). A complementary stability analysis showed that key predictive
features remained reproducible across datasets, supporting the final pooled
multi-center model as a robust pre-trained resource for broader deployment. By
being open-source and easy to use, our tool promotes widespread adoption and
facilitates independent validation and collaborative improvements, thereby
advancing the field toward a unified and generalizable RBD detection model
using wearable devices.

Abstract: Judea Pearl's vision of Structural Causal Models (SCMs) as engines for
counterfactual reasoning hinges on faithful abduction: the precise inference of
latent exogenous noise. For decades, operationalizing this step for complex,
non-linear mechanisms has remained a significant computational challenge. The
advent of diffusion models, powerful universal function approximators, offers a
promising solution. However, we argue that their standard design, optimized for
perceptual generation over logical inference, introduces a fundamental flaw for
this classical problem: an inherent information loss we term the Structural
Reconstruction Error (SRE). To address this challenge, we formalize the
principle of Causal Information Conservation (CIC) as the necessary condition
for faithful abduction. We then introduce BELM-MDCM, the first diffusion-based
framework engineered to be causally sound by eliminating SRE by construction
through an analytically invertible mechanism. To operationalize this framework,
a Targeted Modeling strategy provides structural regularization, while a Hybrid
Training Objective instills a strong causal inductive bias. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our Zero-SRE framework not only achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but, more importantly, enables the high-fidelity,
individual-level counterfactuals required for deep causal inquiries. Our work
provides a foundational blueprint that reconciles the power of modern
generative models with the rigor of classical causal theory, establishing a new
and more rigorous standard for this emerging field.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于分层Actor-Critic深度强化学习的TSP-D求解框架，结合Transformer编码器和最小门控单元解码器，在训练效率和求解质量上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卡车-无人机协同物流系统在最后一公里配送中具有重要应用价值，但TSP-D问题具有NP-hard组合复杂性，传统优化方法难以有效解决，需要新的深度强化学习方法来应对这一挑战。

Method: 采用分层Actor-Critic深度强化学习框架，包含Transformer启发的编码器（集成k近邻稀疏注意力机制）和最小门控单元解码器，在异步优势Actor-Critic范式下运行。

Result: 在N=10到100的基准TSP-D实例上，相比高性能启发式算法和现有强化学习方法，该模型在更短的平均计算时间内获得竞争性甚至更优的解，且训练时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 该框架在训练效率和最终性能方面具有显著优势，为TSP-D问题提供了有效的深度强化学习解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.

Abstract: Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the
safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects.
This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation
for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with
machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$
injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that
uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the
diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve
covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation
(ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability
fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is
applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced
Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains
significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied,
while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical
implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty
quantification for risk assessment.

Motivation: 在电子健康记录的时间序列预测任务中，平衡强隐私保护和高预测性能至关重要。成员推理攻击会泄露训练数据的隐私信息，需要有效防御方法。

Method: 使用三种数据增强策略：Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO)、ZOO-PCA（基于主成分分析的约束变体）和MixUp，通过合成数据重新训练模型来增强模型对成员推理攻击的抵抗能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，ZOO-PCA方法在降低成员推理攻击的TPR/FPR比率方面表现最佳，同时不会牺牲测试数据的预测性能。

Conclusion: 数据增强特别是ZOO-PCA方法能有效减轻时间序列预测模型中的成员推理攻击，在保护隐私的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.

*Jatin Prakash,Aahlad Puli,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CAT（Compress & Attend Transformer）是一种高效Transformer架构，通过压缩和注意力机制在保持质量的同时显著降低计算和内存成本，支持测试时自适应调整质量-计算权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效Transformer方法（如稀疏注意力、滑动窗口等）往往在质量（特别是上下文回忆性能）和计算效率之间做出妥协，且需要复杂的混合架构设计。这些方法无法在测试时灵活调整质量-计算权衡。

Method: CAT使用两个简单组件：密集注意力和压缩。它通过将序列压缩为块来减少序列长度，在解码时对压缩后的块进行注意力计算。支持多块大小训练，实现单一自适应架构。

Result: 在语言建模、上下文回忆和长上下文理解任务中，CAT优于现有高效基线，包括混合架构。与密集Transformer相比，CAT在保持相同语言建模质量的同时，速度提升1.4-3倍，内存使用降低2-9倍。

Conclusion: CAT提供了一种简单而有效的解决方案，能够在单一自适应架构中实现质量-计算权衡的灵活控制，无需重新训练即可在测试时调整性能。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention in transformers motivated the development of
efficient approaches: namely sparse and sliding window attention, convolutions
and linear attention. Although these approaches result in impressive reductions
in compute and memory, they often trade-off with quality, specifically
in-context recall performance. Moreover, apriori fixing this quality-compute
tradeoff means being suboptimal from the get-go: some downstream applications
require more memory for in-context recall, while others require lower latency
and memory. Further, these approaches rely on heuristic choices that
artificially restrict attention, or require handcrafted and complex recurrent
state update rules, or they must be carefully composed with attention at
specific layers to form a hybrid architecture that complicates the design
process, especially at scale. To address above issues, we propose Compress &
Attend Transformer (CAT), a conceptually simple architecture employing two
simple ingredients only: dense attention and compression. CAT decodes chunks of
tokens by attending to compressed chunks of the sequence so far. Compression
results in decoding from a reduced sequence length that yields compute and
memory savings, while choosing a particular chunk size trades-off quality for
efficiency. Moreover, CAT can be trained with multiple chunk sizes at once,
unlocking control of quality-compute trade-offs directly at test-time without
any retraining, all in a single adaptive architecture. In exhaustive
evaluations on common language modeling tasks, in-context recall, and
long-context understanding, a single adaptive CAT model outperforms existing
efficient baselines, including hybrid architectures, across different
compute-memory budgets. Further, a single CAT matches dense transformer in
language modeling across model scales while being 1.4-3x faster and requiring
2-9x lower total memory usage.

*Janet Jenq,Hongda Shen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种新方法，通过在商品图片上渲染相关文本内容来增强视觉-文本对齐，从而提高多模态商品检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态商品检索系统依赖视觉和文本信号的结合，但像CLIP这样的视觉语言模型容易受到排版攻击的影响，即图像中嵌入的误导性或无关文本会扭曲模型预测。

Method: 提出一种新方法，通过将相关文本内容（如标题、描述）直接渲染到商品图片上，进行视觉-文本压缩，从而加强图像-文本对齐。

Result: 在三个垂直领域的电商数据集（运动鞋、手提包和交易卡）上使用六种最先进的视觉基础模型进行评估，实验显示在单模态和多模态检索准确性方面均取得一致改进。

Conclusion: 视觉渲染商品元数据是一种简单而有效的增强方法，可用于电商应用中的零样本多模态检索。

Abstract: Multimodal product retrieval systems in e-commerce platforms rely on
effectively combining visual and textual signals to improve search relevance
and user experience. However, vision-language models such as CLIP are
vulnerable to typographic attacks, where misleading or irrelevant text embedded
in images skews model predictions. In this work, we propose a novel method that
reverses the logic of typographic attacks by rendering relevant textual content
(e.g., titles, descriptions) directly onto product images to perform
vision-text compression, thereby strengthening image-text alignment and
boosting multimodal product retrieval performance. We evaluate our method on
three vertical-specific e-commerce datasets (sneakers, handbags, and trading
cards) using six state-of-the-art vision foundation models. Our experiments
demonstrate consistent improvements in unimodal and multimodal retrieval
accuracy across categories and model families. Our findings suggest that
visually rendering product metadata is a simple yet effective enhancement for
zero-shot multimodal retrieval in e-commerce applications.

Result: 在非线性仿真案例中验证了方法有效性，并与依赖动量测量的最先进方法进行了比较。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从有限的输入-输出数据学习物理一致的模型，适用于模型预测控制等应用场景。

Abstract: Embedding non-restrictive prior knowledge, such as energy conservation laws,
in learning-based approaches is a key motive to construct physically consistent
models from limited data, relevant for, e.g., model-based control. Recent work
incorporates Hamiltonian dynamics into Gaussian Process (GP) regression to
obtain uncertainty-quantifying models that adhere to the underlying physical
principles. However, these works rely on velocity or momentum data, which is
rarely available in practice. In this paper, we consider dynamics learning with
non-conservative Hamiltonian GPs, and address the more realistic problem
setting of learning from input-output data. We provide a fully Bayesian scheme
for estimating probability densities of unknown hidden states, of GP
hyperparameters, as well as of structural hyperparameters, such as damping
coefficients. Considering the computational complexity of GPs, we take
advantage of a reduced-rank GP approximation and leverage its properties for
computationally efficient prediction and training. The proposed method is
evaluated in a nonlinear simulation case study and compared to a
state-of-the-art approach that relies on momentum measurements.

Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map
desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure,
naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse

median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES
evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds.
These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for
advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid

Abstract: As smart grids evolve to meet growing energy demands and modern operational
challenges, the ability to accurately predict faults becomes increasingly
critical. However, existing AI-based fault prediction models struggle to ensure
reliability in evolving environments where they are required to adapt to new
fault types and operational zones. In this paper, we propose a continual
learning (CL) framework in the smart grid context to evolve the model together
with the environment. We design four realistic evaluation scenarios grounded in
class-incremental and domain-incremental learning to emulate evolving grid
conditions. We further introduce Prototype-based Dark Experience Replay
(ProDER), a unified replay-based approach that integrates prototype-based
feature regularization, logit distillation, and a prototype-guided replay
memory. ProDER achieves the best performance among tested CL techniques, with
only a 0.045 accuracy drop for fault type prediction and 0.015 for fault zone
prediction. These results demonstrate the practicality of CL for scalable,
real-world fault prediction in smart grids.

Conclusion: APP方法在保持电路质量的同时大幅降低了计算成本，为小模型的深入电路分析提供了可行方案

Abstract: Circuit discovery is a key step in many mechanistic interpretability
pipelines. Current methods, such as Path Patching, are computationally
expensive and have limited in-depth circuit analysis for smaller models. In
this study, we propose Accelerated Path Patching (APP), a hybrid approach
leveraging our novel contrastive attention head pruning method to drastically
reduce the search space of circuit discovery methods. Our Contrastive-FLAP
pruning algorithm uses techniques from causal mediation analysis to assign
higher pruning scores to task-specific attention heads, leading to higher
performing sparse models compared to traditional pruning techniques. Although
Contrastive-FLAP is successful at preserving task-specific heads that existing
pruning algorithms remove at low sparsity ratios, the circuits found by
Contrastive-FLAP alone are too large to satisfy the minimality constraint
required in circuit analysis. APP first applies Contrastive-FLAP to reduce the
search space on required for circuit discovery algorithms by, on average, 56\%.
Next, APP, applies traditional Path Patching on the remaining attention heads,
leading to a speed up of 59.63\%-93.27\% compared to Path Patching applied to
the dense model. Despite the substantial computational saving that APP
provides, circuits obtained from APP exhibit substantial overlap and similar
performance to previously established Path Patching circuits

Abstract: We study adversarially robust multitask adaptive linear quadratic control; a
setting where multiple systems collaboratively learn control policies under
model uncertainty and adversarial corruption. We propose a clustered multitask
approach that integrates clustering and system identification with resilient
aggregation to mitigate corrupted model updates. Our analysis characterizes how
clustering accuracy, intra-cluster heterogeneity, and adversarial behavior
affect the expected regret of certainty-equivalent (CE) control across LQR
tasks. We establish non-asymptotic bounds demonstrating that the regret
decreases inversely with the number of honest systems per cluster and that this
reduction is preserved under a bounded fraction of adversarial systems within
each cluster.

Conclusion: 该方法使GNS能够用于逆设计和闭环控制任务，其中材料属性可作为设计变量处理。

Abstract: Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.

Conclusion: Synapse框架通过有效仲裁多个TSFMs的互补专长，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能和稳健性。

Abstract: Pre-trained Time Series Foundational Models (TSFMs) represent a significant
advance, capable of forecasting diverse time series with complex
characteristics, including varied seasonalities, trends, and long-range
dependencies. Despite their primary goal of universal time series forecasting,
their efficacy is far from uniform; divergent training protocols and data
sources cause individual TSFMs to exhibit highly variable performance across
different forecasting tasks, domains, and horizons. Leveraging this
complementary expertise by arbitrating existing TSFM outputs presents a
compelling strategy, yet this remains a largely unexplored area of research. In
this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of how different TSFMs exhibit
specialized performance profiles across various forecasting settings, and how
we can effectively leverage this behavior in arbitration between different time
series models. We specifically analyze how factors such as model selection and
forecast horizon distribution can influence the efficacy of arbitration
strategies. Based on this analysis, we propose Synapse, a novel arbitration
framework for TSFMs. Synapse is designed to dynamically leverage a pool of
TSFMs, assign and adjust predictive weights based on their relative,
context-dependent performance, and construct a robust forecast distribution by
adaptively sampling from the output quantiles of constituent models.
Experimental results demonstrate that Synapse consistently outperforms other
popular ensembling techniques as well as individual TSFMs, demonstrating
Synapse's efficacy in time series forecasting.

Method: 通过推导流匹配分布近似的KL散度的确定性非渐近上界，分析L2流匹配损失与KL散度的关系，利用数据场和速度场的正则性确定常数A1和A2。

Result: 当L2流匹配损失有界于ε²时，KL散度上界为A1ε + A2ε²；流匹配在估计平滑分布时达到近乎极小极大最优效率；数值研究验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 流匹配方法在统计效率上与扩散模型相当，为流匹配变换器提供了理论收敛保证，证明了其在分布估计中的有效性。

Abstract: We derive a deterministic, non-asymptotic upper bound on the Kullback-Leibler
(KL) divergence of the flow-matching distribution approximation. In particular,
if the $L_2$ flow-matching loss is bounded by $\epsilon^2 > 0$, then the KL
divergence between the true data distribution and the estimated distribution is
bounded by $A_1 \epsilon + A_2 \epsilon^2$. Here, the constants $A_1$ and $A_2$
depend only on the regularities of the data and velocity fields. Consequently,
this bound implies statistical convergence rates of Flow Matching Transformers
under the Total Variation (TV) distance. We show that, flow matching achieves
nearly minimax-optimal efficiency in estimating smooth distributions. Our
results make the statistical efficiency of flow matching comparable to that of
diffusion models under the TV distance. Numerical studies on synthetic and
learned velocities corroborate our theory.

*Antônio Catão,Melvin Poveda,Leonardo Voltarelli,Paulo Orenstein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TUPANN是一种基于卫星数据的降水临近预报模型，通过物理对齐的深度学习架构，将预报分解为运动场和强度场等物理可解释组件，在多个气候区域表现出优于传统方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统降水预报依赖密集的雷达网络，在气候极端地区受限。作者希望开发仅使用卫星数据的通用预报模型，解决雷达覆盖不足的问题。

Method: TUPANN采用物理对齐的三组件架构：变分编码器-解码器推断运动场和强度场，条件化MaxViT演化潜状态，可微分平流算子重建未来帧。模型在GOES-16 RRQPE数据上训练。

Result: 在4个不同气候区域的评估显示，TUPANN在大多数设置下达到最佳或次佳性能，特别是在高降水阈值下优势明显。多城市训练进一步提升性能，跨城市迁移仅出现适度性能下降。

Conclusion: 物理对齐学习能够提供技能性强、可迁移且全球适用的临近预报，模型运行接近实时，运动场平滑可解释。

Abstract: Accurate short-term precipitation forecasts predominantly rely on dense
weather-radar networks, limiting operational value in places most exposed to
climate extremes. We present TUPANN (Transferable and Universal Physics-Aligned
Nowcasting Network), a satellite-only model trained on GOES-16 RRQPE. Unlike
most deep learning models for nowcasting, TUPANN decomposes the forecast into
physically meaningful components: a variational encoder-decoder infers motion
and intensity fields from recent imagery under optical-flow supervision, a
lead-time-conditioned MaxViT evolves the latent state, and a differentiable
advection operator reconstructs future frames. We evaluate TUPANN on both
GOES-16 and IMERG data, in up to four distinct climates (Rio de Janeiro,
Manaus, Miami, La Paz) at 10-180min lead times using the CSI and HSS metrics
over 4-64 mm/h thresholds. Comparisons against optical-flow, deep learning and
hybrid baselines show that TUPANN achieves the best or second-best skill in
most settings, with pronounced gains at higher thresholds. Training on multiple
cities further improves performance, while cross-city experiments show modest
degradation and occasional gains for rare heavy-rain regimes. The model
produces smooth, interpretable motion fields aligned with numerical optical
flow and runs in near real time due to the low latency of GOES-16. These
results indicate that physically aligned learning can provide nowcasts that are
skillful, transferable and global.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SoilX是一个无需校准的土壤传感系统，可同时测量土壤水分、氮磷钾养分以及有机碳和铝硅酸盐，通过对比性跨组分学习和新型天线设计解决土壤质地变化导致的校准问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准农业需要连续准确监测土壤水分和养分，但现有无线土壤传感方案需要根据土壤质地变化重新校准，限制了实用性。

Method: 采用对比性跨组分学习(3CL)和正交正则化器、分离损失函数来解耦组分间干扰，设计四面体天线阵列和天线切换机制来稳定测量介电常数。

Result: 实验表明SoilX比基线方法减少23.8%-31.5%的估计误差，并能很好地泛化到未见过的田地。

Conclusion: SoilX通过联合测量六个关键组分和先进的信号处理技术，实现了无需重新校准的准确土壤监测，为精准农业提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Precision agriculture demands continuous and accurate monitoring of soil
moisture (M) and key macronutrients, including nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
and potassium (K), to optimize yields and conserve resources. Wireless soil
sensing has been explored to measure these four components; however, current
solutions require recalibration (i.e., retraining the data processing model) to
handle variations in soil texture, characterized by aluminosilicates (Al) and
organic carbon (C), limiting their practicality. To address this, we introduce
SoilX, a calibration-free soil sensing system that jointly measures six key
components: {M, N, P, K, C, Al}. By explicitly modeling C and Al, SoilX
eliminates texture- and carbon-dependent recalibration. SoilX incorporates
Contrastive Cross-Component Learning (3CL), with two customized terms: the
Orthogonality Regularizer and the Separation Loss, to effectively disentangle
cross-component interference. Additionally, we design a novel tetrahedral
antenna array with an antenna-switching mechanism, which can robustly measure
soil dielectric permittivity independent of device placement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that SoilX reduces estimation errors by 23.8% to 31.5%
over baselines and generalizes well to unseen fields.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法往往独立处理序列和结构信息，未能捕捉局部结构几何与全局序列模式之间的复杂耦合关系。

Method: 提出DGTN（扩散图-Transformer网络），采用双向扩散过程：GNN结构嵌入通过可学习扩散核指导Transformer注意力，Transformer表示通过注意力调制的图更新精炼GNN消息传递。

Result: 在ProTherm和SKEMPI基准测试中，DGTN达到最先进性能（Pearson Rho = 0.87，RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol），比最佳基线提升6.2%。扩散机制贡献4.8个相关点。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过可学习扩散建立了整合异构蛋白质表示的原则性框架，理论分析证明扩散注意力收敛到最优结构-序列耦合。

Abstract: Predicting the effect of amino acid mutations on enzyme thermodynamic
stability (DDG) is fundamental to protein engineering and drug design. While
recent deep learning approaches have shown promise, they often process sequence
and structure information independently, failing to capture the intricate
coupling between local structural geometry and global sequential patterns. We
present DGTN (Diffused Graph-Transformer Network), a novel architecture that
co-learns graph neural network (GNN) weights for structural priors and
transformer attention through a diffusion mechanism. Our key innovation is a
bidirectional diffusion process where: (1) GNN-derived structural embeddings
guide transformer attention via learnable diffusion kernels, and (2)
transformer representations refine GNN message passing through
attention-modulated graph updates. We provide rigorous mathematical analysis
showing this co-learning scheme achieves provably better approximation bounds
than independent processing. On ProTherm and SKEMPI benchmarks, DGTN achieves
state-of-the-art performance (Pearson Rho = 0.87, RMSE = 1.21 kcal/mol), with
6.2% improvement over best baselines. Ablation studies confirm the diffusion
mechanism contributes 4.8 points to correlation. Our theoretical analysis
proves the diffused attention converges to optimal structure-sequence coupling,
with convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) ) where T is diffusion steps. This work
establishes a principled framework for integrating heterogeneous protein
representations through learnable diffusion.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ScheduleStream是首个通用框架，用于通过采样操作进行规划与调度，解决多臂机器人同时运动的时序规划问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 双足和人形机器人具有利用多臂高效完成任务的能力，但多臂同时控制由于混合离散-连续动作空间的增长而具有计算挑战性。现有的TAMP算法通常只能规划单臂顺序运动而非并行运动

Method: 提出ScheduleStream框架，使用混合持续时间动作建模时序动态，这些动作可以异步启动且持续时间是其参数的函数。开发了领域无关算法，并在TAMPAS中应用GPU加速采样器

Result: 与多个消融实验相比，ScheduleStream算法能产生更高效的解决方案，并在多个真实世界双足机器人任务中进行了验证

Conclusion: ScheduleStream成功扩展了TAMP以生成并行运动调度，为多臂机器人控制提供了有效的规划与调度解决方案

Abstract: Bimanual and humanoid robots are appealing because of their human-like
ability to leverage multiple arms to efficiently complete tasks. However,
controlling multiple arms at once is computationally challenging due to the
growth in the hybrid discrete-continuous action space. Task and Motion Planning
(TAMP) algorithms can efficiently plan in hybrid spaces but generally produce
plans, where only one arm is moving at a time, rather than schedules that allow
for parallel arm motion. In order to extend TAMP to produce schedules, we
present ScheduleStream, the first general-purpose framework for planning &
scheduling with sampling operations. ScheduleStream models temporal dynamics
using hybrid durative actions, which can be started asynchronously and persist
for a duration that's a function of their parameters. We propose
domain-independent algorithms that solve ScheduleStream problems without any
application-specific mechanisms. We apply ScheduleStream to Task and Motion
Planning & Scheduling (TAMPAS), where we use GPU acceleration within samplers
to expedite planning. We compare ScheduleStream algorithms to several ablations
in simulation and find that they produce more efficient solutions. We
demonstrate ScheduleStream on several real-world bimanual robot tasks at

Motivation: 现有的仿真构建过程劳动密集，限制了机器人学习的扩展和策略验证。需要自动化方法来生成更复杂、多样化的仿真环境。

Method: 基于大语言模型构建有向图表示因果关系和相关实体，将其转换为符号程序来配置和执行机器人仿真环境。支持反事实场景生成和多种感知模态推理。

Conclusion: ReGen框架通过自动化仿真设计增强了机器人策略验证能力，支持数据和仿真增强，推动了可扩展的机器人学习，提高了泛化性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Simulation plays a key role in scaling robot learning and validating
policies, but constructing simulations remains a labor-intensive process. This
paper introduces ReGen, a generative simulation framework that automates
simulation design via inverse design. Given a robot's behavior -- such as a
motion trajectory or an objective function -- and its textual description,
ReGen infers plausible scenarios and environments that could have caused the
behavior. ReGen leverages large language models to synthesize scenarios by
expanding a directed graph that encodes cause-and-effect relationships,
relevant entities, and their properties. This structured graph is then
translated into a symbolic program, which configures and executes a robot
simulation environment. Our framework supports (i) augmenting simulations based
on ego-agent behaviors, (ii) controllable, counterfactual scenario generation,
(iii) reasoning about agent cognition and mental states, and (iv) reasoning
with distinct sensing modalities, such as braking due to faulty GPS signals. We
demonstrate ReGen in autonomous driving and robot manipulation tasks,
generating more diverse, complex simulated environments compared to existing
simulations with high success rates, and enabling controllable generation for
corner cases. This approach enhances the validation of robot policies and
supports data or simulation augmentation, advancing scalable robot learning for
improved generalization and robustness. We provide code and example videos at:

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出Multimodal Diffusion Forcing（MDF）框架，通过扩散模型学习多模态机器人轨迹中的时间依赖性和跨模态关系，实现超越动作生成的多样化功能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模仿学习方法仅学习从观察到动作的直接映射，忽略了感官输入、动作和奖励等多模态之间的丰富交互关系，而这些关系对于建模机器人行为和理解任务结果至关重要。

Method: 使用随机部分掩码训练扩散模型来重构轨迹，鼓励模型学习时间和跨模态依赖关系，如预测动作对力信号的影响或从部分观察推断状态。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界的接触式强力操作任务中，MDF不仅提供多样化功能，还表现出强大的性能和抗噪声鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MDF框架能够有效学习多模态轨迹中的复杂依赖关系，为机器人行为建模提供了更全面的解决方案。

Abstract: Given a dataset of expert trajectories, standard imitation learning
approaches typically learn a direct mapping from observations (e.g., RGB
images) to actions. However, such methods often overlook the rich interplay
between different modalities, i.e., sensory inputs, actions, and rewards, which
is crucial for modeling robot behavior and understanding task outcomes. In this
work, we propose Multimodal Diffusion Forcing, a unified framework for learning
from multimodal robot trajectories that extends beyond action generation.
Rather than modeling a fixed distribution, MDF applies random partial masking
and trains a diffusion model to reconstruct the trajectory. This training
objective encourages the model to learn temporal and cross-modal dependencies,
such as predicting the effects of actions on force signals or inferring states
from partial observations. We evaluate MDF on contact-rich, forceful
manipulation tasks in simulated and real-world environments. Our results show
that MDF not only delivers versatile functionalities, but also achieves strong
performance, and robustness under noisy observations. More visualizations can

Motivation: 

Method: 

Result: 

Conclusion: 

Abstract: The reproducibility crisis in scientific computing constrains robotics
research. Existing studies reveal that up to 70% of robotics algorithms cannot
be reproduced by independent teams, while many others fail to reach deployment
because creating shareable software environments remains prohibitively complex.
These challenges stem from fragmented, multi-language, and hardware-software
toolchains that lead to dependency hell. We present Pixi, a unified
package-management framework that addresses these issues by capturing exact
dependency states in project-level lockfiles, ensuring bit-for-bit
reproducibility across platforms. Its high-performance SAT solver achieves up
to 10x faster dependency resolution than comparable tools, while integration of
the conda-forge and PyPI ecosystems removes the need for multiple managers.
Adopted in over 5,300 projects since 2023, Pixi reduces setup times from hours
to minutes and lowers technical barriers for researchers worldwide. By enabling
scalable, reproducible, collaborative research infrastructure, Pixi accelerates
progress in robotics and AI.

Method: 使用启发式路径预测器生成初始路径，应用共形预测量化预测器的不确定性，构建具有概率保证的认证采样区域，并将其集成到现有SBMP中实现非均匀采样。

Result: 实验表明该方法能更快找到可行路径，且在未见环境中具有更好的泛化性能，优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个为SBMP提供概率正确保证的非均匀采样方法，显著提高了运动规划的效率和可靠性。

Abstract: Sampling-based motion planners (SBMPs) are widely used to compute dynamically
feasible robot paths. However, their reliance on uniform sampling often leads
to poor efficiency and slow planning in complex environments. We introduce a
novel non-uniform sampling strategy that integrates into existing SBMPs by
biasing sampling toward `certified' regions. These regions are constructed by
(i) generating an initial, possibly infeasible, path using any heuristic path
predictor (e.g., A* or vision-language models) and (ii) applying conformal
prediction to quantify the predictor's uncertainty. This process yields
prediction sets around the initial-guess path that are guaranteed, with
user-specified probability, to contain the optimal solution. To our knowledge,
this is the first non-uniform sampling approach for SBMPs that provides such
probabilistically correct guarantees on the sampling regions. Extensive
evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently finds feasible paths
faster and generalizes better to unseen environments than existing baselines.

Method: 设计了两种清洁机制（刮水器系统和轨道系统）并测试了防护材料，通过碰撞测试评估聚碳酸酯等材料的性能。

Result: 在防护材料方面，聚碳酸酯表现良好，关键因素是在面板表面和硬质材料之间添加软质材料层。在清洁系统比较中，刮水器系统在成本、清洁速度和总功耗方面优于轨道系统。

Conclusion: 刮水器清洁系统比轨道系统更高效，而防护材料的关键在于软硬材料的合理分层设计。

Abstract: Solar energy is used for many mission-critical applications including space
exploration, sensor systems to monitor wildfires, etc. Their operation can be
limited or even terminated if solar panels are covered with dust or hit by
space debris. To address this issue, we designed panel cleaning mechanisms and
tested protective materials. For cleaning mechanisms, we designed and compared
a wiper system and a rail system. For protective materials, we found through
collision tests that polycarbonate was very promising, though the most
important factor was layering a soft material between the panel's surface and a
hard material. In the cleaning system comparisons, the wiper-based system was
more efficient than the rail-based system in terms of cost, cleaning speed, and
total power consumption.

Abstract: We introduce iFlyBot-VLM, a general-purpose Vision-Language Model (VLM) used

Control Parameter Generation; 4) Task Planning and Skill Sequencing. We
envision iFlyBot-VLM as a scalable and generalizable foundation model for
embodied AI, facilitating the progression from specialized task-oriented
systems toward generalist, cognitively capable agents. We conducted evaluations
on 10 current mainstream embodied intelligence-related VLM benchmark datasets,
such as Blink and Where2Place, and achieved optimal performance while
preserving the model's general capabilities. We will publicly release both the

Abstract: Maintaining system stability and accurate position tracking is imperative in
networked robotic systems, particularly for haptics-enabled human-robot
interaction. Recent literature has integrated human biomechanics into the
stabilizers implemented for teleoperation, enhancing force preservation while
guaranteeing convergence and safety. However, position desynchronization due to
imperfect communication and non-passive behaviors remains a challenge. This
paper proposes a two-port biomechanics-aware passivity-based synchronizer and
stabilizer, referred to as TBPS2. This stabilizer optimizes position
synchronization by leveraging human biomechanics while reducing the
stabilizer's conservatism in its activation. We provide the mathematical design
synthesis of the stabilizer and the proof of stability. We also conducted a
series of grid simulations and systematic experiments, comparing their
performance with that of state-of-the-art solutions under varying time delays
and environmental conditions.

Abstract: Diffusion policies have emerged as a powerful framework for robotic
visuomotor control, yet they often lack the robustness to recover from subtask
failures in long-horizon, multi-stage tasks and their learned representations
of observations are often difficult to interpret. In this work, we propose the
Mixture of Experts-Enhanced Diffusion Policy (MoE-DP), where the core idea is
to insert a Mixture of Experts (MoE) layer between the visual encoder and the
diffusion model. This layer decomposes the policy's knowledge into a set of
specialized experts, which are dynamically activated to handle different phases
of a task. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that MoE-DP exhibits a
strong capability to recover from disturbances, significantly outperforming
standard baselines in robustness. On a suite of 6 long-horizon simulation
tasks, this leads to a 36% average relative improvement in success rate under
disturbed conditions. This enhanced robustness is further validated in the real
world, where MoE-DP also shows significant performance gains. We further show
that MoE-DP learns an interpretable skill decomposition, where distinct experts
correspond to semantic task primitives (e.g., approaching, grasping). This
learned structure can be leveraged for inference-time control, allowing for the
rearrangement of subtasks without any re-training.Our video and code are

Abstract: Centralized Multiport Networked Dynamic (CMND) systems have emerged as a key
architecture with applications in several complex network systems, such as
multilateral telerobotics and multi-agent control. These systems consist of a
hub node/subsystem connecting with multiple remote nodes/subsystems via a
networked architecture. One challenge for this system is stability, which can
be affected by non-ideal network artifacts. Conventional passivity-based
approaches can stabilize the system under specialized applications like
small-scale networked systems. However, those conventional passive stabilizers
have several restrictions, such as distributing compensation across subsystems
in a decentralized manner, limiting flexibility, and, at the same time, relying
on the restrictive assumptions of node passivity. This paper synthesizes a
centralized optimal passivity-based stabilization framework for CMND systems.
It consists of a centralized passivity observer monitoring overall energy flow
and an optimal passivity controller that distributes the just-needed
dissipation among various nodes, guaranteeing strict passivity and, thus, L2
stability. The proposed data-driven model-free approach, i.e., Tunable
Centralized Optimal Passivity Control (TCoPC), optimizes total performance
based on the prescribed dissipation distribution strategy while ensuring
stability. The controller can put high dissipation loads on some sub-networks
while relaxing the dissipation on other nodes. Simulation results demonstrate
the proposed frameworks performance in a complex task under different
time-varying delay scenarios while relaxing the remote nodes minimum phase and
passivity assumption, enhancing the scalability and generalizability.

Conclusion: 该方法为增强机器人在复杂现实环境中的操作能力提供了广泛的应用前景

Abstract: Robotic manipulation in complex, constrained spaces is vital for widespread
applications but challenging, particularly when navigating narrow passages with
elongated objects. Existing planning methods often fail in these low-clearance
scenarios due to the sampling difficulties or the local minima. This work
proposes Topology-Aware Planning for Object Manipulation (TAPOM), which
explicitly incorporates task-space topological analysis to enable efficient
planning. TAPOM uses a high-level analysis to identify critical pathways and
generate guiding keyframes, which are utilized in a low-level planner to find
feasible configuration space trajectories. Experimental validation demonstrates
significantly high success rates and improved efficiency over state-of-the-art
methods on low-clearance manipulation tasks. This approach offers broad
implications for enhancing manipulation capabilities of robots in complex
real-world environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DAP的双角色策略，将物体操作任务分为接近阶段和操作阶段，利用不同的视觉先验来增强每个阶段的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体操作方法通常忽略任务的分阶段特性，使用单一策略学习整个操作过程，导致效果不佳。

Method: DAP包含基于功能性的角色来定位功能部件以改进接近过程，基于运动流的角色来捕捉组件运动以促进操作过程，以及一个决策器来确定当前阶段并选择相应角色。

Result: 在自建数据集、RoboTwin基准和真实场景中，DAP方法分别比SOTA方法平均高出5.55%、14.7%和10.4%。

Conclusion: 明确考虑物体操作的不同阶段并利用异质视觉先验可以显著提升性能，特别是在长期多阶段任务中。

Abstract: Object manipulation, which focuses on learning to perform tasks on similar
parts across different types of objects, can be divided into an approaching
stage and a manipulation stage. However, previous works often ignore this
characteristic of the task and rely on a single policy to directly learn the
whole process of object manipulation. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Dual-Actor Policy, termed DAP, which explicitly considers different
stages and leverages heterogeneous visual priors to enhance each stage.
Specifically, we introduce an affordance-based actor to locate the functional
part in the manipulation task, thereby improving the approaching process.
Following this, we propose a motion flow-based actor to capture the movement of
the component, facilitating the manipulation process. Finally, we introduce a
decision maker to determine the current stage of DAP and select the
corresponding actor. Moreover, existing object manipulation datasets contain
few objects and lack the visual priors needed to support training. To address
this, we construct a simulated dataset, the Dual-Prior Object Manipulation
Dataset, which combines the two visual priors and includes seven tasks,
including two challenging long-term, multi-stage tasks. Experimental results on
our dataset, the RoboTwin benchmark and real-world scenarios illustrate that
our method consistently outperforms the SOTA method by 5.55%, 14.7% and 10.4%
on average respectively.

Abstract: Autonomous micro-mobility platforms face challenges from the perspective of
the typical deployment environment: large indoor spaces or urban areas that are
potentially crowded and highly dynamic. While social navigation algorithms have
progressed significantly, optimizing user comfort and overall user experience
over other typical metrics in robotics (e.g., time or distance traveled) is
understudied. Specifically, these metrics are critical in commercial
applications. In this paper, we show how imitation learning delivers smoother
and overall better controllers, versus previously used manually-tuned
controllers. We demonstrate how DAAV's autonomous wheelchair achieves
state-of-the-art comfort in follow-me mode, in which it follows a human
operator assisting persons with reduced mobility (PRM). This paper analyzes
different neural network architectures for end-to-end control and demonstrates
their usability in real-world production-level deployments.

Abstract: The deployment of autonomous systems has experienced remarkable growth in
recent years, driven by their integration into sectors such as industry,
medicine, logistics, and domestic environments. This expansion is accompanied
by a series of security issues that entail significant risks due to the
critical nature of autonomous systems, especially those operating in

Abstract: Robots operating in complex and uncertain environments face considerable
challenges. Advanced robotic systems often rely on extensive datasets to learn
manipulation tasks. In contrast, when humans are faced with unfamiliar tasks,
such as assembling a chair, a common approach is to learn by watching video
demonstrations. In this paper, we propose a novel method for learning robot
policies by Retrieving-from-Video (RfV), using analogies from human
demonstrations to address manipulation tasks. Our system constructs a video
bank comprising recordings of humans performing diverse daily tasks. To enrich
the knowledge from these videos, we extract mid-level information, such as
object affordance masks and hand motion trajectories, which serve as additional
inputs to enhance the robot model's learning and generalization capabilities.
We further feature a dual-component system: a video retriever that taps into an
external video bank to fetch task-relevant video based on task specification,
and a policy generator that integrates this retrieved knowledge into the
learning cycle. This approach enables robots to craft adaptive responses to
various scenarios and generalize to tasks beyond those in the training data.
Through rigorous testing in multiple simulated and real-world settings, our
system demonstrates a marked improvement in performance over conventional
robotic systems, showcasing a significant breakthrough in the field of
robotics.

Abstract: Today's autonomous agents can understand free-form natural language
instructions and execute long-horizon tasks in a manner akin to human-level
reasoning. These capabilities are mostly driven by large-scale pre-trained
foundation models (FMs). However, the approaches with which these models are
grounded for human-robot interaction (HRI) perpetuate a master-apprentice
model, where the apprentice (embodied agent) passively receives and executes
the master's (human's) commands without reciprocal learning. This reactive
interaction approach does not capture the co-adaptive dynamics inherent in
everyday multi-turn human-human interactions. To address this, we propose a
Symbiotic Interactive Learning (SIL) approach that enables both the master and
the apprentice to co-adapt through mutual, bidirectional interactions. We
formalised SIL as a co-adaptation process within a shared latent task space,
where the agent and human maintain joint belief states that evolve based on
interaction history. This enables the agent to move beyond reactive execution
to proactive clarification, adaptive suggestions, and shared plan refinement.
To realise these novel behaviours, we leveraged pre-trained FMs for spatial
perception and reasoning, alongside a lightweight latent encoder that grounds
the models' outputs into task-specific representations. Furthermore, to ensure
stability as the tasks evolve, we augment SIL with a memory architecture that
prevents the forgetting of learned task-space representations. We validate SIL
on both simulated and real-world embodied tasks, including instruction
following, information retrieval, query-oriented reasoning, and interactive
dialogues. Demos and resources are public

Abstract: Simulating object deformations is a critical challenge across many scientific
domains, including robotics, manufacturing, and structural mechanics. Learned
Graph Network Simulators (GNSs) offer a promising alternative to traditional
mesh-based physics simulators. Their speed and inherent differentiability make
them particularly well suited for applications that require fast and accurate
simulations, such as robotic manipulation or manufacturing optimization.
However, existing learned simulators typically rely on single-step
observations, which limits their ability to exploit temporal context. Without
this information, these models fail to infer, e.g., material properties.
Further, they rely on auto-regressive rollouts, which quickly accumulate error
for long trajectories. We instead frame mesh-based simulation as a
trajectory-level meta-learning problem. Using Conditional Neural Processes, our
method enables rapid adaptation to new simulation scenarios from limited
initial data while capturing their latent simulation properties. We utilize
movement primitives to directly predict fast, stable and accurate simulations
from a single model call. The resulting approach, Movement-primitive
Meta-MeshGraphNet (M3GN), provides higher simulation accuracy at a fraction of
the runtime cost compared to state-of-the-art GNSs across several tasks.

Abstract: Vision-language-action models (VLAs) trained on large-scale robotic datasets
have demonstrated strong performance on manipulation tasks, including bimanual
tasks. However, because most public datasets focus on single-arm
demonstrations, adapting VLAs for bimanual tasks typically requires substantial
additional bimanual data and fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we
introduce TwinVLA, a modular framework that composes two copies of a pretrained
single-arm VLA into a coordinated bimanual VLA. Unlike monolithic
cross-embodiment models trained on mixtures of single-arm and bimanual data,
TwinVLA improves both data efficiency and performance by composing pretrained
single-arm policies. Across diverse bimanual tasks in real-world and simulation
settings, TwinVLA outperforms a comparably-sized monolithic RDT-1B model
without requiring any bimanual pretraining. Furthermore, it narrows the gap to
state-of-the-art model, $\pi_0$ which rely on extensive proprietary bimanual
data and compute cost. These results establish our modular composition approach
as a data-efficient and scalable path toward high-performance bimanual
manipulation, leveraging public single-arm data.

Abstract: Soft robot manipulators have the potential for deployment in delicate
environments to perform complex manipulation tasks. However, existing obstacle
detection and avoidance methods do not consider limits on the forces that
manipulators may exert upon contact with delicate obstacles. This work
introduces a framework that maps force safety criteria from task space (i.e.
positions along the robot's body) to configuration space (i.e. the robot's
joint angles) and enables real-time force safety detection. We incorporate
limits on allowable environmental contact forces for given task-space
obstacles, and map them into configuration space (C-space) through the
manipulator's forward kinematics. This formulation ensures that configurations
classified as safe are provably below the maximum force thresholds, thereby
allowing us to determine force-safe configurations of the soft robot
manipulator in real-time. We validate our approach in simulation and hardware
experiments on a two-segment pneumatic soft robot manipulator. Results
demonstrate that the proposed method accurately detects force safety during
interactions with deformable obstacles, thereby laying the foundation for
real-time safe planning of soft manipulators in delicate, cluttered
environments.

Abstract: We present ETHOS (Encountered-Type Haptics for On-demand Social Interaction),
a dynamic encountered-type haptic display (ETHD) that enables natural physical
contact in virtual reality (VR) during social interactions such as handovers,
fist bumps, and high-fives. The system integrates a torque-controlled robotic
manipulator with interchangeable passive props (silicone hand replicas and a
baton), marker-based physical-virtual registration via a ChArUco board, and a
safety monitor that gates motion based on the user's head and hand pose. We
introduce two control strategies: (i) a static mode that presents a stationary
prop aligned with its virtual counterpart, consistent with prior ETHD
baselines, and (ii) a dynamic mode that continuously updates prop position by
exponentially blending an initial mid-point trajectory with real-time hand
tracking, generating a unique contact point for each interaction. Bench tests
show static colocation accuracy of 5.09 +/- 0.94 mm, while user interactions
achieved temporal alignment with an average contact latency of 28.53 +/- 31.21
ms across all interaction and control conditions. These results demonstrate the
feasibility of recreating socially meaningful haptics in VR. By incorporating
essential safety and control mechanisms, ETHOS establishes a practical
foundation for high-fidelity, dynamic interpersonal interactions in virtual

Abstract: In this paper, we present an energy-conservation based control architecture
for stable dynamic motion in quadruped robots. We model the robot as a
Spring-loaded Inverted Pendulum (SLIP), a model well-suited to represent the
bouncing motion characteristic of running gaits observed in various biological
quadrupeds and bio-inspired robotic systems. The model permits leg-orientation
control during flight and leg-length control during stance, a design choice
inspired by natural quadruped behaviors and prevalent in robotic quadruped
systems. Our control algorithm uses the reduced-order SLIP dynamics of the
quadruped to track a stable parabolic spline during stance, which is calculated
using the principle of energy conservation. Through simulations based on the
design specifications of an actual quadruped robot, Ghost Robotics Minitaur, we
demonstrate that our control algorithm generates stable bouncing gaits.
Additionally, we illustrate the robustness of our controller by showcasing its
ability to maintain stable bouncing even when faced with up to a 10% error in
sensor measurements.

Motivation: 传统四旋翼无人机采用刚性框架，虽然支持敏捷飞行，但限制了碰撞韧性和在狭窄环境中的通过能力。受生物飞行动物软翅膀的启发，研究人员希望开发一种既能保持飞行性能又能提高环境适应性的无人机设计。

Method: 采用软框架设计方法，使无人机框架具有各向异性刚度和分布式质量-能量结构。通过结构分析确定最佳结构柔软度范围（0.006-0.77 N/mm），使其与自然飞行动物的翅膀刚度相当。

Result: 开发出405克的FlexiQuad原型机，其柔顺性比传统无人机高三个数量级。能够实现峰值速度超过80 km/h的杂技机动，线性和角加速度分别超过3g和300 rad/s²。碰撞韧性提高4倍，能够承受5 m/s的正面撞击，并通过压缩框架实现通过70%标称宽度的狭窄间隙。

Conclusion: FlexiQuad设计在复杂环境中扩展了悬停无人机的能力，实现了在不牺牲飞行性能的前提下进行鲁棒的物理交互。该设计方法适用于20-3000克的不同型号无人机，为无人机在复杂环境中的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Natural flyers use soft wings to seamlessly enable a wide range of flight
behaviours, including agile manoeuvres, squeezing through narrow passageways,
and withstanding collisions. In contrast, conventional quadrotor designs rely
on rigid frames that support agile flight but inherently limit collision
resilience and squeezability, thereby constraining flight capabilities in
cluttered environments. Inspired by the anisotropic stiffness and distributed
mass-energy structures observed in biological organisms, we introduce
FlexiQuad, a soft-frame quadrotor design approach that limits this trade-off.
We demonstrate a 405-gram FlexiQuad prototype, three orders of magnitude more
compliant than conventional quadrotors, yet capable of acrobatic manoeuvres
with peak speeds above 80 km/h and linear and angular accelerations exceeding 3
g and 300 rad/s$^2$, respectively. Analysis demonstrates it can replicate
accelerations of rigid counterparts up to a thrust-to-weight ratio of 8.
Simultaneously, FlexiQuad exhibits fourfold higher collision resilience,
surviving frontal impacts at 5 m/s without damage and reducing destabilising
forces in glancing collisions by a factor of 39. Its frame can fully compress,
enabling flight through gaps as narrow as 70% of its nominal width. Our
analysis identifies an optimal structural softness range, from 0.006 to 0.77
N/mm, comparable to that of natural flyers' wings, whereby agility,
squeezability, and collision resilience are jointly achieved for FlexiQuad
models from 20 to 3000 grams. FlexiQuad expands hovering drone capabilities in
complex environments, enabling robust physical interactions without
compromising flight performance.
