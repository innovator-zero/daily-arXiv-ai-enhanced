We propose Lookahead Unmasking\n(LookUM), which addresses these concerns by reformulating sampling as path\nselection over all possible unmasking orders without the need for an external\nreward model. Our framework couples (i) a path generator that proposes paths by\nsampling from pools of unmasking sets with (ii) a verifier that computes the\nuncertainty of the proposed paths and performs importance sampling to\nsubsequently select the final paths. Empirically, erroneous unmasking\nmeasurably inflates sequence level uncertainty, and our method exploits this to\navoid error-prone trajectories. We validate our framework across six\nbenchmarks, such as mathematics, planning, and coding, and demonstrate\nconsistent performance improvements.

For effective search, we propose a concise yet expressive\npriority function representation. This helps mitigate the combinatorial\nexplosion of the action space in MCTS. Additionally, a probabilistic structural\nrollout strategy is introduced to leverage structural patterns from previously\ndiscovered high-quality priority functions, guiding the rollout process. Our\nexperiments on real-world datasets demonstrate SymLight's superior performance\nacross a range of baselines. A key advantage is SymLight's ability to produce\ninterpretable and deployable TSC policies while maintaining excellent\nperformance."}

To address this issue, we propose\nChannel Capacity Constrained Estimation (C3E), a novel framework that\nformulates the selection of hidden dimensions and depth as a nonlinear\nprogramming problem grounded in information theory. Through modeling spectral\ngraph neural networks as communication channels, our approach directly connects\nchannel capacity to hidden dimensions, propagation depth, propagation\nmechanism, and graph structure. Extensive experiments on nine public datasets\ndemonstrate that hidden dimensions and depths estimated by C3E can mitigate\nover-squashing and consistently improve representation learning. Experimental\nresults show that over-squashing occurs due to the cumulative compression of\ninformation in representation matrices. Furthermore, our findings show that\nincreasing hidden dimensions indeed mitigate information compression, while the\nrole of propagation depth is more nuanced, uncovering a fundamental balance\nbetween information compression and representation complexity."}

This paper introduces\nGazeVLM, a novel Vision-Language Model (VLM) for multi-task gaze understanding\nin images, addressing person detection, gaze target detection, and gaze object\nidentification. While other transformer-based methods exist for gaze analysis,\nGazeVLM represents, to our knowledge, the first application of a VLM to these\ncombined tasks, allowing for selective execution of each task. Through the\nintegration of visual (RGB and depth) and textual modalities, our ablation\nstudy on visual input combinations revealed that a fusion of RGB images with\nHHA-encoded depth maps, guided by text prompts, yields superior performance.

Current fusion\nmethods are typically evaluated on a small selection of public datasets, a\nlimited scope that inadequately represents the complexity and diversity of\nreal-world scenarios, potentially leading to biased evaluations. This issue\npresents a twofold challenge. On one hand, models may overfit to the biases of\nspecific datasets, hindering their generalization to broader practical\napplications.

To overcome these limitations, we propose AnoStyler, a\nlightweight yet effective method that frames zero-shot anomaly generation as\ntext-guided style transfer. Given a single normal image along with its category\nlabel and expected defect type, an anomaly mask indicating the localized\nanomaly regions and two-class text prompts representing the normal and anomaly\nstates are generated using generalizable category-agnostic procedures. A\nlightweight U-Net model trained with CLIP-based loss functions is used to\nstylize the normal image into a visually realistic anomaly image, where\nanomalies are localized by the anomaly mask and semantically aligned with the\ntext prompts.

To address\nthis, we introduce structured inductive priors into the self-attention\nmechanism of the dynamics head: (i) per-head memory-length priors that\nconstrain attention to task-specific windows, and (ii) distributional priors\nthat learn smooth Gaussian weightings over past state-action pairs. We\nintegrate these mechanisms into UniZero, a model-based RL agent with a\nTransformer-based world model that supports planning under partial\nobservability. Experiments on the Atari 100k benchmark show that most\nefficiency gains arise from the Gaussian prior, which smoothly allocates\nattention to informative transitions, while memory-length priors often truncate\nuseful signals with overly restrictive cut-offs. In particular, Gaussian\nAttention achieves a 77% relative improvement in mean human-normalized scores\nover UniZero.

To bridge the gap, we proposed a\nlightweight and plug-and-play Test-time adaptation framework for correcting\nUnseen Normal pattErns (TUNE) in GAD. To address semantic confusion, a graph\naligner is employed to align the shifted data to the original one at the graph\nattribute level. Moreover, we utilize the minimization of representation-level\nshift as a supervision signal to train the aligner, which leverages the\nestimated aggregation contamination as a key indicator of normality shift.\nExtensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that TUNE\nsignificantly enhances the generalizability of pre-trained GAD models to both\nsynthetic and real unseen normal patterns."}

Traditional methods\ntypically rely on logical labels, such as binary indicators (e.g., \"yes/no\")\nthat specify whether an instance belongs to a given category. However, in\npractical applications, label annotations often involve significant uncertainty\ndue to factors such as data noise, inherent ambiguity in the observed entities,\nand the subjectivity of human annotators. Therefore, representing labels using\nsimplistic binary logic can obscure valuable information and limit the\nexpressiveness of label learning models. To overcome this limitation, this\npaper introduces the concept of fuzzy labels, grounded in fuzzy set theory, to\nbetter capture and represent label uncertainty. We further propose an efficient\nfuzzy labeling method that mines and generates fuzzy labels from the original\ndata, thereby enriching the label space with more informative and nuanced\nrepresentations.

This approach\nmitigates the entanglement between the two tasks by initially using\nground-truth poses to aggregate local Gaussians and gradually transitioning to\na mix of predicted and ground-truth poses, which prevents both training\ninstability and exposure bias. We further resolve the scale ambiguity problem\nby a novel pairwise camera-distance normalization scheme and by embedding\ncamera intrinsics into the network. Moreover, YoNoSplat also predicts intrinsic\nparameters, making it feasible for uncalibrated inputs. YoNoSplat demonstrates\nexceptional efficiency, reconstructing a scene from 100 views (at 280x518\nresolution) in just 2.69 seconds on an NVIDIA GH200 GPU.

For instance,\nall open-source T2V models evaluated fail to recognize harmful queries and\noften generate harmful videos, while exhibiting higher levels of unfairness\ncompared to image modality models. In V2T models, unfairness and privacy risks\nrise with scale, whereas hallucination and adversarial robustness improve --\nthough overall performance remains low. Uniquely, safety shows no correlation\nwith model size, implying that factors other than scale govern current safety\nlevels. Our findings highlight the urgent need for developing more robust and\ntrustworthy video foundation models, and VMDT provides a systematic framework\nfor measuring and tracking progress toward this goal.

Factors such as tire\ncharacteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle\nload make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders\ndirect transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a\nframework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial\nand temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system.\nAn RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to\noutput continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a\ntrajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle\ntrajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At\ndeployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal\nalignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for\ndeviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a\nreal vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables\nrobust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to\nreality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from\nlow-level vehicle control."}

Federated learning preserves privacy but deploying large\nvision-language models (VLMs) introduces major energy and sustainability\nchallenges. We compare three strategies for federated violence detection under\nrealistic non-IID splits on the RWF-2000 and RLVS datasets: zero-shot inference\nwith pretrained VLMs, LoRA-based fine-tuning of LLaVA-NeXT-Video-7B, and\npersonalized federated learning of a 65.8M-parameter 3D CNN. All methods exceed\n90% accuracy in binary violence detection. The 3D CNN achieves superior\ncalibration (ROC AUC 92.59%) at roughly half the energy cost (240 Wh vs. 570\nWh) of federated LoRA, while VLMs provide richer multimodal reasoning.\nHierarchical category grouping (based on semantic similarity and class\nexclusion) boosts VLM multiclass accuracy from 65.31% to 81% on the UCF-Crime\ndataset.

A critical flaw in existing methods is that the\npoison rate required for a successful attack induces a proportional, and thus\nnoticeable, drop in Clean Accuracy (CA), undermining their stealthiness. This\npaper presents a new paradigm for clean-image attacks that minimizes this\naccuracy degradation by optimizing the trigger itself. We introduce Generative\nClean-Image Backdoors (GCB), a framework that uses a conditional InfoGAN to\nidentify naturally occurring image features that can serve as potent and\nstealthy triggers. By ensuring these triggers are easily separable from benign\ntask-related features, GCB enables a victim model to learn the backdoor from an\nextremely small set of poisoned examples, resulting in a CA drop of less than\n1%. Our experiments demonstrate GCB's remarkable versatility, successfully\nadapting to six datasets, five architectures, and four tasks, including the\nfirst demonstration of clean-image backdoors in regression and segmentation.\nGCB also exhibits resilience against most of the existing backdoor defenses."}

To this end, we introduce a corruption model\nthat injects artificial disruptions into training images to mimic structural\ndefects. While reminiscent of denoising autoencoders, our approach differs in\ntwo key aspects. First, instead of unstructured i.i.d.\\ noise, we apply\nstructured, spatially coherent perturbations that make the task a hybrid of\nsegmentation and inpainting. Second, and counterintuitively, we add and\npreserve Gaussian noise on top of the occlusions, which acts as a Tikhonov\nregularizer anchoring the Jacobian of the reconstruction function toward\nidentity. This identity-anchored regularization stabilizes reconstruction and\nfurther improves both detection and segmentation accuracy.

Yet, developing downstream vision models for infrared\napplications is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data, due to\nthe specialized expertise required for infrared annotation. While synthetic\ninfrared image generation has the potential to accelerate model development by\nproviding large-scale, diverse training data, training foundation-level\ngenerative diffusion models in the infrared domain has remained elusive due to\nlimited datasets. In light of such data constraints, we explore an\ninference-time scaling approach using a domain-adapted CLIP-based verifier for\nenhanced infrared image generation quality. We adapt FLUX.1-dev, a\nstate-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion model, to the infrared domain by\nfinetuning it on a small sample of infrared images using parameter-efficient\ntechniques. The trained verifier is then employed during inference to guide the\ndiffusion sampling process toward higher quality infrared generations that\nbetter align with input text prompts. Empirically, we find that our approach\nleads to consistent improvements in generation quality, reducing FID scores on\nthe KAIST Multispectral Pedestrian Detection Benchmark dataset by 10% compared\nto unguided baseline samples.

Previous image-based streaming\ndiffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products\nbut have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of\nimage-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved\ntemporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However,\noffline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large\nworkloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict\nservice-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every\nframe must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable\nmulti-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To\naddress this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for\ninteractive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2\nintegrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with\na sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and\nother system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline\norchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps\nand network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency\nguarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments\nand supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both\nultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes.
