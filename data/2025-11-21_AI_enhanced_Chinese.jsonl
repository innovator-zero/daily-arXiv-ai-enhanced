Unlike conventional quadrotors, which are underactuated, this class of quadrotors achieves full actuation, enabling independent motion in all six degrees of freedom. While existing omnidirectional quadrotor designs often require significant structural modifications, the proposed gimballed rotor system maintains a lightweight and easy-to-integrate design by incorporating servo motors within the rotor platforms, allowing independent tilting of each rotor without major alterations to the central structure of a quadrotor. To accommodate this unconventional design, we develop a new control allocation scheme in PX4 Autopilot and present successful flight tests, validating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u91c7\u7528\u4e07\u5411\u8282\u8f6c\u5b50\u673a\u6784\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5168\u5411\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u503e\u659c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u5168\u9a71\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u4e3b\u4f53\u7ed3\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u5927\u4fee\u6539\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u662f\u6b20\u9a71\u52a8\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u516d\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5168\u5411\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u8bbe\u8ba1\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u5e45\u7ed3\u6784\u6539\u52a8\uff0c\u672c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u8f6c\u5b50\u5e73\u53f0\u5185\u96c6\u6210\u8235\u673a\u7535\u673a\uff0c\u4f7f\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8f6c\u5b50\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u503e\u659c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86PX4\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4eea\u4e2d\u7684\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e07\u5411\u8282\u8f6c\u5b50\u673a\u6784\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u5168\u5411\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u6613\u96c6\u6210\u7279\u6027\u3002"}}

Prior approaches often assume fixed goals, reducing goal prediction to a one-time inference. However, in real-world scenarios, humans frequently shift goals, making it challenging for robots to adapt without explicit communication. We propose a method for detecting goal changes by tracking multiple candidate action sequences and verifying their plausibility against a policy bank. Upon detecting a change, the robot refines its belief in relevant past actions and constructs Receding Horizon Planning (RHP) trees to actively select actions that assist the human while encouraging Differentiating Actions to reveal their updated goal. We evaluate our approach in a collaborative cooking environment with up to 30 unique recipes and compare it to three comparable human goal prediction algorithms. Our method outperforms all baselines, quickly converging to the correct goal after a switch, reducing task completion time, and improving collaboration efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efaRHP\u6811\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u534f\u52a9\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7ecf\u5e38\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9014\u6539\u53d8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u56fa\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u660e\u786e\u6c9f\u901a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u8fd9\u79cd\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8ddf\u8e2a\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5408\u7406\u6027\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Receding Horizon Planning\uff08RHP\uff09\u6811\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u9009\u62e9\u534f\u52a9\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5e76\u9f13\u52b1\u533a\u5206\u6027\u52a8\u4f5c\u4ee5\u63ed\u793a\u66f4\u65b0\u540e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b\u591a\u8fbe30\u79cd\u72ec\u7279\u98df\u8c31\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u70f9\u996a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u9884\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u5207\u6362\u540e\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6b63\u786e\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u534f\u4f5c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u4eba\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002"}}

Results show that consequential sounds of the Kinova Gen3 manipulator did not negatively affect perceptions, spatial localization is highly accurate for lateral cues but declines for frontal cues, and spatial sounds can simultaneously convey task-relevant information while promoting warmth and reducing discomfort.

Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2025", "summary": "Many robots are not equipped with a manipulator and many objects are not suitable for prehensile manipulation (such as large boxes and cylinders). In these cases, pushing is a simple yet effective non-prehensile skill for robots to interact with and further change the environment. Existing work often assumes a set of predefined pushing modes and fixed-shape objects. This work tackles the general problem of controlling a robotic fleet to push collaboratively numerous arbitrary objects to respective destinations, within complex environments of cluttered and movable obstacles. It incorporates several characteristic challenges for multi-robot systems such as online task coordination under large uncertainties of cost and duration, and for contact-rich tasks such as hybrid switching among different contact modes, and under-actuation due to constrained contact forces. The proposed method is based on combinatorial hybrid optimization over dynamic task assignments and hybrid execution via sequences of pushing modes and associated forces. It consists of three main components: (I) the decomposition, ordering and rolling assignment of pushing subtasks to robot subgroups; (II) the keyframe guided hybrid search to optimize the sequence of parameterized pushing modes for each subtask; (III) the hybrid control to execute these modes and transit among them.

Thinking models such as R1 and o1 improve their reasoning accuracy at test time as the length of the reasoning context increases. However, compared with training-time scaling, test-time scaling is fundamentally limited by the limited context length of base models, which remains orders of magnitude smaller than the amount of tokens consumed during training. We revisit test-time enhancement techniques through the lens of scaling effect and introduce a unified framework of multi-dimensional test-time scaling to extend the capacity of test-time reasoning. Beyond conventional context-length scaling, we consider two additional dimensions: batch scaling, where accuracy improves with parallel sampling, and turn scaling, where iterative self-refinement enhances reasoning quality. Building on this perspective, we propose 3D test-time scaling, which integrates context, batch, and turn scaling. We show that: (1) each dimension demonstrates a test-time scaling effect, but with a bounded capacity; (2) combining all three dimensions substantially improves the reasoning performance of challenging testbeds, including IOI, IMO, and CPHO, and further benefits from human preference feedback; and (3) the human-in-the-loop framework naturally extends to a more open-ended domain, i.e., embodied learning, which enables the design of humanoid control behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a3D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u6279\u91cf\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u8f6e\u6b21\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u80fd\u529b\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e863D\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u6279\u91cf\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u63d0\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u8f6e\u6b21\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0a\u9650\uff1b2\uff09\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347IOI\u3001IMO\u548cCPHO\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u4e2d\u83b7\u76ca\uff1b3\uff09\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5982\u5177\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4eba\u5f62\u63a7\u5236\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a81\u7834\u5355\u4e00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u5411\u5f00\u653e\u9886\u57df\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Despite significant progress, building a universal VTON framework that can flexibly handle diverse and complex tasks remains a major challenge. Recent methods explore multi-task VTON frameworks guided by textual instructions, yet they still face two key limitations: (1) semantic gap between text instructions and reference images, and (2) data scarcity in complex scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniFit, a universal VTON framework driven by a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Specifically, we introduce an MLLM-Guided Semantic Alignment Module (MGSA), which integrates multimodal inputs using an MLLM and a set of learnable queries. By imposing a semantic alignment loss, MGSA captures cross-modal semantic relationships and provides coherent and explicit semantic guidance for the generative process, thereby reducing the semantic gap. Moreover, by devising a two-stage progressive training strategy with a self-synthesis pipeline, UniFit is able to learn complex tasks from limited data. Extensive experiments show that UniFit not only supports a wide range of VTON tasks, including multi-garment and model-to-model try-on, but also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

We present the \"Semantic Glitch,\" a soft flying robotic art installation whose physical form, a 3D pixel style cloud, is a \"physical glitch\" derived from digital archaeology. We detail a novel autonomous pipeline that rejects conventional sensors like LiDAR and SLAM, relying solely on the qualitative, semantic understanding of a Multimodal Large Language Model to navigate. By authoring a bio-inspired personality for the robot through a natural language prompt, we create a \"narrative mind\" that complements the \"weak,\" historically, loaded body. Our analysis begins with a 13-minute autonomous flight log, and a follow-up study statistically validates the framework's robustness for authoring quantifiably distinct personas. The combined analysis reveals emergent behaviors, from landmark-based navigation to a compelling \"plan to execution\" gap, and a character whose unpredictable, plausible behavior stems from a lack of precise proprioception. This demonstrates a lo-fi framework for creating imperfect companions whose success is measured in character over efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\"\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\"\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6846\u67b6\"\u8bed\u4e49\u6545\u969c\"\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u89d2\u8272\u4e2a\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u6d41\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8ffd\u6c42\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u6545\u610f\u91c7\u7528\"\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u521b\u9020\u5177\u6709\u4e2a\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4f34\u4fa3\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u4f20\u7edf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8d4b\u4e88\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\"\u53d9\u4e8b\u601d\u7ef4\"\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc713\u5206\u949f\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u65e5\u5fd7\u548c\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4ece\u5730\u6807\u5bfc\u822a\u5230\"\u8ba1\u5212\u4e0e\u6267\u884c\"\u5dee\u8ddd\u7b49\u6d8c\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u672c\u4f53\u611f\u77e5\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u4f46\u5408\u7406\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u4ee5\u89d2\u8272\u4e2a\u6027\u4e3a\u6210\u529f\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4f34\u4fa3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u521b\u9020\u6027\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions.

We introduce Bi-AQUA, the first underwater bilateral control-based imitation learning framework that integrates lighting-aware visual processing for underwater robot arms. Bi-AQUA employs a hierarchical three-level lighting adaptation mechanism: a Lighting Encoder that extracts lighting representations from RGB images without manual annotation and is implicitly supervised by the imitation objective, FiLM modulation of visual backbone features for adaptive, lighting-aware feature extraction, and an explicit lighting token added to the transformer encoder input for task-aware conditioning. Experiments on a real-world underwater pick-and-place task under diverse static and dynamic lighting conditions show that Bi-AQUA achieves robust performance and substantially outperforms a bilateral baseline without lighting modeling. Ablation studies further confirm that all three lighting-aware components are critical.

For seen objects, high accuracy is often attainable via per-object fine-tuning but generalizing to unseen objects remains a challenge. To address this problem, past arts assume access to CAD models at test time and typically follow a multi-stage pipeline to estimate poses: detect and segment the object, propose an initial pose, and then refine it. Under occlusion, however, the early-stage of such pipelines are prone to errors, which can propagate through the sequential processing, and consequently degrade the performance. To remedy this shortcoming, we propose four novel extensions to model-based 6D pose estimation methods: (i) a dynamic non-uniform dense sampling strategy that focuses computation on visible regions, reducing occlusion-induced errors; (ii) a multi-hypothesis inference mechanism that retains several confidence-ranked pose candidates, mitigating brittle single-path failures; (iii) iterative refinement to progressively improve pose accuracy; and (iv) series of occlusion-focused training augmentations that strengthen robustness and generalization. Furthermore, we propose a new weighted by visibility metric for evaluation under occlusion to minimize the bias in the existing protocols. Via extensive empirical evaluations, we show that our proposed approach achieves more than 5% improvement in accuracy on ICBIN and more than 2% on BOP dataset benchmarks, while achieving approximately 3 times faster inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u76846D\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u906e\u6321\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eCAD\u6a21\u578b\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5bc6\u96c6\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u805a\u7126\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u5047\u8bbe\u63a8\u7406\u4fdd\u7559\u591a\u4e2a\u59ff\u6001\u5019\u9009\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u9010\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u906e\u6321\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728ICBIN\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc75%\uff0cBOP\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc72%\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7ea63\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u906e\u6321\u4e0b\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u52a0\u6743\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u73b0\u6709\u534f\u8bae\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

Some of these perturbations even survive physical capture, posing security risks to high-stakes applications such as document processing, license plate recognition, and automated compliance systems. Existing defenses, such as adversarial training, input preprocessing, or post-recognition correction, are often model-specific, computationally expensive, and affect performance on unperturbed inputs while remaining vulnerable to unseen or adaptive attacks. To address these challenges, TopoReformer is introduced, a model-agnostic reformation pipeline that mitigates adversarial perturbations while preserving the structural integrity of text images. Topology studies properties of shapes and spaces that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, focusing on global structures such as connectivity, holes, and loops rather than exact distance. Leveraging these topological features, TopoReformer employs a topological autoencoder to enforce manifold-level consistency in latent space and improve robustness without explicit gradient regularization. The proposed method is benchmarked on EMNIST, MNIST, against standard adversarial attacks (FGSM, PGD, Carlini-Wagner), adaptive attacks (EOT, BDPA), and an OCR-specific watermark attack (FAWA).", "AI": {"tldr": "TopoReformer\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u6784\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u9632\u5fa1\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8OCR\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5b9a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u6b63\u5e38\u8f93\u5165\u6027\u80fd\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6216\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u3002\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u5728\u7269\u7406\u6355\u83b7\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b58\u6d3b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u3001\u8f66\u724c\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5e94\u7528\u6784\u6210\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u62d3\u6251\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f3a\u5236\u6d41\u5f62\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u6ce8\u8fde\u901a\u6027\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u3001\u73af\u7b49\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdb\u884c\u663e\u5f0f\u68af\u5ea6\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728EMNIST\u3001MNIST\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\uff08FGSM\u3001PGD\u3001Carlini-Wagner\uff09\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\uff08EOT\u3001BDPA\uff09\u548cOCR\u7279\u5b9a\u6c34\u5370\u653b\u51fb\uff08FAWA\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TopoReformer\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51cf\u8f7b\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6587\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669OCR\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, most deep learning-based methods heavily rely on large amounts of annotated training data, which are typically unavailable for historical maps, especially for those belonging to specific, homogeneous cartographic domains, also known as corpora. Creating high-quality training data suitable for machine learning often takes a significant amount of time and involves extensive manual effort. While synthetic training data can alleviate the scarcity of real-world samples, it often lacks the affinity (realism) and diversity (variation) necessary for effective learning. By transferring the cartographic style of an original historical map corpus onto vector data, we bootstrap an effectively unlimited number of synthetic historical maps suitable for tasks such as land-cover interpretation of a homogeneous historical map corpus. We propose an automatic deep generative approach and a alternative manual stochastic degradation technique to emulate the visual uncertainty and noise, also known as data-dependent uncertainty, commonly observed in historical map scans.

To address this, we propose PIPHEN, an innovative distributed physical cognition-control framework. Its core idea is to replace \"raw data communication\" with \"semantic communication\" by performing \"semantic distillation\" at the robot edge, reconstructing high-dimensional perceptual data into compact, structured physical representations. This idea is primarily realized through two key components: (1) a novel Physical Interaction Prediction Network (PIPN), derived from large model knowledge distillation, to generate this representation; and (2) a Hamiltonian Energy Network (HEN) controller, based on energy conservation, to precisely translate this representation into coordinated actions. Experiments show that, compared to baseline methods, PIPHEN can compress the information representation to less than 5% of the original data volume and reduce collaborative decision-making latency from 315ms to 76ms, while significantly improving task success rates.

There are three main approaches in this domain; Model-based methods assume an exact CAD model at inference but require high-resolution meshes and transfer poorly to new environments; Model-free methods that rely on a few reference images or videos are more flexible, however often fail under challenging conditions; Category-level approaches aim to balance flexibility and accuracy but many are overly general and ignore environment and object priors, limiting their practicality in industrial settings.\n  To this end, we propose Box6d, a category-level 6D pose estimation method tailored for storage boxes in the warehouse context. From a single RGB-D observation, Box6D infers the dimensions of the boxes via a fast binary search and estimates poses using a category CAD template rather than instance-specific models. Suing a depth-based plausibility filter and early-stopping strategy, Box6D then rejects implausible hypotheses, lowering computational cost. We conduct evaluations on real-world storage scenarios and public benchmarks, and show that our approach delivers competitive or superior 6D pose precision while reducing inference time by approximately 76%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Box6D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u4ed3\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b58\u50a8\u7bb1\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea76D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21RGB-D\u89c2\u6d4b\u5feb\u901f\u63a8\u65ad\u7bb1\u5b50\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7c7b\u522bCAD\u6a21\u677f\u4f30\u8ba1\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea676%\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ed3\u5e93\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u3001\u62e3\u9009\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6742\u4e71\u548c\u906e\u6321\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u65b0\u9896\u7269\u4f53\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786eCAD\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff1b\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u597d\u4f46\u6311\u6218\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6613\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u4e8e\u901a\u7528\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u5148\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u6b21RGB-D\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u901f\u4e8c\u5206\u641c\u7d22\u63a8\u65ad\u7bb1\u5b50\u5c3a\u5bf8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u522bCAD\u6a21\u677f\u800c\u975e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u548c\u65e9\u505c\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4ed3\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u548c\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cBox6D\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea676%\u3002", "conclusion": "Box6D\u4e3a\u4ed3\u5e93\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b58\u50a8\u7bb1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u76846D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce DynaMimicGen (D-MG), a scalable dataset generation framework that enables policy training from minimal human supervision while uniquely supporting dynamic task settings. Given only a few human demonstrations, D-MG first segments the demonstrations into meaningful sub-tasks, then leverages Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs) to adapt and generalize the demonstrated behaviors to novel and dynamically changing environments. Improving prior methods that rely on static assumptions or simplistic trajectory interpolation, D-MG produces smooth, realistic, and task-consistent Cartesian trajectories that adapt in real time to changes in object poses, robot states, or scene geometry during task execution. Our method supports different scenarios - including scene layouts, object instances, and robot configurations - making it suitable for both static and highly dynamic manipulation tasks. We show that robot agents trained via imitation learning on D-MG-generated data achieve strong performance across long-horizon and contact-rich benchmarks, including tasks like cube stacking and placing mugs in drawers, even under unpredictable environment changes. By eliminating the need for extensive human demonstrations and enabling generalization in dynamic settings, D-MG offers a powerful and efficient alternative to manual data collection, paving the way toward scalable, autonomous robot learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "DynaMimicGen (D-MG) \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c11\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6536\u96c6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u3002D-MG\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "D-MG\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff08DMPs\uff09\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6f14\u793a\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u65b0\u9896\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3002\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u7b80\u5355\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d2\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cD-MG\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u6ed1\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4efb\u52a1\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u7269\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u573a\u666f\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u5728D-MG\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u5806\u53e0\u548c\u5c06\u676f\u5b50\u653e\u5165\u62bd\u5c49\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "D-MG\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u6f14\u793a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u624b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u800c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, standard OCP faces two key limitations: it operates in the output space using simple nonconformity (NC) scores, and it treats all historical observations uniformly when estimating quantiles. This paper introduces attention-based feature OCP (AFOCP), which addresses both limitations through two key innovations. First, AFOCP operates in the feature space of pre-trained neural networks, leveraging learned representations to construct more compact prediction sets by concentrating on task-relevant information while suppressing nuisance variation. Second, AFOCP incorporates an attention mechanism that adaptively weights historical observations based on their relevance to the current test point, effectively handling non-stationarity and distribution shifts. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that AFOCP maintains long-term coverage while provably achieving smaller prediction intervals than standard OCP under mild regularity conditions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world time series datasets demonstrate that AFOCP consistently reduces the size of prediction intervals by as much as $88\\%$ as compared to OCP, while maintaining target coverage levels, validating the benefits of both feature-space calibration and attention-based adaptive weighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "AFOCP\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6OCP\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8fbe88%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u76ee\u6807\u8986\u76d6\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u5728\u7ebf\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b(OCP)\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u5728\u8f93\u51fa\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u975e\u5171\u5f62\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u6240\u6709\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "AFOCP\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1)\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\uff1b2)\u5f15\u5165\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u6d4b\u503c\u4e0e\u5f53\u524d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u663e\u793aAFOCP\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u957f\u671f\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u6e29\u548c\u6b63\u5219\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6OCP\u66f4\u5c0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAFOCP\u53ef\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u8fbe88%\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u95f4\u5927\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "AFOCP\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6807\u51c6OCP\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

This stems from a critical \\textit{rationale gap}, where sparse domain data is insufficient to bridge the semantic distance between complex spatio-temporal content and abstract classification labels. We propose a two-stage self-improvement paradigm to bridge this gap without new annotations. First, we prompt the VLMs to generate detailed textual rationales for each video, compelling them to articulate the domain-specific logic. The VLM is then fine-tuned on these self-generated rationales, utilizing this intermediate supervision to align its representations with the nuances of the target domain. Second, conventional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is performed on the task labels, achieving markedly higher effectiveness as a result of the model's pre-acquired domain reasoning. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms direct SFT, validating self-generated rationale as an effective, annotation-efficient paradigm for adapting VLMs to domain-specific video analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u65b0\u6807\u6ce8\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u8fde\u63a5\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u5206\u7c7b\u6807\u7b7e", "method": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u63d0\u793aVLM\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8be6\u7ec6\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u903b\u8f91\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u5e38\u89c4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9002\u5e94\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8303\u5f0f", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684VLM\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u6539\u8fdb\u8303\u5f0f\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u7406\u6027\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Existing model-centric optimization paths, such as model compression (which often leads to performance degradation) or policy distillation (whose products are model-dependent and lack generality), fail to fundamentally address this data-level challenge. To this end, this paper introduces FT-NCFM, a fundamentally different, data-centric generative data distillation framework. Our framework employs a self-contained Fact-Tracing (FT) engine that combines causal attribution with programmatic contrastive verification to assess the intrinsic value of samples. Guided by these assessments, an adversarial NCFM process synthesizes a model-agnostic, information-dense, and reusable data asset. Experimental results on several mainstream VLA benchmarks show that models trained on just 5% of our distilled coreset achieve a success rate of 85-90% compared with training on the full dataset, while reducing training time by over 80%.

We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision.

Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has played a pivotal role in multimodal learning. However, its focus on single-label, single-granularity alignment limits its effectiveness in complex domains such as medical imaging, where images often correspond to multiple high-level labels (e.g., disease categories) across different annotation granularities (e.g., diagnostic description, clinical explanation). To address this, we propose Multi-Granular Language Learning (MGLL), a contrastive learning framework designed to improve both multi-label and cross-granularity alignment. MGLL leverages structured multi-label supervision, integrates textual descriptions across granularities, and introduces soft-label supervision with point-wise constraints to enhance alignment. MGLL employs smooth Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to ensure cross-granularity consistency while maintaining computational efficiency as a plug-and-play module for vision-language models. Pretrained on our constructed large-scale multi-granular datasets and evaluated across multiple datasets, MGLL outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in downstream tasks.

Conventional robot cameras, with their small apertures and large depth of field, render both foreground obstacles and background objects in sharp focus, causing occluders to obscure critical scene information. This work establishes a formal connection between animal peering and synthetic aperture (SA) sensing from optical imaging. By having a robot execute a peering motion, its camera describes a wide synthetic aperture. Computational integration of the captured images synthesizes an image with an extremely shallow depth of field, effectively blurring out occluding elements while bringing the background into sharp focus. This efficient, wavelength-independent technique enables real-time, high-resolution perception across various spectral bands. We demonstrate that this approach not only restores basic scene understanding but also empowers advanced visual reasoning in large multimodal models, which fail with conventionally occluded imagery. Unlike feature-dependent multi-view 3D vision methods or active sensors like LiDAR, SA sensing via peering is robust to occlusion, computationally efficient, and immediately deployable on any mobile robot. This research bridges animal behavior and robotics, suggesting that peering motions for synthetic aperture sensing are a key to advanced scene understanding in complex, cluttered environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u7269\u7aa5\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4fa7\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u5bbd\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76f8\u673a\u56e0\u5c0f\u5b54\u5f84\u548c\u5927\u666f\u6df1\u5bfc\u81f4\u524d\u666f\u906e\u6321\u7269\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7269\u4f53\u90fd\u6e05\u6670\u6210\u50cf\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u3002\u53d7\u52a8\u7269\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c6\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u7aa5\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u90e8\u5206\u906e\u6321\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u8ba9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6267\u884c\u7aa5\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f8\u673a\u63cf\u8ff0\u5bbd\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6574\u5408\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6781\u6d45\u666f\u6df1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u7cca\u906e\u6321\u5143\u7d20\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u80cc\u666f\u6e05\u6670\u805a\u7126\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u6216LiDAR\u7b49\u4e3b\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u906e\u6321\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u53ef\u7acb\u5373\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u52a8\u7269\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u672f\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7528\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u5b54\u5f84\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7aa5\u89c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7ea7\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

We propose an automated method to select standard 2D views from 3D cardiac ultrasound volumes, allowing physicians to interpret the data in their usual format while benefiting from the speed and usability of 3D scanning. Applying a deep learning view classifier and downstream heuristics based on anatomical landmarks together with heuristics provided by cardiologists, we reconstruct standard echocardiography views. This approach was validated by three cardiologists in blinded evaluation (96\\% accuracy in 1,600 videos from 2 hospitals). The downstream 2D videos were also validated in their ability to detect cardiac abnormalities using AI echocardiography models (EchoPrime and PanEcho) as well as ability to generate clinical-grade measurements of cardiac anatomy (EchoNet-Measurement). We demonstrated that the extracted 2D videos preserve spatial calibration and diagnostic features, allowing clinicians to obtain accurate real-world interpretations from 3D volumes.

Inducing kinesthetic perception through wearable haptic devices has attracted attention, and various devices have been developed in the past. However, these have been limited to verifications on single body parts, and few have applied the same method to multiple body parts as well. In our previous study, we developed a technology that uses the contraction of artificial muscles to deform clothing in three dimensions. Using this technology, we developed a haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perception of 7 motions in multiple upper body. However, perceptual mixing caused by stimulating multiple human muscles has occurred between the shoulder and the elbow. In this paper, we established a new, simplified design policy and developed a novel haptic suit that induces kinesthetic perceptions in the trunk, shoulder, elbow, and wrist by stimulating joints and muscles independently. We experimentally demonstrated the induced kinesthetic perception and examined the relationship between stimulation and perceived kinesthetic perception under the new design policy. Experiments confirmed that Funabot-Upper successfully induces kinesthetic perception across multiple joints while reducing perceptual mixing observed in previous designs. The new suit improved recognition accuracy from 68.8% to 94.6% compared to the previous Funabot-Suit, demonstrating its superiority and potential for future haptic applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Funabot-Upper\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u5957\u88c5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u8282\u548c\u808c\u8089\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8eaf\u5e72\u3001\u80a9\u90e8\u3001\u8098\u90e8\u548c\u8155\u90e8\u8bf1\u5bfc14\u79cd\u4e0a\u80a2\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u524d\u4ee3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u89e6\u89c9\u8bbe\u5907\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8eab\u4f53\u90e8\u4f4d\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u524d\u4ee3Funabot-Suit\u5728\u80a9\u90e8\u548c\u8098\u90e8\u4e4b\u95f4\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u808c\u8089\u6536\u7f29\u4f7f\u670d\u88c5\u4e09\u7ef4\u53d8\u5f62\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u523a\u6fc0\u5173\u8282\u548c\u808c\u8089\u6765\u8bf1\u5bfc\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u89e6\u89c9\u5957\u88c5Funabot-Upper\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9eFunabot-Upper\u6210\u529f\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5173\u8282\u8bf1\u5bfc\u52a8\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4e4b\u524d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u8bc6\u522b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece\u4e4b\u524d\u768468.8%\u63d0\u5347\u81f394.6%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u524d\u4ee3\u4ea7\u54c1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u90e8\u4f4d\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0cFunabot-Upper\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u6765\u89e6\u89c9\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u548c\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

GLOBE represents solutions as superpositions of learnable Green's-function-like kernels evaluated from boundary faces to targets, composed across multiscale branches and communication hyperlayers. The architecture is translation-, rotation-, and parity-equivariant; discretization-invariant in the fine-mesh limit; and units-invariant via rigorous nondimensionalization. An explicit far-field decay envelope stabilizes extrapolation, boundary-to-boundary hyperlayer communication mediates long-range coupling, and the all-to-all boundary-to-target evaluation yields a global receptive field that respects PDE information flow, even for elliptic PDEs.\n  On AirFRANS (steady incompressible RANS over NACA airfoils), GLOBE achieves substantial accuracy improvements. On the \"Full\" split, it reduces mean-squared error by roughly 200x on all fields relative to the dataset's reference baselines, and roughly 50x relative to the next-best-performing model. In the \"Scarce\" split, it achieves over 100x lower error on velocity and pressure fields and over 600x lower error on surface pressure than Transolver. Qualitative results show sharp near-wall gradients, coherent wakes, and limited errors under modest extrapolation in Reynolds number and angle of attack.\n  In addition to this accuracy, the model is quite compact (117k parameters), and fields can be evaluated at arbitrary points during inference. We also demonstrate the ability to train and predict with non-watertight meshes, which has strong practical implications.\n  These results show that rigorous physics- and domain-inspired inductive biases can achieve large gains in accuracy, generalizability, and practicality for ML-based PDE surrogates for industrial computer-aided engineering (CAE).", "AI": {"tldr": "GLOBE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c42\u89e3\u9f50\u6b21PDE\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u7b49\u53d8ML\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u5728AirFRANS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8ML-based PDE\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7c7b\u683c\u6797\u51fd\u6570\u6838\u4ece\u8fb9\u754c\u9762\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u7684\u53e0\u52a0\u8868\u793a\u89e3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u652f\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u8d85\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u5e73\u79fb\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u5b87\u79f0\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728AirFRANS\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGLOBE\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea6200\u500d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7ea650\u500d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u4ec5117k\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4efb\u610f\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u573a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u9886\u57df\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u5de5\u4e1aCAE\u7684ML-based PDE\u66ff\u4ee3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

However, bipedal locomotion in different environments is still a challenge when it comes to performing stable and dynamic movements. This is where state estimation plays a crucial role, providing fast and accurate feedback of the robot's floating base state to the motion controller. Although classical state estimation methods such as Kalman filters are widely used in robotics, they require expert knowledge to fine-tune the noise parameters. Due to recent advances in the field of machine learning, deep learning methods are increasingly used for state estimation tasks. In this work, we propose the InEKFormer, a novel hybrid state estimation method that incorporates an invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) and a Transformer network.

To improve acceptance and decoding efficiency, recent work has explored the multi-draft extension, where at each step $n$ draft tokens are generated, and the verification criterion is a distribution conditioned on these. When this criterion maximizes the probability of accepting some draft token, it is called the optimal transport (OT). However, finding the OT is difficult, as it is the solution of a linear program (OTLP) in over $V^n$ variables, with $V$ being the vocabulary size. Two recent theoretical works have reframed the OTLP in terms of importance sampling or subset selection. In this work, we prove that these formulations are equivalent to an exponentially large relaxed OTLP, so it remains infeasible to solve. Then, we reverse engineer subset selection to formulate the OTLP as a max-flow problem. With a novel application of polymatroid theory, we reduce the exponentially large OTLP to a convex optimization problem in at most $V$ variables. This allows us to devise an algorithm for optimal $n$-draft speculative sampling when the $n$ tokens are chosen i.i.d. from a single draft model, which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy. Finally, we measure acceptance rates and algorithm runtimes for various $n$ and top-$k$ draft sampling settings. Our findings give the first multi-draft algorithm with 90% acceptance and under 100 ms of overhead per generated token with negligible deviation from the target model distribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u8349\u7a3f\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\u5c06\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690%\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u4e8e100\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u6bcf\u4ee4\u724c\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u8349\u7a3f\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08V^n\u53d8\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u9645\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u591a\u8349\u7a3f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u6d41\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u9762\u4f53\u7406\u8bba\u5c06\u5176\u7b80\u5316\u4e3a\u6700\u591aV\u4e2a\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cdn\u503c\u548ctop-k\u91c7\u6837\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8690%\u7684\u63a5\u53d7\u7387\u548c\u4f4e\u4e8e100\u6beb\u79d2\u7684\u6bcf\u4ee4\u724c\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u5dee\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u8349\u7a3f\u63a8\u6d4b\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing methods that fine-tune CLIP for segmentation on limited seen categories often lead to overfitting and degrade the pretrained vision-language alignment. To stabilize modality alignment during fine-tuning, we propose InfoCLIP, which leverages an information-theoretic perspective to transfer alignment knowledge from pretrained CLIP to the segmentation task. Specifically, this transfer is guided by two novel objectives grounded in mutual information. First, we compress the pixel-text modality alignment from pretrained CLIP to reduce noise arising from its coarse-grained local semantic representations learned under image-text supervision. Second, we maximize the mutual information between the alignment knowledge of pretrained CLIP and the fine-tuned model to transfer compact local semantic relations suited for the segmentation task.

This work introduces Certified Gaussian Manifold Sampling (C-GMS), a novel trajectory-centric RL framework that learns combined DMP and VIC policies while guaranteeing Lyapunov stability and actuator feasibility by construction. Our approach reframes policy exploration as sampling from a mathematically defined manifold of stable gain schedules. This ensures every policy rollout is guaranteed to be stable and physically realizable, thereby eliminating the need for reward penalties or post-hoc validation. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our approach ensures bounded tracking error even in the presence of bounded model errors and deployment-time uncertainties.

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u98de\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u611f\u77e5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u70b9\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u907f\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u969c\u788d\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u548c\u906e\u6321\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8017\u65f6\u4e14\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u590d\u6742\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8ddd\u79bb\u56fe\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u70b9\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u8c03\u5236\u8ddd\u79bb\u573a\u6307\u5bfc\u907f\u969c\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u65e0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4eff\u771f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u73af\u5883\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u907f\u969c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

In humans, this self-monitoring or metacognition is crucial for learning, decision making and problem solving. For instance, they can evaluate how confident they are in performing a task, thus regulating their own behavior and allocating proper resources. Taking inspiration from neuroscience, we propose a robot metacognition architecture centered on confidence (a second-order judgment on decisions) and we demonstrate it on the use case of autonomous tool invention. We propose the use of confidence as a metacognitive measure within the robot decision making scheme.

Existing debiasing methods often rely on large labeled datasets or fine-tuning, which are impractical for foundation-scale models. We explore In-Context Learning (ICL) as a lightweight, tuning-free alternative for improving fairness. Through systematic analysis, we find that conventional demonstration selection (DS) strategies fail to ensure fairness due to demographic imbalance in selected exemplars. To address this, we propose Fairness-Aware Demonstration Selection (FADS), which builds demographically balanced and semantically relevant demonstrations via clustering-based sampling. Experiments on multiple medical imaging benchmarks show that FADS consistently reduces gender-, race-, and ethnicity-related disparities while maintaining strong accuracy, offering an efficient and scalable path toward fair medical image reasoning.

This paper proposes a novel homogeneous Proportional-Integral-Derivative (hPID) control strategy tailored for MRMs to achieve robust and coordinated motion control. Unlike classical PID controllers, the hPID controller leverages the mathematical framework of homogeneous control theory to systematically enhance the stability and convergence properties of the closed-loop system, even in the presence of dynamic uncertainties and external disturbances involved into a system in a homogeneous way. A homogeneous PID structure is designed, ensuring improved convergence of tracking errors through a graded homogeneity approach that generalizes traditional PID gains to nonlinear, state-dependent functions. Stability analysis is conducted using Lyapunov-based methods, demonstrating that the hPID controller guarantees global asymptotic stability and finite-time convergence under mild assumptions.

This problem becomes particularly challenging in the presence of long-tailed in-distribution (ID) datasets, often leading to high false positive rates (FPR) and low tail-class ID classification accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that exploiting inter-sample relationships using a graph-based representation can significantly improve OOD detection in long-tailed recognition of vision datasets. To this end, we use the feature space of a pre-trained model to initialize our graph structure. We account for the differences between the activation layer distribution of the pre-training vs. training data, and actively introduce Gaussianization to alleviate any deviations from a standard normal distribution in the activation layers of the pre-trained model. We then refine this initial graph representation using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to arrive at a feature space suitable for long-tailed OOD detection. This leads us to address the inferior performance observed in ID tail-classes within existing OOD detection methods.

Although incorporating action supervision can alleviate these distractions, its effectiveness is restricted by the scarcity of available action labels. Optical flow represents pixel-level motion between consecutive frames, naturally suppressing background elements and emphasizing moving objects. Motivated by this, we propose robust Latent Action learning with Optical Flow constraints, called LAOF, a pseudo-supervised framework that leverages the agent's optical flow as an action-driven signal to learn latent action representations robust to distractors. Experimental results show that the latent representations learned by LAOF outperform existing methods on downstream imitation learning and reinforcement learning tasks. This superior performance arises from optical flow constraints, which substantially stabilize training and improve the quality of latent representations under extremely label-scarce conditions, while remaining effective as the proportion of action labels increases to 10 percent. Importantly, even without action supervision, LAOF matches or surpasses action-supervised methods trained with 1 percent of action labels.", "AI": {"tldr": "LAOF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4f2a\u76d1\u7763\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u6d41\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u52a8\u4f5c\u65e0\u5173\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u4f5c\u76d1\u7763\u53c8\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u5149\u5b66\u6d41\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u5143\u7d20\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u8fd0\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u88ab\u7528\u4f5c\u52a8\u4f5c\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLAOF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u4f5c\u9a71\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u6d41\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4f2a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLAOF\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5149\u5b66\u6d41\u7ea6\u675f\u663e\u8457\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6781\u5ea6\u7a00\u7f3a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u67091%\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\uff09\u4e5f\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "LAOF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5b66\u6d41\u7ea6\u675f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f7f\u75281%\u52a8\u4f5c\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

A self-supervised representation was pretrained with the large MIR spectral library and the Variational Autoencoder algorithm to obtain a compressed latent space for generating spectral embeddings. At this stage, only unlabeled spectral data were used, allowing us to leverage the full spectral database and the availability of scan repeats for augmented training. We also leveraged and froze the trained MIR decoder for a spectrum conversion task by plugging it into a NIR encoder to learn the mapping between NIR and MIR spectra in an attempt to leverage the predictive capabilities contained in the large MIR library with a low cost portable NIR scanner. This was achieved by using a smaller subset of the KSSL library with paired NIR and MIR spectra. Downstream machine learning models were then trained to map between original spectra, predicted spectra, and latent space embeddings for nine soil properties. The performance of was evaluated independently of the KSSL training data using a gold-standard test set, along with regression goodness-of-fit metrics. Compared to baseline models, the proposed SSML and its embeddings yielded similar or better accuracy in all soil properties prediction tasks. Predictions derived from the spectrum conversion (NIR to MIR) task did not match the performance of the original MIR spectra but were similar or superior to predictive performance of NIR-only models, suggesting the unified spectral latent space can effectively leverage the larger and more diverse MIR dataset for prediction of soil properties not well represented in current NIR libraries.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u571f\u58e4\u5149\u8c31\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5411\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5e93\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5e93\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u5b9e\u73b0\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524d\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u5e93\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u538b\u7f29\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u548c\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c31\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5149\u8c31\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u4e5d\u79cd\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u76f8\u4f3c\u6216\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u8c31\u8f6c\u6362\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u867d\u672a\u8fbe\u5230\u539f\u59cb\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u4f18\u4e8e\u6216\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8c31\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u5927\u3001\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u5f53\u524d\u8fd1\u7ea2\u5916\u5e93\u4e2d\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fbf\u643a\u5f0f\u571f\u58e4\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Wearable attacks offer a realistic threat model, yet existing approaches usually optimize textures frame by frame and therefore fail to maintain concealment across long video sequences with motion, pose changes, and garment deformation. In this work, a sequence-level optimization framework is introduced to generate natural, printable adversarial textures for shirts, trousers, and hats that remain effective throughout entire walking videos in both digital and physical settings. Product images are first mapped to UV space and converted into a compact palette and control-point parameterization, with ICC locking to keep all colors printable. A physically based human-garment pipeline is then employed to simulate motion, multi-angle camera viewpoints, cloth dynamics, and illumination variation. An expectation-over-transformation objective with temporal weighting is used to optimize the control points so that detection confidence is minimized across whole sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate strong and stable concealment, high robustness to viewpoint changes, and superior cross-model transferability.

While current slicing technologies offer advanced support strategies, they focus on post-processing optimizations rather than addressing the underlying need for support-efficient design during the model generation phase. This paper introduces SEG (\\textit{\\underline{S}upport-\\underline{E}ffective \\underline{G}eneration}), a novel framework that integrates Direct Preference Optimization with an Offset (ODPO) into the 3D generation pipeline to directly optimize models for minimal support material usage. By incorporating support structure simulation into the training process, SEG encourages the generation of geometries that inherently require fewer supports, thus reducing material waste and production time.

Using tools such as NetLogo's BehaviorSpace and Python, two epidemic synthetic datasets were generated and prepared for the application of several ML algorithms.

The predictions performed well, with low error metrics and high R^2 values (0.997, 1.000, 0.999, 1.000), indicating an effective fit to the training set.

In real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), existing approaches mainly rely on fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models through Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images. However, these dense Real-ISR models are limited in their ability to adaptively capture the heterogeneous characteristics of complex real-world degraded samples or enable knowledge sharing between inputs under equivalent computational budgets. To address this, we investigate the integration of sparse MoE into Real-ISR and propose a Mixture-of-Ranks (MoR) architecture for single-step image super-resolution. We introduce a fine-grained expert partitioning strategy that treats each rank in LoRA as an independent expert. This design enables flexible knowledge recombination while isolating fixed-position ranks as shared experts to preserve common-sense features and minimize routing redundancy. Furthermore, we develop a degradation estimation module leveraging CLIP embeddings and predefined positive-negative text pairs to compute relative degradation scores, dynamically guiding expert activation. To better accommodate varying sample complexities, we incorporate zero-expert slots and propose a degradation-aware load-balancing loss, which dynamically adjusts the number of active experts based on degradation severity, ensuring optimal computational resource allocation.

Stochastic Gradient Descent Unlearning", "comment": null, "summary": "Machine unlearning algorithms aim to remove the impact of selected training data from a model without the computational expenses of retraining from scratch. Two such algorithms are ``Descent-to-Delete\" (D2D) and ``Rewind-to-Delete\" (R2D), full-batch gradient descent algorithms that are easy to implement and satisfy provable unlearning guarantees. In particular, the stochastic version of D2D is widely implemented as the ``finetuning\" unlearning baseline, despite lacking theoretical backing on nonconvex functions. In this work, we prove $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$ certified unlearning guarantees for stochastic R2D and D2D for strongly convex, convex, and nonconvex loss functions, by analyzing unlearning through the lens of disturbed or biased gradient systems, which may be contracting, semi-contracting, or expansive respectively. Our argument relies on optimally coupling the random behavior of the unlearning and retraining trajectories, resulting in a probabilistic sensitivity bound that can be combined with a novel relaxed Gaussian mechanism to achieve $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$ unlearning. We determine that D2D can yield tighter guarantees for strongly convex functions compared to R2D by relying on contraction to a unique global minimum. However, unlike D2D, R2D can achieve unlearning in the convex and nonconvex setting because it draws the unlearned model closer to the retrained model by reversing the accumulated disturbances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u673aR2D\u548cD2D\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u3001\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684(\u03b5, \u03b4)\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u6270\u6216\u6709\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u79fb\u9664\u9009\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4ece\u5934\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002D2D\u548cR2D\u662f\u4e24\u79cd\u6613\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e14\u6ee1\u8db3\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u673a\u7248\u672c\u7684D2D\u7f3a\u4e4f\u975e\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53d7\u6270\u6216\u6709\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6536\u7f29\u3001\u534a\u6536\u7f29\u6216\u6269\u5f20\uff09\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u8026\u5408\u6280\u672f\u5206\u6790\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u968f\u673a\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u65b0\u578b\u677e\u5f1b\u9ad8\u65af\u673a\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0(\u03b5, \u03b4)\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u673aR2D\u548cD2D\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u3001\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e0b\u7684(\u03b5, \u03b4)\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002D2D\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u7f29\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u5c0f\u503c\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u800cR2D\u5728\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u8f6c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6270\u52a8\u4f7f\u9057\u5fd8\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u5404\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff1aD2D\u5728\u5f3a\u51f8\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800cR2D\u5728\u51f8\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Speckle sensing has emerged as a promising method to monitor the cutting process and identify material types in real-time. This paper proposes a material classification technique using a speckle pattern of the material's surface based on deep learning to monitor and control the laser cutting process. The proposed method involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on a dataset of laser speckle patterns to recognize distinct material types for safe and efficient cutting. Previous methods for material classification using speckle sensing may face issues when the color of the laser used to produce the speckle pattern is changed. Experiments conducted in this study demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in material classification, even when the laser color is changed. The model achieved an accuracy of 98.30 % on the training set and 96.88% on the validation set. Furthermore, the model was evaluated on a set of 3000 new images for 30 different materials, achieving an F1-score of 0.9643.

It is generated through a highly autonomous, fully decoupled, and compositional simulation pipeline that enables long-horizon skill composition, flexible task assembly, and heterogeneous embodiments with minimal manual tuning.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that synergistically integrates two complementary approaches: Sub-treatment Group Alignment (SGA) and Random Temporal Masking (RTM). Instead of the coarse practice of aligning marginal distributions of the treatments in latent space, SGA uses iterative treatment-agnostic clustering to identify fine-grained sub-treatment groups. Aligning these fine-grained groups achieves improved distributional matching, thus leading to more effective deconfounding. We theoretically demonstrate that SGA optimizes a tighter upper bound on counterfactual risk and empirically verify its deconfounding efficacy. RTM promotes temporal generalization by randomly replacing input covariates with Gaussian noises during training. This encourages the model to rely less on potentially noisy or spuriously correlated covariates at the current step and more on stable historical patterns, thereby improving its ability to generalize across time and better preserve underlying causal relationships. Our experiments demonstrate that while applying SGA and RTM individually improves counterfactual outcome estimation, their synergistic combination consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. This success comes from their distinct yet complementary roles: RTM enhances temporal generalization and robustness across time steps, while SGA improves deconfounding at each specific time point.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5b50\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u968f\u673a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ece\u672a\u88ab\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\uff0c\u4e14\u6df7\u6dc6\u53d8\u91cf\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u53d8\u5e76\u626d\u66f2\u6bcf\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1", "method": "SGA\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6cbb\u7597\u65e0\u5173\u805a\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b50\u6cbb\u7597\u7ec4\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff1bRTM\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u66ff\u6362\u8f93\u5165\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSGA\u548cRTM\u5355\u72ec\u5e94\u7528\u90fd\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u679c\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u5408\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "SGA\u548cRTM\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u4f5c\u7528\uff1aRTM\u589e\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u6cdb\u5316\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0cSGA\u6539\u8fdb\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u53bb\u6df7\u6dc6\u6548\u679c"}}

However, extending 3DGS to sparse-view settings remains challenging because of supervision scarcity and overfitting caused by limited viewpoint coverage. In this paper, we present CuriGS, a curriculum-guided framework for sparse-view 3D reconstruction using 3DGS. CuriGS addresses the core challenge of sparse-view synthesis by introducing student views: pseudo-views sampled around ground-truth poses (teacher). For each teacher, we generate multiple groups of student views with different perturbation levels. During training, we follow a curriculum schedule that gradually unlocks higher perturbation level, randomly sampling candidate students from the active level to assist training. Each sampled student is regularized via depth-correlation and co-regularization, and evaluated using a multi-signal metric that combines SSIM, LPIPS, and an image-quality measure. For every teacher and perturbation level, we periodically retain the best-performing students and promote those that satisfy a predefined quality threshold to the training set, resulting in a stable augmentation of sparse training views. Experimental results show that CuriGS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both rendering fidelity and geometric consistency across various synthetic and real sparse-view scenes.

We claim that with simple yet sufficiently powerful hardware for obtaining human data and our proposed framework AINA, we are now one significant step closer to achieving this dream. AINA enables learning multi-fingered policies from data collected by anyone, anywhere, and in any environment using Aria Gen 2 glasses. These glasses are lightweight and portable, feature a high-resolution RGB camera, provide accurate on-board 3D head and hand poses, and offer a wide stereo view that can be leveraged for depth estimation of the scene. This setup enables the learning of 3D point-based policies for multi-fingered hands that are robust to background changes and can be deployed directly without requiring any robot data (including online corrections, reinforcement learning, or simulation).

While traditional data-driven methods attempt to bridge this gap using satellite Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), they often suffer from severe, non-random data missingness (e.g., due to cloud cover or nighttime) and inversion biases. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes the Spatiotemporal Physics-Guided Inference Network (SPIN), a novel framework designed for inductive spatiotemporal kriging. Unlike conventional approaches, SPIN synergistically integrates domain knowledge into deep learning by explicitly modeling physical advection and diffusion processes via parallel graph kernels. Crucially, we introduce a paradigm-shifting training strategy: rather than using error-prone AOD as a direct input, we repurpose it as a spatial gradient constraint within the loss function. This allows the model to learn structural pollution patterns from satellite data while remaining robust to data voids. Validated in the highly polluted Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas (BTHSA), SPIN achieves a new state-of-the-art with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 9.52 ug/m^3, effectively generating continuous, physically plausible pollution fields even in unmonitored areas.

This includes the collection of heterogeneous data across multiple platforms, with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) seeing significant usage due to their high performance in crop monitoring, forecasting, and prediction tasks. Similarly, satellite missions have been shown to be effective for agriculturally relevant tasks. In contrast to UAVs, such missions are bound to the limitation of spatial resolution, which hinders their effectiveness for modern farming systems focused on micro-plot management. In this work, we propose a cross modal learning strategy that enriches high-resolution satellite imagery with UAV level visual detail for crop canopy trait estimation. Using a dataset of approximately co registered satellite UAV image pairs collected from replicated plots of 84 hybrid maize varieties across five distinct locations in the U.S. Corn Belt, we train a model that learns fine grained spectral spatial correspondences between sensing modalities. Results show that the generated UAV-like representations from satellite inputs consistently outperform real satellite imagery on multiple downstream tasks, including yield and nitrogen prediction, demonstrating the potential of cross-modal correspondence learning to bridge the gap between satellite and UAV sensing in agricultural monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7528\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f5c\u7269\u51a0\u5c42\u6027\u72b6\u4f30\u8ba1", "motivation": "\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u53d7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u73b0\u4ee3\u5fae\u5730\u5757\u7ba1\u7406\u519c\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f46\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u536b\u661f-\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5149\u8c31\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6837\u8868\u793a\u5728\u4ea7\u91cf\u548c\u6c2e\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf", "conclusion": "\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u5f25\u5408\u519c\u4e1a\u76d1\u6d4b\u4e2d\u536b\u661f\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f20\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd"}}

However, research studies have shown that LLMs lack the ability to identify causal relationships, a fundamental cornerstone of human intelligence. We first conduct an exploratory investigation of LLMs' behavior when asked to perform a causal-discovery task and find that they mostly rely on the semantic meaning of variable names, ignoring the observation data. This is unsurprising, given that LLMs were never trained to process structural datasets. To first tackle this challenge, we prompt the LLMs with the outputs of established causal discovery algorithms designed for observational datasets. These algorithm outputs effectively serve as the sufficient statistics of the observation data. However, quite surprisingly, we find that prompting the LLMs with these sufficient statistics decreases the LLMs' performance in causal discovery. To address this current limitation, we propose CARE, a framework that enhances LLMs' causal-reasoning ability by teaching them to effectively utilize the outputs of established causal-discovery algorithms through supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results show that a finetuned Qwen2.5-1.5B model produced by CARE significantly outperforms both traditional causal-discovery algorithms and state-of-the-art LLMs with over a thousand times more parameters, demonstrating effective utilization of its own knowledge and the external algorithmic clues.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faCARE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6559\u4f1aLLMs\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7CARE\u5fae\u8c03\u76841.5B\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5343\u500d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLLMs\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc6\u522b\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u53d8\u91cf\u540d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u542b\u4e49\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002\u867d\u7136LLMs\u4ece\u672a\u63a5\u53d7\u8fc7\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u4e3aLLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5145\u5206\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCARE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6559\u4f1aLLMs\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u505a\u6cd5\u662f\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u8ba9LLMs\u5b66\u4e60\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u8eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7CARE\u5fae\u8c03\u7684Qwen2.5-1.5B\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u8d85\u8fc7\u5343\u500d\u7684\u5148\u8fdbLLMs\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "CARE\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLMs\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLMs\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Integrating language features into SLAM remains a significant challenge, as storing high-dimensional features demands excessive memory and rendering overhead, while existing methods with static models lack adaptability for novel environments. To address these limitations, we propose LEGO-SLAM (Language-Embedded Gaussian Optimization SLAM), the first framework to achieve real-time, open-vocabulary mapping within a 3DGS-based SLAM system. At the core of our method is a scene-adaptive encoder-decoder that distills high-dimensional language embeddings into a compact 16-dimensional feature space. This design reduces the memory per Gaussian and accelerates rendering, enabling real-time performance. Unlike static approaches, our encoder adapts online to unseen scenes. These compact features also enable a language-guided pruning strategy that identifies semantic redundancy, reducing the map's Gaussian count by over 60\\% while maintaining rendering quality.

While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time.

While Key and Value (KV) caching in large language models (LLMs) has been extensively studied, next-scale prediction presents unique challenges, and KV caching design for next-scale based VAR transformers remains largely unexplored. A major bottleneck is the excessive KV memory growth with the increasing number of scales-severely limiting scalability. Our systematic investigation reveals that: (1) Attending to tokens from local scales significantly contributes to generation quality (2) Allocating a small amount of memory for the coarsest scales, termed as condensed scales, stabilizes multi-scale image generation (3) Strong KV similarity across finer scales is predominantly observed in cache-efficient layers, whereas cache-demanding layers exhibit weaker inter-scale similarity. Based on the observations, we introduce AMS-KV, a scale-adaptive KV caching policy for next-scale prediction in VAR models. AMS-KV prioritizes storing KVs from condensed and local scales, preserving the most relevant tokens to maintain generation quality. It further optimizes KV cache utilization and computational efficiency identifying cache-demanding layers through inter-scale similarity analysis. Compared to the vanilla next-scale prediction-based VAR models, AMS-KV reduces KV cache usage by up to 84.83% and self-attention latency by 60.48%.

Existing self-evolution frameworks offer an alternative but are typically restricted by the model's inherent capabilities and single-round interactions, hindering the development of complex curricula involving tool use or dynamic reasoning. We introduce Agent0, a fully autonomous framework that evolves high-performing agents without external data through multi-step co-evolution and seamless tool integration. Agent0 establishes a symbiotic competition between two agents initialized from the same base LLM: a curriculum agent that proposes increasingly challenging frontier tasks, and an executor agent that learns to solve them. We integrate external tools to enhance the executor's problem-solving capacity; this improvement, in turn, pressures the curriculum agent to construct more complex, tool-aware tasks. Through this iterative process, Agent0 establishes a self-reinforcing cycle that continuously produces high-quality curricula.

This task is inherently challenging due to the sensor's unique spherical geometry, the temporal sparsity of point clouds, and the complexity of dynamic scenes. To address these challenges, we present LiSTAR, a novel generative world model that operates directly on the sensor's native geometry. LiSTAR introduces a Hybrid-Cylindrical-Spherical (HCS) representation to preserve data fidelity by mitigating quantization artifacts common in Cartesian grids. To capture complex dynamics from sparse temporal data, it utilizes a Spatio-Temporal Attention with Ray-Centric Transformer (START) that explicitly models feature evolution along individual sensor rays for robust temporal coherence. Furthermore, for controllable synthesis, we propose a novel 4D point cloud-aligned voxel layout for conditioning and a corresponding discrete Masked Generative START (MaskSTART) framework, which learns a compact, tokenized representation of the scene, enabling efficient, high-resolution, and layout-guided compositional generation. Comprehensive experiments validate LiSTAR's state-of-the-art performance across 4D LiDAR reconstruction, prediction, and conditional generation, with substantial quantitative gains: reducing generation MMD by a massive 76%, improving reconstruction IoU by 32%, and lowering prediction L1 Med by 50%. This level of performance provides a powerful new foundation for creating realistic and controllable autonomous systems simulations.

Change-of-basis (CoB) pruning addresses this challenge by applying orthogonal linear transformations that concentrate importance within certain dimensions. However, many standard deep learning architectures are not inherently invariant to such transformations. To enable compatibility, we introduce two-subspace radial activations (TSRAs): an activation family that is invariant to orthogonal linear transformations applied independently within its two activation subspaces. This invariance allows CoB transformations to be merged into surrounding weights without incurring extra parameters. We position this work as a proof-of-concept that a rotationally invariant design may offer a principled approach towards change-of-basis pruning. We do not provide an analysis of multiple TSRA candidates nor do we explore weight initialization for any TSRAs. These limitations, combined with other necessary modifications we make to permit rotational invariance, result in a slight accuracy drop of $4.52\\%$ compared to a ReLU-based control. However, using activation-magnitude importance, VGG-16 implementing our CoB+TSRA framework shows encouraging results on CIFAR-10. Under fixed-ratio structured pruning, CoB improves accuracy over a TSRA baseline at all pruning ratios and extends reliable pruning frontier from roughly $30\\%$ to $70\\%$ of parameters without post-prune fine tuning. Under threshold-based pruning strategies, CoB prunes $90-96\\%$ of parameters while maintaining $1-6\\%$ accuracy drop after fine-tuning. Together, these results indicate that rotationally invariant architectures may offer a promising path towards CoB pruning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53cc\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f84\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570(TSRA)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7f51\u7edc\u80fd\u591f\u517c\u5bb9\u57fa\u53d8\u6362(CoB)\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u57fa\u53d8\u6362\u526a\u679d\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5c06\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f84\u5411\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570(TSRA)\uff0c\u8be5\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\u5bf9\u5176\u4e24\u4e2a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5185\u72ec\u7acb\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u7ebf\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u57fa\u53d8\u6362\u53ef\u4ee5\u5408\u5e76\u5230\u5468\u56f4\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728VGG-16\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528CoB+TSRA\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65f6CoB\u5728\u6240\u6709\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8eTSRA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u526a\u679d\u8fb9\u754c\u4ece\u7ea630%\u6269\u5c55\u523070%\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u7684\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4ee5\u526a\u966490-96%\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d1-6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u67b6\u6784\u4e3a\u57fa\u53d8\u6362\u526a\u679d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524d\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4ReLU\u57fa\u7ebf\u67094.52%\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee4\u4eba\u9f13\u821e\u3002"}}

To address this, we propose \\textbf{VideoSeg-R1}, the first framework to introduce reinforcement learning into video reasoning segmentation. It adopts a decoupled architecture that formulates the task as joint referring image segmentation and video mask propagation. It comprises three stages: (1) A hierarchical text-guided frame sampler to emulate human attention; (2) A reasoning model that produces spatial cues along with explicit reasoning chains; and (3) A segmentation-propagation stage using SAM2 and XMem.

We propose a Gauge-Equivariant Graph Network with Self-Interference Cancellation (GESC), which replaces additive aggregation with a projection-based interference mechanism. Unlike prior magnetic or gauge-equivariant GNNs that typically focus on phase handling in spectral filtering while largely relying on scalar weighting, GESC introduces a $\\mathrm{U}(1)$ phase connection followed by a rank-1 projection that attenuates self-parallel components before attention. A sign- and phase-aware gate further regulates neighbor influence, attenuating components aligned with current node states and acting as a local notch on low-frequency modes. Across diverse graph benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms recent state-of-the-art models while offering a unified, interference-aware view of message passing.

This study introduces SpectralTrain, a universal, architecture-agnostic training framework that enhances learning efficiency by integrating curriculum learning (CL) with principal component analysis (PCA)-based spectral downsampling. By gradually introducing spectral complexity while preserving essential information, SpectralTrain enables efficient learning of spectral -- spatial patterns at significantly reduced computational costs. The framework is independent of specific architectures, optimizers, or loss functions and is compatible with both classical and state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets -- Indian Pines, Salinas-A, and the newly introduced CloudPatch-7 -- demonstrate strong generalization across spatial scales, spectral characteristics, and application domains. The results indicate consistent reductions in training time by 2-7x speedups with small-to-moderate accuracy deltas depending on backbone. Its application to cloud classification further reveals potential in climate-related remote sensing, emphasizing training strategy optimization as an effective complement to architectural design in HSI models.

To address these challenges, we propose ILoRA, a unified framework that integrates three core innovations: a QR-based orthonormal initialization to ensure all clients start in a coherent subspace; a Concatenated QR Aggregation mechanism that fuses heterogeneous-rank updates via concatenation and decomposition, preserving information while maintaining dimension alignment; and an AdamW optimizer with rank-aware control variates to correct local updates and mitigate client drift.

Additionally, unsynchronized image frames are leveraged to globally refine the 3D Gaussian representation, enhancing texture consistency and novel view synthesis fidelity. Furthermore, the global octree structure coupled with a targeted Gaussian primitive management strategy further suppresses noise and significantly reduces memory consumption in large-scale environments. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that Rad-GS achieves performance comparable to traditional 3D Gaussian methods based on camera or LiDAR inputs, highlighting the feasibility of robust outdoor mapping using 4D mmWave radar.

This article describes a new two-step process to design a more refined resume evaluation model based on a small language model (<600M parameters) that is finetuned using GRPO on a custom reward function. To begin with, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) was used to build a solid baseline model. Second, this SFT model was also optimized with the help of Reinforcement Learning (RL) through GRPO under the guidance of a new, multi-component reward function that can holistically assess candidates beyond simple keyword matching. We indicate that the RL application presents a critical problem of reward hacking due to the initial experiments of aggressive penalties, which produces faulty, excessively negative model behaviors. We have overcome this challenge by refining the reward function repeatedly and training hyperparameters into a stable \"gentle polishing process\" of the reward function. Our resulting GRPO-polished model demonstrates significant real-world efficacy, achieving a final accuracy of 91% on unseen test data. The model shows a strong ability to correctly identify qualified candidates (recall of 0.85 for the 'SELECTED' class) while also showing exceptional precision (1.0), confirming its reliability. These results indicate that a properly executed, two-step fine-tuning procedure can indeed effectively refine a small language model to be able to conduct fine-tuned and human-like candidate scoring, overcoming the drawbacks of both traditional ATS and naive RL usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7b80\u5386\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfATS\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8691%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7533\u8bf7\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf(ATS)\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u56e0\u7ec6\u5fae\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u62d2\u7edd\u4f18\u79c0\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u66f4\u4eba\u6027\u5316\u7684\u7b80\u5386\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u591a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u590d\u8c03\u6574\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523091%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9'SELECTED'\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4e3a0.85\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5ea6\u4e3a1.0\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u5019\u9009\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9002\u5f53\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u5fae\u8c03\u7a0b\u5e8f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u884c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4e14\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edfATS\u548c\u539f\u59cbRL\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002"}}

Recent advances in visual in-context learning (VICL) demonstrate promising capabilities for solving downstream tasks by unified vision-language models (VLMs). When the visual prompt and the target images originate from different visual tasks, can VLMs still enable VICL? In the paper, we propose a fully collaborative pipeline, i.e. T2T-VICL, for VLMs to investigate the potential of cross-task VICL. Fundamentally, we design a mechanism to generate and select text prompts that best implicitly describe the differences between two distinct low-level vision tasks, and construct the first cross-task VICL dataset. Building upon this, we propose a novel inference framework that combines perceptual score-based reasoning with traditional evaluation metrics to perform cross-task VICL.

This work investigates the \"Adaptive Orthogonal Polynomial Filter\" (AOPF) class as a solution. We introduce two models operating in the [-1, 1] domain: 1) `L-JacobiNet`, the adaptive generalization of `ChebyNet` with learnable alpha, beta shape parameters, and 2) `S-JacobiNet`, a novel baseline representing a LayerNorm-stabilized static `ChebyNet`. Our analysis, comparing these models against AOPFs in the [0, infty) domain (e.g., `LaguerreNet`), reveals critical, previously unknown trade-offs. We find that the [0, infty) domain is superior for modeling heterophily, while the [-1, 1] domain (Jacobi) provides superior numerical stability at high K (K>20). Most significantly, we discover that `ChebyNet`'s main flaw is stabilization, not its static nature. Our static `S-JacobiNet` (ChebyNet+LayerNorm) outperforms the adaptive `L-JacobiNet` on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets, identifying `S-JacobiNet` as a powerful, overlooked baseline and suggesting that adaptation in the [-1, 1] domain can lead to overfitting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff08AOPF\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8c31GNNs\uff08\u5982ChebyNet\uff09\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1aL-JacobiNet\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ChebyNet\uff09\u548cS-JacobiNet\uff08\u9759\u6001ChebyNet+LayerNorm\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0[-1,1]\u57df\u5728\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c[0,\u221e)\u57df\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\u3002\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\u662fChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5728\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "motivation": "\u8c31GNNs\u5982ChebyNet\u7531\u4e8e\u9759\u6001\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u4ea4\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5728[-1,1]\u57df\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09L-JacobiNet\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ChebyNet\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684alpha\u3001beta\u5f62\u72b6\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c2\uff09S-JacobiNet\uff08LayerNorm\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9759\u6001ChebyNet\uff09\u3002\u5e76\u4e0e[0,\u221e)\u57df\u7684AOPFs\uff08\u5982LaguerreNet\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0[0,\u221e)\u57df\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4e0a\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u800c[-1,1]\u57df\uff08Jacobi\uff09\u5728\u9ad8K\uff08K>20\uff09\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6700\u5173\u952e\u7684\u662f\u53d1\u73b0ChebyNet\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u7f3a\u9677\u662f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u9759\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u3002S-JacobiNet\u57285\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u76844\u4e2a\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94L-JacobiNet\u3002", "conclusion": "S-JacobiNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u4f46\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5728[-1,1]\u57df\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u9759\u6001ChebyNet+LayerNorm\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u66f4\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u3002"}}

Due to limitations in dataset sizes, many models are trained by aggregating bioactivity data from diverse sources, including public databases such as ChEMBL. However, this approach often introduces significant noise due to variability in experimental protocols. We introduce AssayMatch, a framework for data selection that builds smaller, more homogenous training sets attuned to the test set of interest. AssayMatch leverages data attribution methods to quantify the contribution of each training assay to model performance. These attribution scores are used to finetune language embeddings of text-based assay descriptions to capture not just semantic similarity, but also the compatibility between assays. Unlike existing data attribution methods, our approach enables data selection for a test set with unknown labels, mirroring real-world drug discovery campaigns where the activities of candidate molecules are not known in advance. At test time, embeddings finetuned with AssayMatch are used to rank all available training data. We demonstrate that models trained on data selected by AssayMatch are able to surpass the performance of the model trained on the complete dataset, highlighting its ability to effectively filter out harmful or noisy experiments.

Building on temporal-difference error-driven regularization (TDDR), a double actor-critic framework, this work introduces enhanced methods to achieve flexible bias control and stronger representation learning. We propose three convex combination strategies, symmetric and asymmetric, that balance pessimistic estimates to mitigate overestimation and optimistic exploration via double actors to alleviate underestimation. A single hyperparameter governs this mechanism, enabling tunable control across the bias spectrum. To further improve performance, we integrate augmented state and action representations into the actor and critic networks.

Thus, most flow-based Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) methods first predict bidirectional flows at low resolution and then use high-magnification upsampling (e.g., bilinear) to obtain the high-resolution ones. However, this kind of upsampling strategy may cause blur or mosaic at the flows' edges. Additionally, the motion of fine pixels at high resolution cannot be adequately captured in motion estimation at low resolution, which leads to the misalignment of task-oriented flows. With such inaccurate flows, input frames are warped and combined pixel-by-pixel, resulting in ghosting and discontinuities in the interpolated frame. In this study, we propose a novel VFI pipeline, VTinker, which consists of two core components: guided flow upsampling (GFU) and Texture Mapping. After motion estimation at low resolution, GFU introduces input frames as guidance to alleviate the blurring details in bilinear upsampling flows, which makes flows' edges clearer. Subsequently, to avoid pixel-level ghosting and discontinuities, Texture Mapping generates an initial interpolated frame, referred to as the intermediate proxy.

This trade-off is dictated by the choice of spectral domain. Filters in the finite [-1, 1] domain (e.g., ChebyNet) are numerically stable at high polynomial degrees (K) but are static and low-pass, causing them to fail on heterophilic graphs. Conversely, filters in the semi-infinite [0, infty) domain (e.g., KrawtchoukNet) are highly adaptive and achieve SOTA results on heterophily by learning non-low-pass responses. However, as we demonstrate, these adaptive filters can also suffer from numerical instability, leading to catastrophic performance collapse at high K. In this paper, we propose to resolve this trade-off by designing a hybrid-domain GNN, HybSpecNet, which combines a stable `ChebyNet` branch with an adaptive `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We first demonstrate that a \"naive\" hybrid architecture, which fuses the branches via concatenation, successfully unifies performance at low K, achieving strong results on both homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks. However, we then prove that this naive architecture fails the stability test. Our K-ablation experiments show that this architecture catastrophically collapses at K=25, exactly mirroring the collapse of its unstable `KrawtchoukNet` branch. We identify this critical finding as \"Instability Poisoning,\" where `NaN`/`Inf` gradients from the adaptive branch destroy the training of the model. Finally, we propose and validate an advanced architecture that uses \"Late Fusion\" to completely isolate the gradient pathways. We demonstrate that this successfully solves the instability problem, remaining perfectly stable up to K=30 while retaining its SOTA performance across all graph types. This work identifies a critical architectural pitfall in hybrid GNN design and provides the robust architectural solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faHybSpecNet\u6df7\u5408\u57dfGNN\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684ChebyNet\u5206\u652f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684KrawtchoukNet\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\"\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027vs\u9002\u5e94\u6027\"\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\"\u5ef6\u8fdf\u878d\u5408\"\u67b6\u6784\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u9762\u4e34\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1aChebyNet\u5728[-1,1]\u57df\u7a33\u5b9a\u4f46\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u914d\u56fe\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1bKrawtchoukNet\u5728[0,\u221e)\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u4f46\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u9ad8\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5ea6\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6df7\u5408\u57dfGNN\u67b6\u6784HybSpecNet\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5206\u652f(ChebyNet)\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u652f(KrawtchoukNet)\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u62fc\u63a5\u878d\u5408\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\"\u5ef6\u8fdf\u878d\u5408\"\u67b6\u6784\u5b8c\u5168\u9694\u79bb\u68af\u5ea6\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u7b80\u5355\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u4f4eK\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728K=25\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u5728K=30\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5b8c\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u6240\u6709\u56fe\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u6df7\u5408GNN\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u67b6\u6784\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8c31\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Specifically, we construct positive-incentive noise in the feature space via cross-attention fusion of visual and categorical semantic features. During optimization, the noise is injected into the feature space to fine-tune the visual encoder, suppressing shortcut-sensitive directions while amplifying stable forensic cues, thereby enabling the extraction of more robust and generalized artifact representations.

To address these limitations, we propose a pretrained Degradation Representation Learning (DRL) module that decouples and extracts high-dimensional, multiscale degradation representations from video content to guide the artifact removal. Additionally, both blind and non-blind methods typically employ uniform architectures across QPs, hence, overlooking the varying computational demands inherent to different compression levels. We thus introduce a hierarchical termination mechanism that dynamically adjusts the number of artifact reduction stages based on the compression level. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances performance, achieving a PSNR improvement of 110% (from 0.31 dB to 0.65 dB) over a competing state-of-the-art blind method at QP = 22. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchical termination mechanism reduces the average inference time at QP = 22 by half compared to QP = 42.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u76f2\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u91cf\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u53ef\u80fd\u672a\u77e5\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u76f2\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u6355\u83b7\u5168\u5c40\u9000\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u540c\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u9000\u5316\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u4f2a\u5f71\u53bb\u9664\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u6839\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7ea7\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u8ba1\u7b97\u9636\u6bb5\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728QP=22\u65f6PSNR\u4ece0.31dB\u63d0\u5347\u52300.65dB\uff08\u63d0\u5347110%\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u7ec8\u6b62\u673a\u5236\u5728QP=22\u65f6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u6bd4QP=42\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u534a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76f2\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Consequently, current research predominantly focuses on Unsupervised Time-series Anomaly Detection (UTAD), relying on complex architectures to model normal data distributions.

This paper challenges the premise that architectural complexity is the optimal path for TSAD. We conduct the first methodical comparison between supervised and unsupervised paradigms and introduce STAND, a streamlined supervised baseline. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that: (1) Labels matter more than models: under a limited labeling budget, simple supervised models significantly outperform complex state-of-the-art unsupervised methods; (2) Supervision yields higher returns: the performance gain from minimal supervision far exceeds that from architectural innovations; and (3) Practicality: STAND exhibits superior prediction consistency and anomaly localization compared to unsupervised counterparts.

Recently, the scarcity of high spatial resolution datasets for WBCD restricts its application in urban and rural regions, which require more accurate positioning. Meanwhile, previous deep learning-based methods fail to comprehensively exploit the spatial semantic and structural information in deep features in the change detection networks. To resolve these concerns, we first propose a new dataset, HSRW-CD, with a spatial resolution higher than 3 meters for WBCD. Specifically, it contains a large number of image pairs, widely covering various water body types. Besides, a Spatial Semantics and Continuity Perception (SSCP) attention module is designed to fully leverage both the spatial semantics and structure of deep features in the WBCD networks, significantly improving the discrimination capability for water body. The proposed SSCP has three components: the Multi-Semantic spatial Attention (MSA), the Structural Relation-aware Global Attention (SRGA), and the Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA). The MSA enhances the spatial semantics of water body features and provides precise spatial semantic priors for the CSA. Then, the SRGA further extracts spatial structure to learn the spatial continuity of the water body. Finally, the CSA utilizes the spatial semantic and structural priors from the MSA and SRGA to compute the similarity across channels. Specifically designed as a plug-and-play module for water body deep features, the proposed SSCP allows integration into existing WBCD models. Numerous experiments conducted on the proposed HSRW-CD and Water-CD datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of the SSCP.

While recent studies show that Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can serve as strong embedding extractors, existing approaches treat embedding extraction as a direct encoding step, overlooking the fact that MLLMs possess the generative capability for reasoning that could be leveraged to enhance representation quality. In this work, we explore how to explicitly incorporate reasoning into the embedding process. To this end, we propose Reasoning Guided Embeddings (RGE), which preserves the generative rationale process of MLLMs and couples it with contrastive training.

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\\% degradation in key objective metrics.

Drawing inspiration from human perception mechanisms, existing studies attempt to construct a coherent spatial understanding via grid-based cognitive maps from multi-frame visual inputs. However, current grid-based map methods rely on discretized raster representations, which limit the model's ability in fine-grained spatial reasoning. To overcome this limitation, we propose Video2Layout, a framework for reconstructing metric-grounded spatial layouts from video. The framework employs continuous object boundary coordinates to quantify inter-object physical distances and object size. This empowers the model with quantitative spatial computation capabilities, effectively alleviating the inherent ambiguity when describing spatial relationships in natural language. Specifically, our method comprises two core stages. First, in supervised fine-tuning stage, we construct a high-quality dataset from the AI2THOR simulator, which enables the model to learn the mapping from visual inputs to precise boundary coordinates. Subsequently, a reinforcement fine-tuning stage further enhances the model's real-world generalization capabilities. To systematically evaluate the correlation between cognitive map accuracy and image quantity, as well as how the quantity of image inputs affects spatial reasoning accuracy, we introduce QVS-Bench, a diagnostic benchmark designed to analyze the relevant mechanisms. Evaluated on QVS-Bench and mainstream spatial reasoning benchmarks, our model, V2LO-7B achieves an average improvement of 4.92% over the model trained on grid maps, validating the superiority of our method.

In the absence of such data, these models are prone to poor generalisation and may fail to perform reliably in real-world scenarios. %\nRecent advances in Causal Generative Models (CGMs) offer a promising solution. CGMs enable the generation of synthetic datasets that preserve the underlying causal relationships within the data, providing greater control over fairness and interpretability in the data generation process. %\nIn this study, we present a specialised SDG method involving two CGMs: one modelling job offers and the other modelling curricula. Each model is structured according to a causal graph informed by domain expertise. We use these models to generate synthetic datasets and evaluate the fairness of candidate rankings under controlled scenarios that introduce specific biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08CGMs\uff09\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u62db\u8058\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u62db\u8058\u9886\u57df\u7531\u4e8e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5efa\u6a21\u804c\u4f4d\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5efa\u6a21\u7b80\u5386\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e76\u5728\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5b9a\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u4eba\u6392\u540d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u5e95\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6392\u540d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u62db\u8058\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

A persistent challenge in this field is simultaneously preserving fine-grained details present in the input while ensuring the global structural integrity of the completed shape. While recent works leveraging local symmetry transformations via direct regression have significantly improved the preservation of geometric structure details, these methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) These regression-based methods are prone to overfitting which tend to memorize instant-specific transformations instead of learning a generalizable geometric prior. (2) Their reliance on point-wise transformation regression lead to high sensitivity to input noise, severely degrading their robustness and generalization. To address these challenges, we introduce Simba, a novel framework that reformulates point-wise transformation regression as a distribution learning problem. Our approach integrates symmetry priors with the powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models, avoiding instance-specific memorization while capturing robust geometric structures. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical Mamba-based architecture to achieve high-fidelity upsampling.

By learning the underlying probability distribution of the training dataset, deep generative models, such as the diffusion model (DM), can generate high-fidelity synthetic samples that statistically resemble the training data. Such synthetic data generation can significantly enrich the size and diversity of the available training data, and more importantly, improve the robustness of downstream machine learning models in predictive tasks. The objective of this paper is to investigate the effectiveness of DM for overcoming data scarcity in nuclear energy applications. By leveraging a public dataset on critical heat flux (CHF) that cover a wide range of commercial nuclear reactor operational conditions, we developed a DM that can generate an arbitrary amount of synthetic samples for augmenting of the CHF dataset. Since a vanilla DM can only generate samples randomly, we also developed a conditional DM capable of generating targeted CHF data under user-specified thermal-hydraulic conditions. The performance of the DM was evaluated based on their ability to capture empirical feature distributions and pair-wise correlations, as well as to maintain physical consistency. The results showed that both the DM and conditional DM can successfully generate realistic and physics-consistent CHF data. Furthermore, uncertainty quantification was performed to establish confidence in the generated data. The results demonstrated that the conditional DM is highly effective in augmenting CHF data while maintaining acceptable levels of uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u514b\u670d\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u6838\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u5f80\u5f80\u6709\u9650\u3001\u6602\u8d35\u6216\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u524d\u8005\u968f\u673a\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u70ed\u5de5\u6c34\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\u6355\u6349\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7279\u5f81\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u3002\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u514b\u670d\u6838\u80fd\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The mainstream solution is adversarial training (AT) to improve robustness; however, AT often brings a clean--robustness trade-off and high training/tuning cost, which limits scalability and maintainability in medical imaging. We propose \\emph{Layer-wise Noise-Guided Selective Wavelet Reconstruction (LNG-SWR)}. During training, we inject small, zero-mean noise at multiple layers to learn a frequency-bias prior that steers representations away from noise-sensitive directions. We then apply prior-guided selective wavelet reconstruction on the input/feature branch to achieve frequency adaptation: suppress noise-sensitive bands, enhance directional structures and shape cues, and stabilize boundary responses while maintaining spectral consistency. The framework is backbone-agnostic and adds low additional inference overhead. It can serve as a plug-in enhancement to AT and also improves robustness without AT. On CT and ultrasound datasets, under a unified protocol with PGD-$L_{\\infty}/L_{2}$ and SSAH, LNG-SWR delivers consistent gains on clean Dice/IoU and significantly reduces the performance drop under strong attacks; combining LNG-SWR with AT yields additive gains. When combined with adversarial training, robustness improves further without sacrificing clean accuracy, indicating an engineering-friendly and scalable path to robust segmentation.

Labeled datasets for crop-type classification are inherently scarce and remain costly to obtain. When working with such limited data, training sets are frequently constructed to be artificially balanced -- in particular in the case of few-shot learning -- failing to reflect real-world conditions. This mismatch induces a shift between training and test label distributions, degrading real-world generalization. To address this, we propose Dirichlet Prior Augmentation (DirPA), a novel method that simulates an unknown label distribution skew of the target domain proactively during model training.

In particular, the number of tokens consumed during the generation process has emerged as a key evaluation metric.Prior studies have shown that specific inputs can induce VLMs to generate lengthy outputs with low information density, which significantly increases energy consumption, latency, and token costs. However, existing methods simply delay the occurrence of the EOS token to implicitly prolong output, and fail to directly maximize the output token length as an explicit optimization objective, lacking stability and controllability.To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel verbose-text induction attack (VTIA) to inject imperceptible adversarial perturbations into benign images via a two-stage framework, which identifies the most malicious prompt embeddings for optimizing and maximizing the output token of the perturbed images.Specifically, we first perform adversarial prompt search, employing reinforcement learning strategies to automatically identify adversarial prompts capable of inducing the LLM component within VLMs to produce verbose outputs. We then conduct vision-aligned perturbation optimization to craft adversarial examples on input images, maximizing the similarity between the perturbed image's visual embeddings and those of the adversarial prompt, thereby constructing malicious images that trigger verbose text generation. Comprehensive experiments on four popular VLMs demonstrate that our method achieves significant advantages in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and generalization capability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5197\u957f\u6587\u672c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb(VTIA)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u5bdf\u89c9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u6ce8\u5165\u826f\u6027\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5ef6\u8fdfEOS\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u5ef6\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u8bf1\u5bfcLLM\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6270\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5236\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u56fe\u50cf\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6d41\u884cVLM\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "VTIA\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u8bf1\u5bfcVLMs\u4ea7\u751f\u5197\u957f\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3VLMs\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We present EvoVLA, a self-supervised VLA framework that addresses this issue through three complementary components: Stage-Aligned Reward (SAR), which uses triplet contrastive learning with Gemini-generated hard negatives to prevent visual shortcuts; Pose-Based Object Exploration (POE), which grounds curiosity in relative object-gripper pose instead of raw pixels; and Long-Horizon Memory, which uses selective context retention and gated fusion to stabilize intrinsic shaping during extended rollouts. Extensive evaluations on Discoverse-L, a long-horizon manipulation benchmark with three multi-stage tasks, show that EvoVLA improves average task success by 10.2 percentage points over the strongest baseline (OpenVLA-OFT), reaching 69.2 percent. EvoVLA also achieves one-and-a-half times better sample efficiency and reduces stage hallucination from 38.5 percent to 14.8 percent. Real-world deployment on physical robots reaches an average success rate of 54.6 percent across four manipulation tasks, outperforming OpenVLA-OFT by 11 points, demonstrating effective sim-to-real transfer and strong generalization.

In the literature, the successive over-relaxation Q-learning algorithm has been developed and implemented, and it is seen to result in a lower contraction factor for the associated Q-Bellman operator resulting in a faster value iteration-based procedure. However, this has been presented only for the tabular case and not for the setting with function approximation that typically caters to real-world high-dimensional state-action spaces. Furthermore, such settings in the case of two-player zero-sum games have not been considered. We thus propose a deep successive over-relaxation minimax Q-learning algorithm that incorporates deep neural networks as function approximators and is suitable for high-dimensional spaces. We prove the finite-time convergence of the proposed algorithm. Through numerical experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed method over the existing Q-learning algorithm.

A key challenge is enhancing the multimodal dense prediction capability, specifically this pixel-level multimodal alignment. Although existing methods achieve promising results by leveraging CLIP's vision-language alignment, they rarely investigate the performance boundaries of CLIP for dense prediction from an interpretability mechanisms perspective. In this work, we systematically investigate CLIP's internal mechanisms and identify a critical phenomenon: analogous to human distraction, CLIP diverts significant attention resources from target regions to irrelevant tokens. Our analysis reveals that these tokens arise from dimension-specific over-activation; filtering them enhances CLIP's dense prediction performance. Consequently, we propose ReFocusing CLIP (RF-CLIP), a training-free approach that emulates human distraction-refocusing behavior to redirect attention from distraction tokens back to target regions, thereby refining CLIP's multimodal alignment granularity.

To evaluate and enhance this capability, the pass@k metric, which measures the probability of obtaining at least one correct solution in k independent samples, has received significant attention. Its intuitive appeal has led to its adoption not only as an evaluation standard but also as a direct optimization objective in reinforcement learning. In this paper, we analyze the pass@k objective, derive its gradient, and demonstrate that it is fundamentally a per-example positive reweighting of the simpler pass@1 objective. Our analysis reveals that the pass@k objective provides a vanishing learning signal in regimes where exploration is most critical. We further analyze the dynamics of \"exploration collapse\", showing that as the policy concentrates probability mass, the gap between pass@k and pass@1 diminishes. We conclude that while pass@k is a useful diagnostic tool, it may be an unsuitable direct objective for optimization.

However, letting VLA directly predict high-dimensional visual states can distribute model capacity and incur prohibitive training cost, while compressing visual states into more compact supervisory signals inevitably incurs information bottlenecks. Moreover, existing methods often suffer from poor comprehension and reasoning capabilities due to the neglect of language supervision. This paper introduces Mantis, a novel framework featuring a Disentangled Visual Foresight (DVF) to tackle these issues. Specifically, Mantis decouples visual foresight prediction from the backbone with the combination of meta queries and a diffusion Transformer (DiT) head. With the current visual state provided to the DiT via a residual connection, a simple next-state prediction objective enables the meta queries to automatically capture the latent actions that delineate the visual trajectory, and hence boost the learning of explicit actions. The disentanglement reduces the burden of the VLA backbone, enabling it to maintain comprehension and reasoning capabilities through language supervision. Empirically, pretrained on human manipulation videos, robot demonstrations, and image-text pairs, Mantis achieves a 96.7% success rate on LIBERO benchmark after fine-tuning, surpassing powerful baselines while exhibiting high convergence speed. Real-world evaluations show that Mantis outperforms $\u03c0_{0.5}$, a leading open-source VLA model, particularly in instruction-following capability, generalization to unseen instructions, and reasoning ability.

GeoPTH constructs data-dependent hash functions by using representative trajectory prototypes, i.e., small point sets preserving geometric characteristics, as anchors. The hashing process is efficient, which involves mapping a new trajectory to its closest prototype via a robust, \\textit{Hausdorff} metric. Extensive experiments show that GeoPTH's retrieval accuracy is highly competitive with both traditional metrics and state-of-the-art learning methods, and it significantly outperforms binary codes generated through simple binarization of the learned embeddings.

However, due to the discrepancies between public datasets and real-world data, most existing VI-ReID algorithms struggle in real-life applications. To address this, we take the initiative to investigate Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Visible-Infrared person Re-Identification (UDA-VI-ReID), aiming to transfer the knowledge learned from the public data to real-world data without compromising accuracy and requiring the annotation of new samples. Specifically, we first analyze two basic challenges in UDA-VI-ReID, i.e., inter-domain modality discrepancies and intra-domain modality discrepancies. Then, we design a novel two-stage model, i.e., Domain-Shared Learning and Gradual Alignment (DSLGA), to handle these discrepancies. In the first pre-training stage, DSLGA introduces a Domain-Shared Learning Strategy (DSLS) to mitigate ineffective pre-training caused by inter-domain modality discrepancies via exploiting shared information between the source and target domains. While, in the second fine-tuning stage, DSLGA designs a Gradual Alignment Strategy (GAS) to handle the cross-modality alignment challenges between visible and infrared data caused by the large intra-domain modality discrepancies through a cluster-to-holistic alignment way. Finally, a new UDA-VI-ReID testing method i.e., CMDA-XD, is constructed for training and testing different UDA-VI-ReID models.

The problem of optimal operation can be tackled with reinforcement learning, but traditional reinforcement learning methods face challenges due to hard constraints related to quality and safety that must be strictly satisfied, and the large amount of required training data. Chemical processes often cannot provide sufficient experimental data, and while detailed dynamic models can be an alternative, their complexity makes it computationally intractable to generate the needed data. Optimal control methods, such as model predictive control, also struggle with the complexity of the underlying dynamic models. Consequently, many chemical processes rely on manually defined operation recipes combined with simple linear controllers, leading to suboptimal performance and limited flexibility.\n  In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages expert knowledge embedded in operation recipes. By using reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of these recipes and their underlying linear controllers, we achieve an optimized operation recipe. This method requires significantly less data, handles constraints more effectively, and is more interpretable than traditional reinforcement learning methods due to the structured nature of the recipes. We demonstrate the potential of our approach through simulation results of an industrial batch polymerization reactor, showing that it can approach the performance of optimal controllers while addressing the limitations of existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u96be\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u5bf9\u8282\u80fd\u51cf\u6392\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u91cf\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u8be6\u7ec6\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u53c8\u8fc7\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u6b21\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u914d\u65b9\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u5e95\u5c42\u7ebf\u6027\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u914d\u65b9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5c11\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u6279\u91cf\u805a\u5408\u53cd\u5e94\u5668\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u4e13\u5bb6\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u5316\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Despite their impressive capabilities, the adversarial robustness of these systems remains largely unexplored, especially under realistic multimodal and black-box conditions.

In this paper, we introduce VLA-Fool, a comprehensive study of multimodal adversarial robustness in embodied VLA models under both white-box and black-box settings. VLA-Fool unifies three levels of multimodal adversarial attacks: (1) textual perturbations through gradient-based and prompt-based manipulations, (2) visual perturbations via patch and noise distortions, and (3) cross-modal misalignment attacks that intentionally disrupt the semantic correspondence between perception and instruction. We further incorporate a VLA-aware semantic space into linguistic prompts, developing the first automatically crafted and semantically guided prompting framework.

Rather than relying solely on nominal models, the proposed framework treats the system matrices as optimizable variables and refines them through gradient-based minimization of a steady-state output discrepancy loss. The resulting data-informed surrogate model enables the construction of an improved observer that effectively compensates for moderate parameter uncertainty while preserving the structure of classical designs. Extensive Monte Carlo studies across diverse system dimensions show systematic and statistically significant reductions, typically exceeding 15\\%, in normalized estimation error for both open-loop and Luenberger observers. These results demonstrate that modern learning mechanisms can serve as a powerful complement to traditional observer design, yielding more accurate and robust state estimation in uncertain systems.

Early methods integrated representation learning and clustering within an iterative framework. However, the rise of foundational models have recently shifted focus solely to clustering, bypassing the representation learning step. In this work, we build upon a recent multi-head clustering approach by introducing adaptive nearest neighbor selection and cluster ensembling strategies to improve clustering performance. Our method, \"Image Clustering through Cluster Ensembles\" (ICCE), begins with a clustering stage, where we train multiple clustering heads on a frozen backbone, producing diverse image clusterings. We then employ a cluster ensembling technique to consolidate these potentially conflicting results into a unified consensus clustering. Finally, we train an image classifier using the consensus clustering result as pseudo-labels. ICCE achieves state-of-the-art performance on ten image classification benchmarks, achieving 99.3% accuracy on CIFAR10, 89% on CIFAR100, and 70.4% on ImageNet datasets, narrowing the performance gap with supervised methods.

However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration.

A Multimodal Benchmark for Assessing Deception in Multi-Party Social Interactions", "comment": null, "summary": "Despite their advanced reasoning capabilities, state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrably lack a core component of human intelligence: the ability to `read the room' and assess deception in complex social interactions. To rigorously quantify this failure, we introduce a new task, Multimodal Interactive Deception Assessment (MIDA), and present a novel multimodal dataset providing synchronized video and text with verifiable ground-truth labels for every statement. We establish a comprehensive benchmark evaluating 12 state-of-the-art open- and closed-source MLLMs, revealing a significant performance gap: even powerful models like GPT-4o struggle to distinguish truth from falsehood reliably. Our analysis of failure modes indicates that these models fail to effectively ground language in multimodal social cues and lack the ability to model what others know, believe, or intend, highlighting the urgent need for novel approaches to building more perceptive and trustworthy AI systems. To take a step forward, we design a Social Chain-of-Thought (SoCoT) reasoning pipeline and a Dynamic Social Epistemic Memory (DSEM) module.

Existing methods typically connect parallel RGB and NIR branches to a shared backbone, which limits the comprehensive extraction of distinctive modality-specific features and fails to address the issue of object drift, especially in the presence of unreliable inputs. In this paper, we propose SwiTrack, a novel state-switching framework that redefines CMOT through the deployment of three specialized streams. Specifically, RGB frames are processed by the visual encoder, while NIR frames undergo refinement via a NIR gated adapter coupled with the visual encoder to progressively calibrate shared latent space features, thereby yielding more robust cross-modal representations. For invalid modalities, a consistency trajectory prediction module leverages spatio-temporal cues to estimate target movement, ensuring robust tracking and mitigating drift. Additionally, we incorporate dynamic template reconstruction to iteratively update template features and employ a similarity alignment loss to reinforce feature consistency. Experimental results on the latest benchmarks demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art performance, boosting precision rate and success rate gains by 7.2\\% and 4.3\\%, respectively, while maintaining real-time tracking at 65 frames per second.

Existing systems primarily track head and hands via Head Mounted Devices (HMDs) and controllers, making the 3D full-body reconstruction in-complete. One potential approach is to generate the full-body motions from sparse inputs collected from limited sensors using a Neural Network (NN) model. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) backbone that is enhanced with residual connections and a novel NN-component called Memory-Block. In particular, Memory-Block represents missing sensor data with trainable code-vectors, which are combined with the sparse signals from previous time instances to improve the temporal consistency. Furthermore, we formulate our solution as a multi-task learning problem, allowing our MLP-backbone to learn robust representations that boost accuracy. Our experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by substantially reducing prediction errors. Moreover, it achieves 72 FPS on mobile HMDs that ultimately improves the accuracy-running time tradeoff.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u548cMemory-Block\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u3001\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5728AR/VR\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AR/VR\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5934\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5934\u90e8\u548c\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f43D\u5168\u8eab\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6709\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u673a\uff08MLP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165Memory-Block\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7528\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7801\u5411\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u7f3a\u5931\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5386\u53f2\u7a00\u758f\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5b66\u4e60\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u5934\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523072 FPS\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Memory-Block\u589e\u5f3aMLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3AR/VR\u4e2d\u5168\u8eab\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We first derive a closed-form optimal mechanism for binary sensitive attributes and then develop a tractable optimization framework that yields the corresponding optimal mechanism for multi-valued attributes. As a theoretical contribution, we establish that for discrimination-accuracy optimal classifiers, reducing data unfairness necessarily leads to lower classification unfairness, thus providing a direct link between privacy-aware pre-processing and classification fairness. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing LDP mechanisms in reducing data unfairness across diverse datasets and fairness metrics, while maintaining accuracy close to that of non-private models. Moreover, compared with leading pre-processing and post-processing fairness methods, our mechanism achieves a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off while simultaneously preserving the privacy of sensitive attributes.

Yet, most health sensing studies focus narrowly on physical chronic diseases. This overlooks the critical need for joint assessment of comorbid physical chronic diseases and depression, which is essential for collaborative chronic care. We conceptualize multi-disease assessment, including both physical diseases and depression, as a multi-task learning (MTL) problem, where each disease assessment is modeled as a task. This joint formulation leverages inter-disease relationships to improve accuracy, but it also introduces the challenge of double heterogeneity: chronic diseases differ in their manifestation (disease heterogeneity), and patients with the same disease show varied patterns (patient heterogeneity). To address these issues, we first adopt existing techniques and propose a base method. Given the limitations of the base method, we further propose an Advanced Double Heterogeneity-based Multi-Task Learning (ADH-MTL) method that improves the base method through three innovations: (1) group-level modeling to support new patient predictions, (2) a decomposition strategy to reduce model complexity, and (3) a Bayesian network that explicitly captures dependencies while balancing similarities and differences across model components. Empirical evaluations on real-world wearable sensor data demonstrate that ADH-MTL significantly outperforms existing baselines, and each of its innovations is shown to be effective.

While recent generative models based on denoising diffusion have advanced state-of-the-art performance in capturing complex data distributions, they suffer from significant computational overhead due to iterative stochastic sampling procedures that limit real-time deployment. Moreover, these models can be brittle when handling high-dimensional, non-stationary, and multi-scale periodic patterns characteristic of real-world sensor networks. We introduce FreqFlow, a novel framework that leverages conditional flow matching in the frequency domain for deterministic MTS forecasting. Unlike conventional approaches that operate in the time domain, FreqFlow transforms the forecasting problem into the spectral domain, where it learns to model amplitude and phase shifts through a single complex-valued linear layer. This frequency-domain formulation enables the model to efficiently capture temporal dynamics via complex multiplication, corresponding to scaling and temporal translations. The resulting architecture is exceptionally lightweight with only 89k parameters - an order of magnitude smaller than competing diffusion-based models-while enabling single-pass deterministic sampling through ordinary differential equation (ODE) integration. Our approach decomposes MTS signals into trend, seasonal, and residual components, with the flow matching mechanism specifically designed for residual learning to enhance long-term forecasting accuracy.

A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based augmentation method was imposed to balance class distributions and better generalize the model. Further, a self-supervised contrastive pre-training method helps to learn more features from limited annotated data.

However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients.

Motivated by this, and considering various benefits of mobile device deployment (data privacy, operating without internet connectivity, and potentially faster responses), this paper develops Texture3dgs, an optimized mapping of 3DGS for a mobile GPU. A critical challenge in this area turns out to be optimizing for the two-dimensional (2D) texture cache, which needs to be exploited for faster executions on mobile GPUs. As a sorting method dominates the computations in 3DGS on mobile platforms, the core of Texture3dgs is a novel sorting algorithm where the processing, data movement, and placement are highly optimized for 2D memory. The properties of this algorithm are analyzed in view of a cost model for the texture cache. In addition, we accelerate other steps of the 3DGS algorithm through improved variable layout design and other optimizations. End-to-end evaluation shows that Texture3dgs delivers up to 4.1$\\times$ and 1.7$\\times$ speedup for the sorting and overall 3D scene reconstruction, respectively -- while also reducing memory usage by up to 1.6$\\times$ -- demonstrating the effectiveness of our design for efficient mobile 3D scene reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Texture3dgs\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4f18\u5316\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85(3DGS)\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.1\u500d\u6392\u5e8f\u52a0\u901f\u548c1.7\u500d\u6574\u4f53\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c111.6\u500d\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u5177\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u3001\u79bb\u7ebf\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f463DGS\u5728\u79fb\u52a8GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u4e8c\u7ef4\u7eb9\u7406\u7f13\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u79fb\u52a83D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a2D\u5185\u5b58\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6570\u636e\u79fb\u52a8\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u6765\u5229\u7528\u7eb9\u7406\u7f13\u5b58\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u53d8\u91cf\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u52a0\u901f3DGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cTexture3dgs\u5728\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e864.1\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6574\u4f533D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e861.7\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.6\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u65483D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u7aef3D\u91cd\u5efa\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While traditional offline RL algorithms like Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) and Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) have shown promise, they often face challenges in balancing exploration and exploitation, especially in environments with varying reward densities. The recently proposed Decision Transformer (DT) approach, which reframes offline RL as a sequence modelling problem, has demonstrated impressive results across various benchmarks. This paper presents a comparative study evaluating the performance of DT against traditional offline RL algorithms in dense and sparse reward settings for the ANT continous control environment. Our research investigates how these algorithms perform when faced with different reward structures, examining their ability to learn effective policies and generalize across varying levels of feedback. Through empirical analysis in the ANT environment, we found that DTs showed less sensitivity to varying reward density compared to other methods and particularly excelled with medium-expert datasets in sparse reward scenarios. In contrast, traditional value-based methods like IQL showed improved performance in dense reward settings with high-quality data, while CQL offered balanced performance across different data qualities. Additionally, DTs exhibited lower variance in performance but required significantly more computational resources compared to traditional approaches. These findings suggest that sequence modelling approaches may be more suitable for scenarios with uncertain reward structures or mixed-quality data, while value-based methods remain competitive in settings with dense rewards and high-quality demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08DT\uff09\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728ANT\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7a20\u5bc6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u9884\u6536\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5e73\u8861\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5c06\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "\u5728ANT\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83DT\u4e0eCQL\u3001IQL\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u7a20\u5bc6vs\u7a00\u758f\uff09\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "DT\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u654f\u611f\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u7b49\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\uff1bIQL\u5728\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1bCQL\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u8861\u3002DT\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u4f4e\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6216\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6df7\u5408\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a20\u5bc6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002"}}

Although Vision Foundation Models demonstrate strong generalization across diverse downstream tasks, their representations are typically downsampled by 14x/16x (e.g., ViT), which limits their direct use in pixel-level applications. Existing feature upsampling approaches depend on dataset-specific retraining or heavy implicit optimization, restricting scalability and generalization. Upsample Anything addresses these issues through a simple per-image optimization that learns an anisotropic Gaussian kernel combining spatial and range cues, effectively bridging Gaussian Splatting and Joint Bilateral Upsampling. The learned kernel acts as a universal, edge-aware operator that transfers seamlessly across architectures and modalities, enabling precise high-resolution reconstruction of features, depth, or probability maps. It runs in only $\\approx0.419 \\text{s}$ per 224x224 image and achieves state-of-the-art performance on semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and both depth and probability map upsampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Upsample Anything\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5c06\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Vision Foundation Models\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u9650\u5236\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982ViT\uff09\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u4e0b\u91c7\u683714x/16x\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u6bcf\u56fe\u50cf\u4f18\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8303\u56f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u6838\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6865\u63a5\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u548c\u8054\u5408\u53cc\u8fb9\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6838\u4f5c\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u8fb9\u7f18\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u65e0\u7f1d\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728224x224\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u4ec5\u9700\u7ea60.419\u79d2\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u6982\u7387\u56fe\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Upsample Anything\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, these functions often struggle to approximate the Pareto front accurately, rendering them unideal in complex, uncertain environments. This study examines selected Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms across MORL environments with discrete action and observation spaces. We aim to investigate further the limitations associated with scalarisation approaches for decision-making in multi-objective settings. Specifically, we use an outer-loop multi-policy methodology to assess the performance of a seminal single-policy MORL algorithm, MO Q-Learning implemented with linear scalarisation and Chebyshev scalarisation functions. In addition, we explore a pioneering inner-loop multi-policy algorithm, Pareto Q-Learning, which offers a more robust alternative. Our findings reveal that the performance of the scalarisation functions is highly dependent on the environment and the shape of the Pareto front. These functions often fail to retain the solutions uncovered during learning and favour finding solutions in certain regions of the solution space. Moreover, finding the appropriate weight configurations to sample the entire Pareto front is complex, limiting their applicability in uncertain settings. In contrast, inner-loop multi-policy algorithms may provide a more sustainable and generalizable approach and potentially facilitate intelligent decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08MORL\uff09\u4e2d\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u903c\u8fd1\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u5f62\u72b6\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u5728MORL\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u903c\u8fd1\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5916\u5faa\u73af\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc4\u4f30MO Q-Learning\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5207\u6bd4\u96ea\u592b\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u7b97\u6cd5Pareto Q-Learning\u3002", "result": "\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u7559\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u89e3\uff0c\u4e14\u504f\u5411\u4e8e\u5728\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u5bfb\u627e\u89e3\u3002\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u91c7\u6837\u6574\u4e2a\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u5f88\u590d\u6742\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5185\u5faa\u73af\u591a\u7b56\u7565\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

We propose a new perspective on SAEs by demonstrating that they can be naturally understood as topic models. We extend Latent Dirichlet Allocation to embedding spaces and derive the SAE objective as a maximum a posteriori estimator under this model. This view implies SAE features are thematic components rather than steerable directions. Based on this, we introduce SAE-TM, a topic modeling framework that: (1) trains an SAE to learn reusable topic atoms, (2) interprets them as word distributions on downstream data, and (3) merges them into any number of topics without retraining. SAE-TM yields more coherent topics than strong baselines on text and image datasets while maintaining diversity. Finally, we analyze thematic structure in image datasets and trace topic changes over time in Japanese woodblock prints.

Existing global attribution methods often incur high computational costs, lack stability under correlated inputs, and fail to scale efficiently to large or heterogeneous datasets. We address these gaps with \\emph{ExCIR} (Explainability through Correlation Impact Ratio), a correlation-aware attribution score equipped with a lightweight transfer protocol that reproduces full-model rankings using only a fraction of the data. ExCIR quantifies sign-aligned co-movement between features and model outputs after \\emph{robust centering} (subtracting a robust location estimate, e.g., median or mid-mean, from features and outputs). We further introduce \\textsc{BlockCIR}, a \\emph{groupwise} extension of ExCIR that scores \\emph{sets} of correlated features as a single unit.

In contrast to previous approaches that rely on baking 2D multi-view images synthesized by geometry-conditioned Multi-View Diffusion models (MVDs), NaTex avoids several inherent limitations of the MVD pipeline. These include difficulties in handling occluded regions that require inpainting, achieving precise mesh-texture alignment along boundaries, and maintaining cross-view consistency and coherence in both content and color intensity. NaTex features a novel paradigm that addresses the aforementioned issues by viewing texture as a dense color point cloud. Driven by this idea, we propose latent color diffusion, which comprises a geometry-awared color point cloud VAE and a multi-control diffusion transformer (DiT), entirely trained from scratch using 3D data, for texture reconstruction and generation. To enable precise alignment, we introduce native geometry control that conditions the DiT on direct 3D spatial information via positional embeddings and geometry latents. We co-design the VAE-DiT architecture, where the geometry latents are extracted via a dedicated geometry branch tightly coupled with the color VAE, providing fine-grained surface guidance that maintains strong correspondence with the texture. With these designs, NaTex demonstrates strong performance, significantly outperforming previous methods in texture coherence and alignment.

However, these models demand substantial computational resources and storage, and their growing complexity limits our understanding of how they make decisions. Most of these architectures rely on the attention mechanism within Transformer-based designs. Building upon the connection between residual neural networks and ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce ODE-ViT, a Vision Transformer reformulated as an ODE system that satisfies the conditions for well-posed and stable dynamics. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 demonstrate that ODE-ViT achieves stable, interpretable, and competitive performance with up to one order of magnitude fewer parameters, surpassing prior ODE-based Transformer approaches in classification tasks. We further propose a plug-and-play teacher-student framework in which a discrete ViT guides the continuous trajectory of ODE-ViT by treating the intermediate representations of the teacher as solutions of the ODE. This strategy improves performance by more than 10% compared to training a free ODE-ViT from scratch.", "AI": {"tldr": "ODE-ViT\u5c06Vision Transformer\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\u7684ODE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u53d7\u6b8b\u5dee\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e0e\u5e38\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u8054\u7cfb\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06Vision Transformer\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3aODE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a8\u6001\uff1b2. \u5728CIFAR-10\u548cCIFAR-100\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u79bb\u6563ViT\u6307\u5bfcODE-ViT\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u89c6\u4e3aODE\u7684\u89e3\u3002", "result": "ODE-ViT\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u5148\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eODE\u7684Transformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3ODE-ViT\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc710%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ODE-ViT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e0eODE\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Recent hybrid approaches, which couple domain priors with modern deep neural architectures, have achieved strong performance but incur high computational cost, limiting their practicality in real-time scenarios. In this work, we propose WWE-UIE, a compact and efficient enhancement network that integrates three interpretable priors. First, adaptive white balance alleviates the strong wavelength-dependent color attenuation, particularly the dominance of blue-green tones. Second, a wavelet-based enhancement block (WEB) performs multi-band decomposition, enabling the network to capture both global structures and fine textures, which are critical for underwater restoration. Third, a gradient-aware module (SGFB) leverages Sobel operators with learnable gating to explicitly preserve edge structures degraded by scattering. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that WWE-UIE achieves competitive restoration quality with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs, enabling real-time inference on resource-limited platforms.

However, many deep learning-based RSCD methods rely solely on change-map annotations and underuse the semantic information in non-changing regions, which limits robustness under illumination variation, off-nadir views, and scarce labels. This article introduces ChangeDINO, an end-to-end multiscale Siamese framework for optical building change detection. The model fuses a lightweight backbone stream with features transferred from a frozen DINOv3, yielding semantic- and context-rich pyramids even on small datasets. A spatial-spectral differential transformer decoder then exploits multi-scale absolute differences as change priors to highlight true building changes and suppress irrelevant responses.

First, ARASFSR employs 2D deep features, local relative coordinates, and up-sampling scale ratios to predict RGB values for each target pixel, allowing super-resolution at any up-sampling scale. Second, a local frequency estimation module captures high-frequency facial texture information to reduce the spectral bias effect. Lastly, a global coordinate modulation module guides FSR to leverage prior facial structure knowledge and achieve resolution adaptation effectively.

In this work, we present the first open-source framework explicitly designed for benchmarking FL models under dynamic client participation. Our framework provides configurable data distributions, participation patterns, and evaluation metrics tailored to DPFL scenarios. Using this platform, we benchmark four major categories of widely adopted FL models and uncover substantial performance degradation under dynamic participation. To address these challenges, we further propose Knowledge-Pool Federated Learning (KPFL), a generic plugin that maintains a shared knowledge pool across both active and idle clients.

Besides grappling with the complexity of data annotation and ensuring temporal consistency, it also confronts the scarcity of relevant data and the limitations imposed by the effective range of many technologies. This research substantiates that, in aerial positioning tasks, both the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and temporal consistency (TC) metrics are of paramount importance. It is demonstrated that fully labeled data is not the optimal choice, as selecting only key data lacks the enhancement in TC, leading to failures. Hence, a teacher-student architecture, coupled with key frame selection and key frame updating algorithms, is proposed. This framework successfully performs weakly supervised learning and TC knowledge distillation, overcoming the deficiencies of traditional TC training in aerial tasks. The experimental results reveal that our method utilizing merely 30\\% of labeled data, concurrently elevates mIoU and temporal consistency ensuring stable localization of terrain objects.

Although a variety of bias-mitigation methods have been proposed, many rely on computationally expensive debiasing strategies or suffer substantial drops in model accuracy, which limits their practicality in real-world, resource-constrained settings. To address this issue, we propose a fairness-oriented low rank factorization (LRF) framework that leverages singular value decomposition (SVD) to improve DL model fairness. Unlike traditional SVD, which is mainly used for model compression by decomposing and reducing weight matrices, our work shows that SVD can also serve as an effective tool for fairness enhancement. Specifically, we observed that elements in the unitary matrices obtained from SVD contribute unequally to model bias across groups defined by sensitive attributes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a method, named FairLRF, that selectively removes bias-inducing elements from unitary matrices to reduce group disparities, thus enhancing model fairness. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms conventional LRF methods as well as state-of-the-art fairness-enhancing techniques. Additionally, an ablation study examines how major hyper-parameters may influence the performance of processed models.

However, some networks establish their universal approximation property by demonstrating that the iterative errors converge in probability measure rather than the more rigorous norm convergence, which makes the universal approximation property of randomized learning networks highly sensitive to random parameter selection, Broad residual learning system (BRLS), as a member of randomized learning models, also encounters this issue. We theoretically demonstrate the limitation of its universal approximation property, that is, the iterative errors do not satisfy norm convergence if the selection of random parameters is inappropriate and the convergence rate meets certain conditions. To address this issue, we propose the broad stochastic configuration residual learning system (BSCRLS) algorithm, which features a novel supervisory mechanism adaptively constraining the range settings of random parameters on the basis of BRLS framework, Furthermore, we prove the universal approximation theorem of BSCRLS based on the more stringent norm convergence.

However, in real-world scenarios, the acquisition of strictly aligned RGB-D is hindered by inherent hardware limitations (e.g., physically separate RGB-D sensors) and unavoidable calibration drift induced by mechanical vibrations or temperature variations. Consequently, existing approaches often suffer inevitable performance degradation when applied to misaligned real-world scenes. In this paper, we propose the Multi-Order Matching Network (MOMNet), a novel alignment-free framework that adaptively retrieves and selects the most relevant information from misaligned RGB. Specifically, our method begins with a multi-order matching mechanism, which jointly performs zero-order, first-order, and second-order matching to comprehensively identify RGB information consistent with depth across multi-order feature spaces. To effectively integrate the retrieved RGB and depth, we further introduce a multi-order aggregation composed of multiple structure detectors. This strategy uses multi-order priors as prompts to facilitate the selective feature transfer from RGB to depth.

While external control arms built from real-world data have been explored, a promising alternative is the generation of synthetic control arms using generative AI. A central challenge is the generation of time-to-event outcomes, which constitute primary endpoints in oncology and rare disease trials, but are difficult to model under censoring and small sample sizes. Existing generative approaches, largely GAN-based, are data-hungry, unstable, and rely on strong assumptions such as independent censoring. We introduce a variational autoencoder (VAE) that jointly generates mixed-type covariates and survival outcomes within a unified latent variable framework, without assuming independent censoring. Across synthetic and real trial datasets, we evaluate our model in two realistic scenarios: (i) data sharing under privacy constraints, where synthetic controls substitute for original data, and (ii) control-arm augmentation, where synthetic patients mitigate imbalances between treated and control groups. Our method outperforms GAN baselines on fidelity, utility, and privacy metrics, while revealing systematic miscalibration of type I error and power.

This paper proposes a new model, DetailSemNet, for OSV. Unlike previous methods that rely on holistic features for pair comparisons, our approach underscores the significance of fine-grained differences for robust OSV. We propose to match local structures between two signature images, significantly boosting verification accuracy. Furthermore, we observe that without specific architectural modifications, transformer-based backbones might naturally obscure local details, adversely impacting OSV performance. To address this, we introduce a Detail Semantics Integrator, leveraging feature disentanglement and re-entanglement. This integrator is specifically designed to enhance intricate details while simultaneously expanding discriminative semantics, thereby augmenting the efficacy of local structural matching. We evaluate our method against leading benchmarks in offline signature verification. Our model consistently outperforms recent methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with clear margins.

Existing generative oversampling methods such as GANs, VAEs, and diffusion models can improve minority-class performance, but they often struggle with tabular heterogeneity, training stability, and privacy concerns. We propose a family of latent-space, tree-driven diffusion methods for minority oversampling that use conditional flow matching with gradient-boosted trees as the vector-field learner. The models operate in compact latent spaces to preserve tabular structure and reduce computation. We introduce three variants: PCAForest, which uses linear PCA embedding; EmbedForest, which uses a learned nonlinear embedding; and AttentionForest, which uses an attention-augmented embedding. Each method couples a GBT-based flow with a decoder back to the original feature space. Across 11 datasets from healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, AttentionForest achieves the best average minority recall while maintaining competitive precision, calibration, and distributional similarity. PCAForest and EmbedForest reach similar utility with much faster generation, offering favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. Privacy evaluated with nearest-neighbor distance ratio and distance-to-closest-record is comparable to or better than the ForestDiffusion baseline. Ablation studies show that smaller embeddings tend to improve minority recall, while aggressive learning rates harm stability. Overall, latent-space, tree-driven diffusion provides an efficient and privacy-aware approach to high-fidelity tabular data augmentation under severe class imbalance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u6811\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff08PCAForest\u3001EmbedForest\u3001AttentionForest\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8868\u683c\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u8fc7\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982GANs\u3001VAEs\u3001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u5904\u7406\u8868\u683c\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u4e09\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\u5206\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027PCA\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\u5d4c\u5165", "result": "\u572811\u4e2a\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u548c\u5236\u9020\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cAttentionForest\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5e73\u5747\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u53ec\u56de\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002PCAForest\u548cEmbedForest\u5728\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u6548\u679c", "conclusion": "\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u6811\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9690\u79c1\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Most Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based CZSL methods focus on disentangling attributes and objects by leveraging the global semantic representation obtained from the image encoder. However, this representation has limited representational capacity and do not allow for complete disentanglement of the two. To this end, we propose CAMS, which aims to extract semantic features from visual features and perform semantic disentanglement in multidimensional spaces, thereby improving generalization over unseen attribute-object compositions. Specifically, CAMS designs a Gated Cross-Attention that captures fine-grained semantic features from the high-level image encoding blocks of CLIP through a set of latent units, while adaptively suppressing background and other irrelevant information. Subsequently, it conducts Multi-Space Disentanglement to achieve disentanglement of attribute and object semantics. Experiments on three popular benchmarks (MIT-States, UT-Zappos, and C-GQA) demonstrate that CAMS achieves state-of-the-art performance in both closed-world and open-world settings.

Building on the Every Call is Precious (ECP) framework, which ensures that each accepted function evaluation is potentially informative, ECPv2 addresses key limitations of ECP, including high computational cost and overly conservative early behavior. ECPv2 introduces three innovations: (i) an adaptive lower bound to avoid vacuous acceptance regions, (ii) a Worst-m memory mechanism that restricts comparisons to a fixed-size subset of past evaluations, and (iii) a fixed random projection to accelerate distance computations in high dimensions. We theoretically show that ECPv2 retains ECP's no-regret guarantees with optimal finite-time bounds and expands the acceptance region with high probability. We further empirically validate these findings through extensive experiments and ablation studies.

To address this, we introduce a novel fundamental unit for MoCap, the Rigid Body Marker (RBM), which provides unambiguous 6-DoF data and drastically simplifies setup. Leveraging this new data modality, we develop a deep-learning-based regression model that directly estimates SMPL parameters under a geodesic loss. This end-to-end approach matches the performance of optimization-based methods while requiring over an order of magnitude less computation. Trained on synthesized data from the AMASS dataset, our end-to-end model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in body pose estimation. Real-world data captured using a Vicon optical tracking system further demonstrates the practical viability of our approach.

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of its long-run behavior remains limited: existing analyses typically establish convergence in expectation or with high probability, but do not address the almost sure convergence of single trajectories. In this work, we prove that DP-SGD converges almost surely under standard smoothness assumptions, both in nonconvex and strongly convex settings, provided the step sizes satisfy some standard decaying conditions. Our analysis extends to momentum variants such as the stochastic heavy ball (DP-SHB) and Nesterov's accelerated gradient (DP-NAG), where we show that careful energy constructions yield similar guarantees.

Yet, most existing methods suffer from depth estimates that are inconsistent between overlapping images. Addressing this limitation, we propose a novel geometry-guided method for calibrated, time-synchronized multi-camera rigs that predicts dense, metric, and cross-view-consistent depth. Given the intrinsic and relative orientation parameters, a first depth map is predicted per image and the so-derived 3D points from all images are projected onto a shared unit cylinder, establishing neighborhood relations across different images. This produces a 2D position map for every image, where each pixel is assigned its projected position on the cylinder.

Deep learning models often struggle with occlusions, long-range dependencies, and capturing the fine-scale geometry of rare structures. This work addresses these challenges by introducing graph-based segmentation approaches that enhance spatial and semantic understanding in surgical scene analyses.\n  Methods: We propose two segmentation models integrating Vision Transformer (ViT) feature encoders with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to explicitly model spatial relationships between anatomical regions. (1) A static k Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) graph with a Graph Convolutional Network with Initial Residual and Identity Mapping (GCNII) enables stable long-range information propagation. (2) A dynamic Differentiable Graph Generator (DGG) with a Graph Attention Network (GAT) supports adaptive topology learning. Both models are evaluated on the Endoscapes-Seg50 and CholecSeg8k benchmarks.\n  Results: The proposed approaches achieve up to 7-8% improvement in Mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and 6% improvement in Mean Dice (mDice) scores over state-of-the-art baselines. It produces anatomically coherent predictions, particularly on thin, rare and safety-critical structures.\n  Conclusion: The proposed graph-based segmentation methods enhance both performance and anatomical consistency in surgical scene segmentation. By combining ViT-based global context with graph-based relational reasoning, the models improve interpretability and reliability, paving the way for safer laparoscopic and robot-assisted surgery through a precise identification of critical anatomical features.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Vision Transformer\u548cGNN\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8179\u8154\u955c\u80c6\u56ca\u5207\u9664\u672f\u4e2d\u809d\u56ca\u80bf\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u809d\u56ca\u80bf\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9632\u6b62\u8179\u8154\u955c\u80c6\u56ca\u5207\u9664\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u624b\u672f\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u906e\u6321\u3001\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u6355\u6349\u7f55\u89c1\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\uff1a(1) \u9759\u6001k\u8fd1\u90bb\u56fe\u7ed3\u5408GCNII\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\uff1b(2) \u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u5668\u7ed3\u5408GAT\u7f51\u7edc\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u62d3\u6251\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5728Endoscapes-Seg50\u548cCholecSeg8k\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728mIoU\u4e0a\u63d0\u53477-8%\uff0c\u5728mDice\u4e0a\u63d0\u53476%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8584\u3001\u7f55\u89c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u4ea7\u751f\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7684\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408ViT\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u56fe\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u573a\u666f\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u8179\u8154\u955c\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u624b\u672f\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

Existing methods mainly mine references from support images as meta guidance. However, due to intra-class variations among visual representations, the meta information extracted from support images cannot produce accurate guidance to segment untrained classes. In this paper, we argue that the references from support images may not be essential, the key to the support role is to provide unbiased meta guidance for both trained and untrained classes. We then introduce a Language-Driven Attribute Generalization (LDAG) architecture to utilize inherent target property language descriptions to build robust support strategy. Specifically, to obtain an unbiased support representation, we design a Multi-attribute Enhancement (MaE) module, which produces multiple detailed attribute descriptions of the target class through Large Language Models (LLMs), and then builds refined visual-text prior guidance utilizing multi-modal matching.

However, their performances can often be unsatisfactory, suffering from unreliable reward improvements and slow convergence, due to high variance in gradient estimations. In this paper, we propose a universal reward profiling framework that can be seamlessly integrated with any policy gradient algorithm, where we selectively update the policy based on high-confidence performance estimations. We theoretically justify that our technique will not slow down the convergence of the baseline policy gradient methods, but with high probability, will result in stable and monotonic improvements of their performance. Empirically, on eight continuous-control benchmarks (Box2D and MuJoCo/PyBullet), our profiling yields up to 1.5x faster convergence to near-optimal returns, up to 1.75x reduction in return variance on some setups.

Despite the growing number of litter detection datasets, the problem of monitoring overflowing waste containers, particularly from images captured by garbage trucks, has received little attention. While existing datasets are valuable, they often lack annotations for specific container tracking or are captured in static, decontextualized environments, limiting their utility for real-world logistics. To address this gap, we present StreetView-Waste, a comprehensive dataset of urban scenes featuring litter and waste containers. The dataset supports three key evaluation tasks: (1) waste container detection, (2) waste container tracking, and (3) waste overflow segmentation. Alongside the dataset, we provide baselines for each task by benchmarking state-of-the-art models in object detection, tracking, and segmentation. Additionally, we enhance baseline performance by proposing two complementary strategies: a heuristic-based method for improved waste container tracking and a model-agnostic framework that leverages geometric priors to refine litter segmentation. Our experimental results show that while fine-tuned object detectors achieve reasonable performance in detecting waste containers, baseline tracking methods struggle to accurately estimate their number; however, our proposed heuristics reduce the mean absolute counting error by 79.6%. Similarly, while segmenting amorphous litter is challenging, our geometry-aware strategy improves segmentation mAP@0.5 by 27% on lightweight models, demonstrating the value of multimodal inputs for this task. Ultimately, StreetView-Waste provides a challenging benchmark to encourage research into real-world perception systems for urban waste management.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86StreetView-Waste\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u57ce\u5e02\u5783\u573e\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u5783\u573e\u7bb1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u6ea2\u6ee1\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5783\u573e\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u5783\u573e\u7bb1\u76d1\u63a7\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5783\u573e\u8f66\u62cd\u6444\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u7269\u6d41\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5783\u573e\u7bb1\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u6ea2\u6ee1\u5206\u5272\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684StreetView-Waste\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u5783\u573e\u7bb1\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5229\u7528\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u5783\u573e\u7bb1\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u7ebf\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u5927\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8ba1\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e79.6%\uff0c\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5c06\u5206\u5272mAP@0.5\u63d0\u534727%\u3002", "conclusion": "StreetView-Waste\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5783\u573e\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

ES is a set of powerful blackbox optimisation methods that can handle non-differentiable or noisy objectives with excellent scaling potential through parallelisation. Na{\u00ef}ve ES becomes prohibitively expensive at scale due to the computational and memory costs associated with generating matrix perturbations $E\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$ and the batched matrix multiplications needed to compute per-member forward passes. EGGROLL overcomes these bottlenecks by generating random matrices $A\\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times r},\\ B\\in \\mathbb{R}^{n\\times r}$ with $r\\ll \\min(m,n)$ to form a low-rank matrix perturbation $A B^\\top$ that are used in place of the full-rank perturbation $E$. As the overall update is an average across a population of $N$ workers, this still results in a high-rank update but with significant memory and computation savings, reducing the auxiliary storage from $mn$ to $r(m+n)$ per layer and the cost of a forward pass from $\\mathcal{O}(mn)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(r(m+n))$ when compared to full-rank ES. A theoretical analysis reveals our low-rank update converges to the full-rank update at a fast $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{r}\\right)$ rate.

Token pruning (keeping salient visual tokens and dropping redundant ones) has emerged as an effective approach for accelerating Vision-Language Models (VLMs), offering a solution for efficient VLA. However, these VLM-specific token pruning methods select tokens based solely on semantic salience metrics (e.g., prefill attention), while overlooking the VLA's intrinsic dual-system nature of high-level semantic understanding and low-level action execution. Consequently, these methods bias token retention toward semantic cues, discard critical information for action generation, and significantly degrade VLA performance. To bridge this gap, we propose VLA-Pruner, a versatile plug-and-play VLA-specific token prune method that aligns with the dual-system nature of VLA models and exploits the temporal continuity in robot manipulation. Specifically, VLA-Pruner adopts a dual-level importance criterion for visual token retention: vision-language prefill attention for semantic-level relevance and action decode attention, estimated via temporal smoothing, for action-level importance. Based on this criterion, VLA-Pruner proposes a novel dual-level token selection strategy that adaptively preserves a compact, informative set of visual tokens for both semantic understanding and action execution under given compute budget.

However, training these reasoning models, typically using Reinforcement Learning (RL), encounters critical efficiency bottlenecks: response generation during RL training exhibits a persistent long-tail distribution, where a few very long responses dominate execution time, wasting resources and inflating costs. To address this, we propose TLT, a system that accelerates reasoning RL training losslessly by integrating adaptive speculative decoding. Applying speculative decoding in RL is challenging due to the dynamic workloads, evolving target model, and draft model training overhead. TLT overcomes these obstacles with two synergistic components: (1) Adaptive Drafter, a lightweight draft model trained continuously on idle GPUs during long-tail generation to maintain alignment with the target model at no extra cost; and (2) Adaptive Rollout Engine, which maintains a memory-efficient pool of pre-captured CUDAGraphs and adaptively select suitable SD strategies for each input batch. Evaluations demonstrate that TLT achieves over 1.7x end-to-end RL training speedup over state-of-the-art systems, preserves the model accuracy, and yields a high-quality draft model as a free byproduct suitable for efficient deployment.

In this paper, we propose a principled sensitivity pruning score that preserves visual fidelity and foreground details at significantly higher compression ratios than existing approaches. It is computed as a second-order approximation of the reconstruction error on the training views with respect to the spatial parameters of each Gaussian. Additionally, we propose a multi-round prune-refine pipeline that can be applied to any pretrained 3D-GS model without changing its training pipeline. After pruning 90% of Gaussians, a substantially higher percentage than previous methods, our PUP 3D-GS pipeline increases average rendering speed by 3.56$\\times$ while retaining more salient foreground information and achieving higher image quality metrics than existing techniques on scenes from the Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks & Temples, and Deep Blending datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b090%\u7684\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u524d\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\u4e22\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u526a\u679d\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7a7a\u95f4\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u526a\u679d-\u7cbe\u70bc\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728Mip-NeRF 360\u3001Tanks & Temples\u548cDeep Blending\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u526a\u966490%\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u540e\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53473.56\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u524d\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we present FastSurfer-CC, an efficient and fully automated framework for corpus callosum morphometry. FastSurfer-CC automatically identifies mid-sagittal slices, segments the corpus callosum and fornix, localizes the anterior and posterior commissures to standardize head positioning, generates thickness profiles and subdivisions, and extracts eight shape metrics for statistical analysis.

Although general video prediction models have achieved remarkable performance in standard scenarios, occlusion is still an inherent challenge in video prediction. We hypothesize that providing explicit information about motion (via point-flow) and geometric structure (via depth-maps) will enable video prediction models to perform better in situations with occlusion and the background motion. To investigate this, we present the first systematic study dedicated to occluded video prediction. We use a standard multi-object latent transformer architecture to predict future frames, but modify this to incorporate information from depth and point-flow. We evaluate this model in a controlled setting on both synthetic and real-world datasets with not only appearance-based metrics but also Wasserstein distances on object masks, which can effectively measure the motion distribution of the prediction.

However, current methods rely heavily on large, high-quality microscope image datasets, which are difficult and costly to acquire due to the complexity of microrobot fabrication and the labour-intensive labelling. Digital twin systems offer a promising path for sim-to-real data augmentation, yet existing techniques struggle to replicate complex optical microscopy phenomena, such as diffraction artifacts and depth-dependent imaging.This work proposes a novel physics-informed deep generative learning framework that, for the first time, integrates wave optics-based physical rendering and depth alignment into a generative adversarial network (GAN), to synthesise high-fidelity microscope images for microrobot pose estimation efficiently. Our method improves the structural similarity index (SSIM) by 35.6% compared to purely AI-driven methods, while maintaining real-time rendering speeds (0.022 s/frame).The pose estimator (CNN backbone) trained on our synthetic data achieves 93.9%/91.9% (pitch/roll) accuracy, just 5.0%/5.4% (pitch/roll) below that of an estimator trained exclusively on real data. Furthermore, our framework generalises to unseen poses, enabling data augmentation and robust pose estimation for novel microrobot configurations without additional training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u6ce2\u5149\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5fae\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5fae\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u4e14\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u6280\u672f\u96be\u4ee5\u590d\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5149\u5b66\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6ce2\u5149\u5b66\u7269\u7406\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u6297\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eafAI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6570\u63d0\u534735.6%\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe0.022\u79d2/\u5e27\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523093.9%/91.9%\uff08\u4fef\u4ef0/\u6a2a\u6eda\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u6bd4\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f4e5.0%/5.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u5fae\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

The dynamic changes in contrast in different tissues help to highlight the tumor in post-contrast images. However, varying acquisition protocols and individual factors result in large variation in the appearance of tissues, even for images acquired in the same phase (e.g., first post-contrast phase), making automated tumor segmentation challenging. Here, we propose a tumor segmentation method that leverages knowledge of the image acquisition time to modulate model features according to the specific acquisition sequence. We incorporate the acquisition times using feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) layers, a lightweight method for incorporating temporal information that also allows for capitalizing on the full, variables number of images acquired per imaging study. We trained baseline and different configurations for the time-modulated models with varying backbone architectures on a large public multisite breast DCE-MRI dataset.

However, registering CMCs to the target scene layout presents a challenging task. While manual registration with specialized tools is inefficient and costly, automatic registration with visual localization may yield poor results when visual ambiguity exists. To alleviate these issues, we propose a novel solution for jointly mapping an indoor scene and registering CMCs to the scene layout. Our approach involves equipping a mobile agent with a head-mounted RGB-D camera to traverse the entire scene once and synchronize CMCs to capture this mobile agent. The egocentric videos generate world-coordinate agent trajectories and the scene layout, while the videos of CMCs provide pseudo-scale agent trajectories and CMC relative poses. By correlating all the trajectories with their corresponding timestamps, the CMC relative poses can be aligned to the world-coordinate scene layout. Based on this initialization, a factor graph is customized to enable the joint optimization of ego-camera poses, scene layout, and CMC poses. We also develop a new dataset, setting the first benchmark for collaborative scene mapping and CMC registration (https://sites.google.com/view/yowo/home). Experimental results indicate that our method not only effectively accomplishes two tasks within a unified framework, but also jointly enhances their performance.

Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) trains two neural networks in contrastive manner to align their image and text embeddings in a shared latent space. Recent results evaluating CLIP on negated or paraphrased text have shown mixed performance because negation changes meaning radically with minimal lexical changes, while paraphrasing can create very different textual expressions with the same intended meaning. This poses a significant challenge for improving the evaluation results and alignment of vision-language models. To address this challenge, this paper evaluates the combination of paraphrasing and negation, proposes a new CLIP contrastive loss function accounting for both paraphrasing and negation, and applies LLM-generated training triples consisting of original, paraphrased and negated textual captions to CLIP-like training models. The approach, called SemCLIP, is shown to move paraphrased captions towards the original image embeddings while pushing negated captions further away in embedding space. Empirically, SemCLIP is shown to be capable of preserving CLIP's performance while increasing considerably the distances to negated captions. On the CC-Neg benchmark using an original over negation image-retrieval accuracy metric, SemCLIP improves accuracy from 68.1% to 78.1%. Although results are mixed when compared with CLIP on the Sugarcrepe++ benchmark, SemCLIP's performance is generally better than the models trained with negated captions. This robustness to negation extends to downstream zero-shot classification tasks where SemCLIP pre-trained on Sugarcrepe++ performs better than CLIP on all tested downstream tasks. These results indicate that SemCLIP can achieve significant robustness to semantic transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SemCLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6539\u5199\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u6539\u8fdbCLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u6539\u5199\u6587\u672c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5426\u5b9a\u4f1a\u6781\u5927\u6539\u53d8\u542b\u4e49\u4f46\u8bcd\u6c47\u53d8\u5316\u5c0f\uff0c\u800c\u6539\u5199\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u8868\u8fbe\u4f46\u542b\u4e49\u76f8\u540c\uff0c\u8fd9\u7ed9\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e26\u6765\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684CLIP\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u6539\u5199\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u3001\u6539\u5199\u548c\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff09\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3CLIP\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "SemCLIP\u80fd\u5c06\u6539\u5199\u6587\u672c\u5411\u539f\u59cb\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u62c9\u8fd1\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5426\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u8fdc\u3002\u5728CC-Neg\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece68.1%\u63d0\u5347\u81f378.1%\u3002\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eCLIP\u3002", "conclusion": "SemCLIP\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CLIP\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5426\u5b9a\u548c\u6539\u5199\u6587\u672c\u3002"}}

Despite considerable progress in multi-camera tracking algorithms, tracking gymnasts presents unique challenges: (i) due to space restrictions, only a limited number of cameras can be installed in the gymnastics stadium; and (ii) due to variations in lighting, background, uniforms, and occlusions, multi-camera gymnast detection may fail in certain views and only provide valid detections from two opposing views. These factors complicate the accurate determination of a gymnast's 3D trajectory using conventional multi-camera triangulation. To alleviate this issue, we incorporate gymnastics domain knowledge into our tracking solution. Given that a gymnast's 3D center typically lies within a predefined vertical plane during \\revised{much of their} performance, we can apply a ray-plane intersection to generate coplanar 3D trajectory candidates for opposing-view detections. More specifically, we propose a novel cascaded data association (DA) paradigm that employs triangulation to generate 3D trajectory candidates when cross-view detections are sufficient, and resort to the ray-plane intersection when they are insufficient. Consequently, coplanar candidates are used to compensate for uncertain trajectories, thereby minimizing tracking failures. The robustness of our method is validated through extensive experimentation, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, our gymnastics judging system, equipped with this tracking method, has been successfully applied to recent Gymnastics World Championships, earning significant recognition from the International Gymnastics Federation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u4f53\u64cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea7\u8054\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5e73\u9762\u76f8\u4ea4\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u65f6\u76843D\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u5458\u8ddf\u8e2a\u9762\u4e34\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u573a\u5730\u7a7a\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6570\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u5149\u7167\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u906e\u6321\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u68c0\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u786e\u5b9a3D\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ea7\u8054\u6570\u636e\u5173\u8054\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5f53\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u89d2\u6d4b\u91cf\u751f\u62103D\u8f68\u8ff9\u5019\u9009\uff1b\u5f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5c04\u7ebf-\u5e73\u9762\u76f8\u4ea4\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5229\u7528\u4f53\u64cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u54583D\u4e2d\u5fc3\u901a\u5e38\u4f4d\u4e8e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u5782\u76f4\u5e73\u9762\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5171\u97623D\u8f68\u8ff9\u5019\u9009\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u8ddf\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u4f53\u64cd\u4e16\u9526\u8d5b\u88c1\u5224\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u56fd\u9645\u4f53\u64cd\u8054\u5408\u4f1a\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8ba4\u53ef\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u4f53\u64cd\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5165\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8865\u507f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f53\u64cd\u88c1\u5224\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u76843D\u8f68\u8ff9\u91cd\u5efa\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

This problem is compounded by the accelerated release cycle of novel generative models, which renders traditional detection approaches (reliant on periodic retraining) computationally infeasible and operationally impractical.\n  This work proposes a novel two-stage detection framework designed to address the generalization challenge inherent in synthetic image detection. The first stage employs a vision deep learning model trained via supervised contrastive learning to extract discriminative embeddings from input imagery. Critically, this model was trained on a strategically partitioned subset of available generators, with specific architectures withheld from training to rigorously ablate cross-generator generalization capabilities. The second stage utilizes a k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classifier operating on the learned embedding space, trained in a few-shot learning paradigm incorporating limited samples from previously unseen test generators.\n  With merely 150 images per class in the few-shot learning regime, which are easily obtainable from current generation models, the proposed framework achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.3\\%, representing a 5.2 percentage point improvement over existing approaches .

In this work, we conduct a critical analysis of Cambrian-S across both these fronts. First, we introduce a simple baseline, NoSense, which discards almost all temporal structure and uses only a bag-of-words SigLIP model, yet near-perfectly solves VSR, achieving 95% accuracy even on 4-hour videos. This shows benchmarks like VSR can be nearly solved without spatial cognition, world modeling or spatial supersensing. Second, we hypothesize that the tailored inference methods proposed by Cambrian-S likely exploit shortcut heuristics in the benchmark. We illustrate this with a simple sanity check on the VSC benchmark, called VSC-Repeat: We concatenate each video with itself 1-5 times, which does not change the number of unique objects. However, this simple perturbation entirely collapses the mean relative accuracy of Cambrian-S from 42% to 0%. A system that performs spatial supersensing and integrates information across experiences should recognize views of the same scene and keep object-count predictions unchanged; instead, Cambrian-S inference algorithm relies largely on a shortcut in the VSC benchmark that rooms are never revisited. Taken together, our findings suggest that (i) current VSI-Super benchmarks do not yet reliably measure spatial supersensing, and (ii) predictive-sensing inference recipes used by Cambrian-S improve performance by inadvertently exploiting shortcuts rather than from robust spatial supersensing. We include the response from the Cambrian-S authors (in Appendix A) to provide a balanced perspective alongside our claims.

However, progressive multi-scale generation incurs substantial memory overhead due to cumulative KV caching, limiting practical deployment.\n  We observe a scale-depth asymmetric dependency in VAR: early scales exhibit extreme sensitivity to network depth, while later scales remain robust to depth reduction. Inspired by this, we propose VARiant: by equidistant sampling, we select multiple subnets ranging from 16 to 2 layers from the original 30-layer VAR-d30 network. Early scales are processed by the full network, while later scales utilize subnet. Subnet and the full network share weights, enabling flexible depth adjustment within a single model.\n  However, weight sharing between subnet and the entire network can lead to optimization conflicts. To address this, we propose a progressive training strategy that breaks through the Pareto frontier of generation quality for both subnets and the full network under fixed-ratio training, achieving joint optimality.\n  Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that, compared to the pretrained VAR-d30 (FID 1.95), VARiant-d16 and VARiant-d8 achieve nearly equivalent quality (FID 2.05/2.12) while reducing memory consumption by 40-65%.

We introduce a method of dataset distillation for this task called Linear Gradient Matching that optimizes the synthetic images such that, when passed through a pre-trained feature extractor, they induce gradients in the linear classifier similar to those produced by the real data. Our method yields synthetic data that outperform all real-image baselines and, remarkably, generalize across pre-trained vision models, enabling us, for instance, to train a linear CLIP probe that performs competitively using a dataset distilled via a DINO backbone. Further, we show that our distilled datasets are exceptionally effective for fine-grained classification and provide a valuable tool for model interpretability, predicting, among other things, how similar two models' embedding spaces are under the platonic representation hypothesis or whether a model is sensitive to spurious correlations in adversarial datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5Linear Gradient Matching\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4f7f\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f", "method": "Linear Gradient Matching\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u76f8\u4f3c", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027"}}

To transfer rich 2D priors into POMA-3D, a view-to-scene alignment strategy is designed. Moreover, as point maps are view-dependent with respect to a canonical space, we introduce POMA-JEPA, a joint embedding-predictive architecture that enforces geometrically consistent point map features across multiple views. Additionally, we introduce ScenePoint, a point map dataset constructed from 6.5K room-level RGB-D scenes and 1M 2D image scenes to facilitate large-scale POMA-3D pretraining. Experiments show that POMA-3D serves as a strong backbone for both specialist and generalist 3D understanding. It benefits diverse tasks, including 3D question answering, embodied navigation, scene retrieval, and embodied localization, all achieved using only geometric inputs (i.e., 3D coordinates).

Golam Rabiul Alam"], "title": "Erase to Retain: Low Rank Adaptation Guided Selective Unlearning in Medical Segmentation Networks", "comment": null, "summary": "The ability to selectively remove knowledge from medical segmentation networks is increasingly important for privacy compliance, ethical deployment, and continual dataset revision. We introduce Erase to Retain, a controllable unlearning framework for medical image segmentation that achieves targeted forgetting without full retraining. Our method uses a teacher-student distillation paradigm with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) constrained subspace updates, enabling the student network to erase lesion-specific or class-specific representations in low-rank decoder spaces while preserving global anatomical understanding. During the strong unlearning phase, LoRA modules are adversarially optimized to contradict the teacher's confident predictions on a designated forget subset, enforcing semantic removal. This is followed by a gentle restoration phase that recovers generalization on retained data through head-only supervised refinement.\n  For ISIC segmentation, the student reduces forget-set IoU from 0.875 to 0.509 while maintaining competitive performance on the retain and validation splits (0.647 to 0.677 IoU). On the cross-domain CHASE dataset, Erase to Retain consistently lowers forget-set IoU while preserving utility on retain and validation sets. For ISIC classification, our method decreases accuracy on the forget subset from 87.0 percent to 64.1 percent while improving retain accuracy from 83.9 percent to 90.6 percent.\n  These results demonstrate that LoRA-based subspace unlearning provides a practical pathway toward responsible, controllable, and reversible unlearning in medical image analysis, enabling models to forget sensitive samples or structures while preserving performance where it matters most.", "AI": {"tldr": "Erase to Retain\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u548cLoRA\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\u9057\u5fd8\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u5206\u5272\u7f51\u7edc\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u77e5\u8bc6\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u90e8\u7f72\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6301\u7eed\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u654f\u611f\u6837\u672c\u6216\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u84b8\u998f\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LoRA\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u9057\u5fd8\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u4f18\u5316LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u6d88\u9664\u76ee\u6807\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u6e29\u548c\u6062\u590d\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u6062\u590d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728ISIC\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6IoU\u4ece0.875\u964d\u81f30.509\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u5728ISIC\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece87.0%\u964d\u81f364.1%\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u96c6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece83.9%\u63d0\u5347\u81f390.6%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u9057\u5fd8\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u9006\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u654f\u611f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Processing long videos demands both an efficient model architecture and an effective mechanism for handling extended temporal contexts. To this end, TimeViper adopts a hybrid Mamba-Transformer backbone that combines the efficiency of state-space models with the expressivity of attention mechanisms. Through this hybrid design, we reveal the vision-to-text information aggregation phenomenon, where information progressively flows from vision tokens to text tokens across increasing LLM depth, resulting in severe vision token redundancy. Motivated by this observation, we propose TransV, a token information transfer module that transfers and compresses vision tokens into instruction tokens while maintaining multimodal understanding capabilities. This design enables TimeViper to process hour-long videos exceeding 10,000 frames. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TimeViper competes with state-of-the-art models while extending frame numbers.

Interactive Video Object Segmentation (iVOS) models such as Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) provide prompt-based flexibility beyond methods with predefined categories, but face challenges in surgical scenarios due to the domain gap and limited long-term tracking. To address these limitations, we construct SA-SV, the largest surgical iVOS benchmark with instance-level spatio-temporal annotations (masklets) spanning eight procedure types (61k frames, 1.6k masklets), enabling comprehensive development and evaluation for long-term tracking and zero-shot generalization.

However, real-world scenarios introduce the challenge of long-tailed distributions, where numerous categories contain only a few instances. This inherent class imbalance biases detection models towards the more frequent classes, degrading performance on rare categories. In this paper, we tackle the problem of long-tailed 2D object detection using the LVISv1 dataset, which consists of 1,203 categories and 164,000 images. We employ a two-stage Faster R-CNN architecture and propose enhancements to the Balanced Group Softmax (BAGS) framework to mitigate class imbalance. Our approach achieves a new state-of-the-art performance with a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 24.5%, surpassing the previous benchmark of 24.0%.\n  Additionally, we hypothesize that tail class features may form smaller, denser clusters within the feature space of head classes, making classification challenging for regression-based classifiers.

We introduce SurvAgent, the first hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT)-enhanced multi-agent system for multimodal survival prediction.

Both generate structured reports with CoT reasoning, storing complete analytical processes for experiential learning. (2) Dichotomy-Based Multi-Expert Agent Inference retrieves similar cases via RAG and integrates multimodal reports with expert predictions through progressive interval refinement.

Despite the progress, previous 3DHS methods have overlooked following two challenges: I) multi-label learning with a parameter-sharing model can lead to multi-hierarchy conflicts in cross-hierarchy optimization, and II) the class imbalance issue is inevitable across multiple hierarchies of 3D scenes, which makes the model performance become dominated by major classes. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework with a primary 3DHS branch and an auxiliary discrimination branch. Specifically, to alleviate the multi-hierarchy conflicts, we propose a late-decoupled 3DHS framework which employs multiple decoders with the coarse-to-fine hierarchical guidance and consistency. The late-decoupled architecture can mitigate the underfitting and overfitting conflicts among multiple hierarchies and can also constrain the class imbalance problem in each individual hierarchy. Moreover, we introduce a 3DHS-oriented semantic prototype based bi-branch supervision mechanism, which additionally learns class-wise discriminative point cloud features and performs mutual supervision between the auxiliary and 3DHS branches, to enhance the class-imbalance segmentation.

To address this challenge, we introduce a novel teacher-guided pruning framework that tightly integrates Knowledge Distillation (KD) with importance score estimation. Unlike prior approaches that apply KD as a post-pruning recovery step, our method leverages gradient signals informed by the teacher during importance score calculation to identify and retain parameters most critical for both task performance and knowledge transfer. Our method facilitates a one-shot global pruning strategy that efficiently eliminates redundant weights while preserving essential representations. After pruning, we employ sparsity-aware retraining with and without KD to recover accuracy without reactivating pruned connections. Comprehensive experiments across multiple image classification benchmarks, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves high sparsity levels with minimal performance degradation. Notably, our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as EPG and EPSD at high sparsity levels, while offering a more computationally efficient alternative to iterative pruning schemes like COLT.

Although extensively studied, existing UV unwrapping methods frequently struggle with AI-generated meshes, which are typically noisy, bumpy, and poorly conditioned. These methods often produce highly fragmented charts and suboptimal boundaries, introducing artifacts and hindering downstream tasks. We introduce PartUV, a part-based UV unwrapping pipeline that generates significantly fewer, part-aligned charts while maintaining low distortion. Built on top of a recent learning-based part decomposition method PartField, PartUV combines high-level semantic part decomposition with novel geometric heuristics in a top-down recursive framework. It ensures each chart's distortion remains below a user-specified threshold while minimizing the total number of charts. The pipeline integrates and extends parameterization and packing algorithms, incorporates dedicated handling of non-manifold and degenerate meshes, and is extensively parallelized for efficiency. Evaluated across four diverse datasets, including man-made, CAD, AI-generated, and Common Shapes, PartUV outperforms existing tools and recent neural methods in chart count and seam length, achieves comparable distortion, exhibits high success rates on challenging meshes, and enables new applications like part-specific multi-tiles packing.

Despite notable efforts in 4D generative modeling, existing methods exhibit fundamental limitations that impede their broader applicability, including temporal and geometric inconsistencies, perceptual artifacts, motion irregularities, high computational costs, and limited control over dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose TriDiff-4D, a novel 4D generative pipeline that employs diffusion-based triplane re-posing to produce high-quality, temporally coherent 4D avatars. Our model adopts an auto-regressive strategy to generate 4D sequences of arbitrary length, synthesizing each 3D frame with a single diffusion process. By explicitly learning 3D structure and motion priors from large-scale 3D and motion datasets, TriDiff-4D enables skeleton-driven 4D generation that excels in temporal consistency, motion accuracy, computational efficiency, and visual fidelity. Specifically, TriDiff-4D first generates a canonical 3D avatar and a corresponding motion sequence from a text prompt, then uses a second diffusion model to animate the avatar according to the motion sequence, supporting arbitrarily long 4D generation. Experimental results demonstrate that TriDiff-4D significantly outperforms existing methods, reducing generation time from hours to seconds by eliminating the optimization process, while substantially improving the generation of complex motions with high-fidelity appearance and accurate 3D geometry.", "AI": {"tldr": "TriDiff-4D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u76844D\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u76844D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u77403D\u52a8\u753b\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u76844D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u4f2a\u5f71\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u63a7\u5236\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6839\u672c\u6027\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u76844D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a3D\u5e27\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5408\u6210\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u4ece\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u89c4\u83033D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u6dfb\u52a0\u52a8\u753b\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4efb\u610f\u957f\u5ea6\u76844D\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTriDiff-4D\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u79d2\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5916\u89c2\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "TriDiff-4D\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u5b66\u4e603D\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u7684\u9aa8\u67b6\u9a71\u52a84D\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a4D\u865a\u62df\u5f62\u8c61\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, achieving simultaneous control over the 9D poses (location, size, and orientation) of multiple objects remains an open challenge. Despite recent progress, existing methods often suffer from limited controllability and degraded quality, falling short of comprehensive multi-object 9D pose control. To address these limitations, we propose SceneDesigner, a method for accurate and flexible multi-object 9-DoF pose manipulation. SceneDesigner incorporates a branched network to the pre-trained base model and leverages a new representation, CNOCS map, which encodes 9D pose information from the camera view. This representation exhibits strong geometric interpretation properties, leading to more efficient and stable training. To support training, we construct a new dataset, ObjectPose9D, which aggregates images from diverse sources along with 9D pose annotations. To further address data imbalance issues, particularly performance degradation on low-frequency poses, we introduce a two-stage training strategy with reinforcement learning, where the second stage fine-tunes the model using a reward-based objective on rebalanced data. At inference time, we propose Disentangled Object Sampling, a technique that mitigates insufficient object generation and concept confusion in complex multi-object scenes. Moreover, by integrating user-specific personalization weights, SceneDesigner enables customized pose control for reference subjects. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that SceneDesigner significantly outperforms existing approaches in both controllability and quality.

Motivated by video's inherent capacity to demonstrate physical-world information that is difficult to convey through language alone (e.g., imagine teaching someone to tie a tie using only text), we identify an underutilized opportunity to extend video as a new answer modality for Next-Event Prediction (NEP), formalized as Video-Next-Event Prediction (VNEP). While the established NEP task takes a video with a procedural or predictive question as input to predict the next event in text, VNEP requires dynamic video responses. This shift from telling to showing unlocks more intuitive and customized answers for procedural learning and creative exploration. However, this task remains challenging for existing models, as it demands an understanding of multimodal input, instruction-conditioned reasoning, and the generation of video with visual and semantic consistency. To address this, we introduce VANS, a model that leverages reinforcement learning to align a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with a Video Diffusion Model (VDM) for VNEP. The core of VANS is our proposed Joint-GRPO that orchestrates the VLM and VDM to function as a unit. Driven by a shared reward on their respective output, it optimizes the VLM to produce captions that are both accurate and friendly to visualize, while guiding the VDM to generate videos that are faithful to these captions and the input visual context.

Such a two-system thinking mechanism allows us to efficiently allocate cognitive resources, enabling quick decision-making for straightforward issues while reserving deeper analytical thinking for more intricate challenges.

In this work, we propose a simple RL approach, which enables VLMs to automatically switch between fast and slow thinking modes depending on task difficulty. The approach consists of two stages: in the first stage, we label data as either requiring fast thinking or slow thinking based on the model output length, which is inspired by the observation that pre-trained VLMs typically produce answers of varying lengths for different types of questions; in the second stage, we train the model using GRPO along with the thinking mode labels to develop dual-mode thinking.

In this preliminary study, we introduce Thinking-while-Generating (TwiG), the first interleaved framework that enables co-evolving textual reasoning throughout the visual generation process. As visual content is progressively generating, textual reasoning is interleaved to both guide upcoming local regions and reflect on previously synthesized ones. This dynamic interplay produces more context-aware and semantically rich visual outputs. To unveil the potential of this framework, we investigate three candidate strategies, zero-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our curated TwiG-50K dataset, and reinforcement learning (RL) via a customized TwiG-GRPO strategy, each offering unique insights into the dynamics of interleaved reasoning.

To this end, we propose a self-evolving framework, named EvoLMM, that instantiates two cooperative agents from a single backbone model: a Proposer, which generates diverse, image-grounded questions, and a Solver, which solves them through internal consistency, where learning proceeds through a continuous self-rewarding process. This dynamic feedback encourages both the generation of informative queries and the refinement of structured reasoning without relying on ground-truth or human judgments.

For this task, beyond a set of images, many prior state-of-the-art methods use accurate \"ground-truth\" camera poses and human poses as input to guide reconstruction at test-time. We show that pose-dependent reconstruction degrades results significantly if pose estimates are noisy. To overcome this, we introduce NoPo-Avatar, which reconstructs avatars solely from images, without any pose input. By removing the dependence of test-time reconstruction on human poses, NoPo-Avatar is not affected by noisy human pose estimates, making it more widely applicable. Experiments on challenging THuman2.0, XHuman, and HuGe100K data show that NoPo-Avatar outperforms existing baselines in practical settings (without ground-truth poses) and delivers comparable results in lab settings (with ground-truth poses).", "AI": {"tldr": "NoPo-Avatar\uff1a\u65e0\u9700\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u5316\u8eab\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5730\u9762\u771f\u5b9e\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNoPo-Avatar\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ec5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u5316\u8eab\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56", "result": "\u5728THuman2.0\u3001XHuman\u548cHuGe100K\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u771f\u5b9e\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0cNoPo-Avatar\u80fd\u591f\u62b5\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f"}}
