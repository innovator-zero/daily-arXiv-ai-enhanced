TL;DR: 该研究通过微调ESA-IBM的TerraMind地理空间基础模型，使用全球85个洪水事件的FloodsNet多模态数据集，评估了不同配置在洪水范围制图上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水是最具破坏性的天气相关灾害之一，2024年是有记录以来最暖年份，极端洪水事件影响了五大洲的社区。虽然地球观测卫星为洪水制图提供了关键数据，但操作精度严重依赖标记数据集和模型泛化能力。地理空间基础模型通过大规模自监督预训练提高了泛化性，但其在全球多样化洪水事件中的性能尚不清楚。

Method: 使用FloodsNet数据集（包含85个全球洪水事件的Sentinel-1 SAR和Sentinel-2光学协同定位图像）微调TerraMind模型。测试了四种配置（基础vs大型模型；冻结vs非冻结骨干网络），并与TerraMind Sen1Floods11示例和基于两个数据集训练的U-Net进行比较。

Result: 基础非冻结配置在准确性、精确度和召回率方面达到最佳平衡，计算成本显著低于大型模型。大型非冻结模型获得最高召回率。FloodsNet训练的模型在召回率上优于Sen1Floods11训练的示例，总体准确性相似。U-Net比所有GFM配置获得更高召回率，但准确性和精确度略低。

Conclusion: 整合多模态光学和SAR数据并微调GFM可以增强近实时洪水制图能力。该研究首次在全球范围内评估GFM用于洪水分割，既展示了其在气候适应和灾害韧性方面的潜力，也指出了当前局限性。

Abstract: Floods are among the most damaging weather-related hazards, and in 2024, the warmest year on record, extreme flood events affected communities across five continents. Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.
  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model. The large unfrozen model achieved the highest recall. Models trained on FloodsNet outperformed the Sen1Floods11-trained example in recall with similar overall accuracy. U-Net achieved higher recall than all GFM configurations, though with slightly lower accuracy and precision.
  Our results demonstrate that integrating multimodal optical and SAR data and fine-tuning a GFM can enhance near-real-time flood mapping. This study provides one of the first global-scale evaluations of a GFM for flood segmentation, highlighting both its potential and current limitations for climate adaptation and disaster resilience.

### [2] [Context-Enriched Contrastive Loss: Enhancing Presentation of Inherent Sample Connections in Contrastive Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02152)
*Haojin Deng,Yimin Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种上下文丰富的对比损失函数，通过包含两个收敛目标来同时提高学习效果并解决信息失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对比学习在处理增强样本时可能引入信息失真，模型过度依赖相同标签样本的信息，而忽视来自同一原始图像的正样本对。

Method: 提出的损失函数包含两个组件：第一个组件对标签对比敏感，区分相同和不同类别的特征；第二个组件拉近来自同一源图像的增强样本，同时远离其他样本。

Result: 在8个大规模基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在泛化性能和学习收敛速度上优于16种最先进的对比学习方法，在BiasedMNIST数据集上相比原始对比损失函数有22.9%的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法在解决系统性失真任务方面表现突出，为更高效和公平的下游训练提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves improvements over 16 state-of-the-art contrastive learning methods in terms of both generalization performance and learning convergence speed. Interestingly, our technique stands out in addressing systematic distortion tasks. It demonstrates a 22.9% improvement compared to original contrastive loss functions in the downstream BiasedMNIST dataset, highlighting its promise for more efficient and equitable downstream training.

### [3] [FineGRAIN: Evaluating Failure Modes of Text-to-Image Models with Vision Language Model Judges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02161)
*Kevin David Hayes,Micah Goldblum,Vikash Sehwag,Gowthami Somepalli,Ashwinee Panda,Tom Goldstein*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个联合评估文本到图像模型和视觉语言模型的层次化框架，通过测试VLM能否识别T2I模型生成的图像中的27种特定错误模式，并创建了包含5个T2I模型和3个VLM的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前T2I模型在生成图像时经常无法准确捕捉用户提示中的特定属性（如物体数量和颜色），同时VLM的基准测试未能跟上复杂场景的需求，需要更精细的评估框架。

Method: 开发结构化方法，使用挑战性提示测试T2I模型生成图像，然后通过VLM识别27种特定错误模式，最后用LLM验证VLM的标注准确性。数据集包含5个T2I模型和3个VLM的生成结果。

Result: 分析显示T2I模型在属性保真度和物体表示方面存在系统性错误，当前评估指标无法捕捉这些细微错误。

Conclusion: 需要有针对性的基准测试来提升生成模型的可靠性和可解释性，当前指标不足以评估模型的真实表现。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are capable of generating visually impressive images, yet they often fail to accurately capture specific attributes in user prompts, such as the correct number of objects with the specified colors. The diversity of such errors underscores the need for a hierarchical evaluation framework that can compare prompt adherence abilities of different image generation models. Simultaneously, benchmarks of vision language models (VLMs) have not kept pace with the complexity of scenes that VLMs are used to annotate. In this work, we propose a structured methodology for jointly evaluating T2I models and VLMs by testing whether VLMs can identify 27 specific failure modes in the images generated by T2I models conditioned on challenging prompts. Our second contribution is a dataset of prompts and images generated by 5 T2I models (Flux, SD3-Medium, SD3-Large, SD3.5-Medium, SD3.5-Large) and the corresponding annotations from VLMs (Molmo, InternVL3, Pixtral) annotated by an LLM (Llama3) to test whether VLMs correctly identify the failure mode in a generated image. By analyzing failure modes on a curated set of prompts, we reveal systematic errors in attribute fidelity and object representation. Our findings suggest that current metrics are insufficient to capture these nuanced errors, highlighting the importance of targeted benchmarks for advancing generative model reliability and interpretability.

### [4] [Mapping of Lesion Images to Somatic Mutations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02162)
*Rahul Mehta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LLOST模型通过双变分自编码器将医学图像和体细胞突变数据耦合到共享潜在空间，实现从医学图像预测癌症患者的体细胞突变谱


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症治疗的有效性依赖于早期诊断和治疗，但传统上需要分别进行医学成像和基因检测，本研究旨在通过医学图像直接预测体细胞突变谱，实现更早的个性化治疗选择

Method: 提出LLOST模型：1）使用点云表示病灶图像以获得模态不变性；2）构建双变分自编码器，通过共享潜在空间统一病灶点云和体细胞突变计数特征；3）使用条件归一化流先验学习三个潜在空间的分布

Result: 在TCIA和TCGA Pan Cancer数据集上的实验表明，模型能够准确预测特定突变的计数和突变发生情况，并发现反映癌症类型的成像和体细胞突变域之间的共享模式

Conclusion: 模型可通过医学图像预测体细胞突变，为早期个性化癌症治疗提供可能，未来可扩展到其他遗传领域

Abstract: Medical imaging is a critical initial tool used by clinicians to determine a patient's cancer diagnosis, allowing for faster intervention and more reliable patient prognosis. At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type. We conclude with a remark on how to improve the model and possible future avenues of research to include other genetic domains.

### [5] [SplatSuRe: Selective Super-Resolution for Multi-view Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02172)
*Pranav Asthana,Alex Hanson,Allen Tu,Tom Goldstein,Matthias Zwicker,Amitabh Varshney*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SplatSuRe方法，通过选择性应用超分辨率内容来解决3D高斯泼溅中多视图不一致问题，在欠采样区域添加细节，实现更清晰一致的渲染效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法独立增强每张低分辨率图像会导致多视图不一致和模糊渲染。作者发现近距离视图可能包含远处视图区域的高频信息，可以利用相机姿态与场景几何关系来指导超分辨率内容的添加。

Method: 提出SplatSuRe方法，基于相机姿态和场景几何信息，仅在缺乏高频监督的欠采样区域选择性应用超分辨率内容，而不是在所有图像上统一应用超分辨率。

Result: 在Tanks & Temples、Deep Blending和Mip-NeRF 360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在保真度和感知质量上均优于基线方法，特别是在需要更高细节的局部前景区域效果最为显著。

Conclusion: 选择性超分辨率策略能够有效提升3D高斯泼溅的渲染质量，通过智能地利用视图间的互补信息，解决了多视图一致性问题，实现了更锐利和一致的渲染结果。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables high-quality novel view synthesis, motivating interest in generating higher-resolution renders than those available during training. A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results. Across Tanks & Temples, Deep Blending and Mip-NeRF 360, our approach surpasses baselines in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Notably, our gains are most significant in localized foreground regions where higher detail is desired.

### [6] [RobustSurg: Tackling domain generalisation for out-of-distribution surgical scene segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02188)
*Mansoor Ali,Maksim Richards,Gilberto Ochoa-Ruiz,Sharib Ali*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出RobustSurg方法，通过利用手术场景中的风格和内容信息来提升跨中心和跨模态的泛化能力，在手术场景分割任务中取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习手术场景分割方法在单中心和单模态数据上表现良好，但无法泛化到未见过的分布和模态。现有自然场景的域泛化方法不能直接应用于手术场景，因为手术场景视觉线索有限且场景极其多样。

Method: 采用实例归一化和特征协方差映射技术来获得鲁棒的特征表示；在ResNet骨干网络中引入恢复模块，保留有用的任务相关特征；还提供了新的多类别多中心数据集。

Result: 在HeiCholSeg数据集上，相比基线DeepLabv3+提升了近23%，相比SOTA方法提升了10-32%的mIoU；在EndoUDA息肉数据集上，相比基线提升了22%，相比最新SOTA方法提升了11%。

Conclusion: RobustSurg方法通过风格-内容解耦和特征恢复机制，有效提升了手术场景分割的跨域泛化能力，为手术AI的临床应用提供了重要进展。

Abstract: While recent advances in deep learning for surgical scene segmentation have demonstrated promising results on single-centre and single-imaging modality data, these methods usually do not generalise to unseen distribution (i.e., from other centres) and unseen modalities. Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K. Similarly, RobustSurg also obtained nearly 22% improvement over the baseline and nearly 11% improvement on a recent SOTA method for the target set of the EndoUDA polyp dataset.

### [7] [Multifractal Recalibration of Neural Networks for Medical Imaging Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02198)
*Miguel L. Martins,Miguel T. Coimbra,Francesco Renna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种归纳先验方法：单分形和多重分形重新校准，用于解决现有端到端多重分形方法在语义分割等任务中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端多重分形方法依赖重池化或强特征空间抽取，限制了语义分割等任务的应用。

Method: 引入单分形和多重分形重新校准两种归纳先验方法，利用指数概率质量与多重分形谱之间的关系形成编码器嵌入的统计描述，作为卷积网络中的通道注意力函数实现。

Result: 在三个公共医学影像数据集（ISIC18、Kvasir-SEG、BUSI）上验证，多重分形重新校准相比使用高阶统计的其他通道注意力机制基线有显著提升。

Conclusion: 研究发现U-Net架构中由于跳跃连接，激励响应不会随编码器深度增加而变得专门化，其有效性可能与实例变异性的全局统计有关。

Abstract: Multifractal analysis has revealed regularities in many self-seeding phenomena, yet its use in modern deep learning remains limited. Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.
  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).
  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers. We find that excitation responses do not become increasingly specialized with encoder depth in U-Net architectures due to skip connections, and that their effectiveness may relate to global statistics of instance variability.

### [8] [Towards Unified Video Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02224)
*Chen Feng,Tianhao Peng,Fan Zhang,David Bull*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Unified-VQA框架，通过将通用视频质量评估重新定义为诊断性混合专家问题，解决了现有方法缺乏可解释性和格式特异性限制的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估方法通常采用单一模型预测整体质量分数，无法提供诊断性反馈，且多为格式特定的专门化指标而非真正通用的解决方案。

Method: 采用诊断性混合专家框架，包含多个专门针对不同感知领域的感知专家，使用多代理专家训练策略和弱监督学习优化，生成全局质量分数和可解释的多维伪影向量。

Result: 在17个包含HD、UHD、HDR和HFR格式多样化流媒体伪影的数据库上，Unified-VQA在静态模型参数下（无需重新训练或微调）相比18种基准方法在通用VQA和诊断伪影检测任务中均表现出持续优越性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作代表了向实用、可操作和可解释的视频质量评估迈出的重要一步。

Abstract: Recent works in video quality assessment (VQA) typically employ monolithic models that typically predict a single quality score for each test video. These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats. This work represents an important step towards practical, actionable, and interpretable video quality assessment.

*Le Thien Phuc Nguyen,Zhuoran Yu,Samuel Low Yu Hang,Subin An,Jeongik Lee,Yohan Ban,SeungEun Chung,Thanh-Huy Nguyen,JuWan Maeng,Soochahn Lee,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AV-SpeakerBench是一个针对多模态大语言模型的说话人中心视听推理基准，包含3,212个多选题，专注于评估模型在真实视频中识别谁说话、说了什么以及何时说话的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频基准很少评估对人类语音的细粒度推理，许多任务仅通过视觉即可解决或对语音评估粗糙，无法深入了解模型是否能对齐说话人、内容和时间信息。

Method: 提出AV-SpeakerBench基准，采用说话人中心的表述方式，将说话人而非场景作为核心推理单元；设计融合基础的问答，将视听依赖嵌入问题语义；通过专家标注确保时间精度和跨模态有效性。

Result: 评估显示Gemini系列模型持续优于开源系统，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现最佳。开源模型中Qwen3-Omni-30B接近Gemini 2.0 Flash但仍远落后于Gemini 2.5 Pro，主要差距在于视听融合能力而非视觉感知。

Conclusion: AV-SpeakerBench为未来多模态系统的细粒度视听推理建立了严格的基础，将推动该领域的发展。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are expected to jointly interpret vision, audio, and language, yet existing video benchmarks rarely assess fine-grained reasoning about human speech. Many tasks remain visually solvable or only coarsely evaluate speech, offering limited insight into whether models can align who speaks, what is said, and when it occurs. We introduce AV-SpeakerBench, a curated benchmark of 3,212 multiple-choice questions focused on speaker-centric audiovisual reasoning in real-world videos. It features: (1) a speaker-centered formulation that treats speakers-not scenes-as the core reasoning unit; (2) fusion-grounded question design embedding audiovisual dependencies into question semantics; and (3) expert-curated annotations ensuring temporal precision and cross-modal validity. Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results. Among open models, Qwen3-Omni-30B approaches Gemini 2.0 Flash but remains far behind Gemini 2.5 Pro, primarily due to weaker audiovisual fusion rather than visual perception. We believe AV-SpeakerBench establishes a rigorous foundation for advancing fine-grained audiovisual reasoning in future multimodal systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新型的视觉LIF（VLIF）神经元和相应的脉冲神经网络框架，用于图像去雨任务，在显著降低能耗的同时实现了优于现有SNN方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脉冲神经网络在低层视觉任务中缺乏空间上下文理解能力的问题，以及传统脉冲神经元在频域饱和方面的局限性。

Method: 提出VLIF神经元来克服传统脉冲神经元缺乏空间上下文理解的障碍；引入脉冲分解增强模块和轻量级脉冲多尺度单元，实现分层多尺度表示学习。

Result: 在五个基准去雨数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的SNN去雨方法，且仅消耗其13%的能量。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在高性能、低能耗的低层视觉任务中部署SNN奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Biologically plausible and energy-efficient frameworks such as Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have not been sufficiently explored in low-level vision tasks. Taking image deraining as an example, this study addresses the representation of the inherent high-pass characteristics of spiking neurons, specifically in image deraining and innovatively proposes the Visual LIF (VLIF) neuron, overcoming the obstacle of lacking spatial contextual understanding present in traditional spiking neurons. To tackle the limitation of frequency-domain saturation inherent in conventional spiking neurons, we leverage the proposed VLIF to introduce the Spiking Decomposition and Enhancement Module and the lightweight Spiking Multi-scale Unit for hierarchical multi-scale representation learning. Extensive experiments across five benchmark deraining datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SNN-based deraining methods, achieving this superior performance with only 13\% of their energy consumption. These findings establish a solid foundation for deploying SNNs in high-performance, energy-efficient low-level vision tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出了时空金字塔流（SPF）方法，用于高效、多时间尺度的气候模拟，通过分层建模和并行采样技术解决了传统自回归方法在长期气候模拟中的计算效率问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于天气尺度自回归的生成模型在长期气候模拟中存在计算效率低、非平稳强迫下稳定性差的问题，需要开发能够高效并行模拟多时间尺度的新方法。

Method: SPF方法将生成轨迹划分为时空金字塔，逐步提高空间分辨率以减少计算量，每个阶段与特定时间尺度耦合，并通过对物理强迫（如温室气体或气溶胶）的条件化实现并行气候模拟。

Result: 在ClimateBench基准测试中，SPF在年尺度和月尺度上优于强基线模型，同时提供快速采样；通过构建包含33,000模拟年的ClimateSuite数据集，SPF展现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SPF和ClimateSuite为跨时间尺度和真实未来情景的准确、高效、概率性气候模拟提供了基础，相关数据和代码已开源。

Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios. Data and code is publicly available at https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/spf .

### [12] [Progressive Image Restoration via Text-Conditioned Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02273)
*Peng Kang,Xijun Wang,Yu Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新利用CogVideo模型进行渐进式视觉修复任务，通过微调使其生成修复轨迹而非自然视频运动，在超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强任务上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型在时间生成方面表现出色，但它们在图像修复方面的潜力尚未被充分探索。

Method: 构建合成数据集用于超分辨率、去模糊和低光增强任务，每个样本展示从退化到清晰帧的渐进过渡。比较两种提示策略：统一文本提示和基于LLaVA多模态LLM生成的场景特定提示。

Result: 微调后的模型能够将时间进展与修复质量关联，产生的序列在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS等感知指标上持续改善。模型在ReLoBlur数据集上表现出零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: CogVideo能够有效恢复空间细节和光照一致性，同时保持时间连贯性，展示了强大的零样本鲁棒性和通过时间修复的可解释性。

Abstract: Recent text-to-video models have demonstrated strong temporal generation capabilities, yet their potential for image restoration remains underexplored. In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.

Motivation: 解决深度学习SAR油污分割模型在不同海域（特别是秘鲁海岸）因海况、后向散射统计和油污形态差异导致的泛化能力差的问题，特别是在标记数据稀缺的情况下。

Method: 两阶段方法：阶段A使用形态学区域扰动（曲率引导的标签空间方法）生成油污和类似区域的几何变化；阶段B使用条件生成INADE模型从编辑后的掩码渲染SAR样纹理。

Result: 在秘鲁数据集上，预训练在地中海数据的模型mIoU从67.8%下降到51.8%；使用MORP-Synth后性能提升最多+6 mIoU，少数类IoU显著提升（油污类+10.8，类似类+14.6）。

Conclusion: MORP-Synth有效提升了SAR油污分割模型的跨区域泛化能力，特别是在数据稀缺的秘鲁海岸区域，通过合成数据增强显著改善了模型性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models for SAR oil spill segmentation often fail to generalize across regions due to differences in sea-state, backscatter statistics, and slick morphology, a limitation that is particularly severe along the Peruvian coast where labeled Sentinel-1 data remain scarce. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{MORP--Synth}, a two-stage synthetic augmentation framework designed to improve transfer from Mediterranean to Peruvian conditions. Stage~A applies Morphological Region Perturbation, a curvature guided label space method that generates realistic geometric variations of oil and look-alike regions. Stage~B renders SAR-like textures from the edited masks using a conditional generative INADE model. We compile a Peruvian dataset of 2112 labeled 512$\times$512 patches from 40 Sentinel-1 scenes (2014--2024), harmonized with the Mediterranean CleanSeaNet benchmark, and evaluate seven segmentation architectures. Models pretrained on Mediterranean data degrade from 67.8\% to 51.8\% mIoU on the Peruvian domain; MORP--Synth improves performance up to +6 mIoU and boosts minority-class IoU (+10.8 oil, +14.6 look-alike).

Conclusion: 视频扩散模型天然具备学习运动表示的能力，为自监督跟踪提供了新的有效途径，特别是在处理视觉相似物体区分这一传统方法的薄弱环节上表现出色。

Abstract: Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.

Abstract: 3D vision foundation models have shown strong generalization in reconstructing key 3D attributes from uncalibrated images through a single feed-forward pass. However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation into how alternative LiDAR-to-image projections affect metric place recognition when coupled with a state-of-the-art vision foundation model. We introduce a modular retrieval pipeline that controls for backbone, aggregation, and evaluation protocol, thereby isolating the influence of the 2-D projection itself. Using consistent geometric and structural channels across multiple datasets and deployment scenarios, we identify the projection characteristics that most strongly determine discriminative power, robustness to environmental variation, and suitability for real-time autonomy. Experiments with different datasets, including integration into an operational place recognition policy, validate the practical relevance of these findings and demonstrate that carefully designed projections can serve as an effective surrogate for end-to-end 3-D learning in LiDAR place recognition.

Abstract: In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success in various synthetic aperture radar (SAR) tasks. However, the complexity and opacity of their internal mechanisms hinder the fulfillment of high-reliability requirements, thereby limiting their application in SAR. Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated. Key factors affecting localization accuracy, such as pixel thresholds, are analyzed in depth to inform future work.

Abstract: Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.

Conclusion: 理解组件具有较好的压缩性，生成组件对压缩敏感；通过MoE稀疏激活方法可以有效提升统一多模态模型的推理效率。

Abstract: Large multimodal models have achieved remarkable progress in both understanding and generation. Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Abstract: Modeling dynamic 3D environments from LiDAR sequences is central to building reliable 4D worlds for autonomous driving and embodied AI. Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a "hard-to-easy" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors. To further ensure temporal coherence, U4D incorporates a mixture of spatio-temporal (MoST) block that adaptively fuses spatial and temporal representations during diffusion. Extensive experiments show that U4D produces geometrically faithful and temporally consistent LiDAR sequences, advancing the reliability of 4D world modeling for autonomous perception and simulation.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting can effectively mitigate occlusion issues that commonly arise in single-image crowd counting. Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods. Code is released in https://github.com/zqyq/Weakly-MVCC.

Conclusion: SurfFill成功结合了LiDAR和相机优势，通过Gaussian surfel方法有效解决了LiDAR点云补全问题，特别适用于大规模场景重建。

Abstract: LiDAR-captured point clouds are often considered the gold standard in active 3D reconstruction. While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.

Conclusion: VACoT通过推理阶段的动态图像增强，有效提升了视觉语言模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，避免了昂贵的重新训练成本。

Abstract: While visual data augmentation remains a cornerstone for training robust vision models, it has received limited attention in visual language models (VLMs), which predominantly rely on large-scale real data acquisition or synthetic diversity. Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.

Abstract: This study explores the application of machine learning models, specifically a pretrained ResNet-50 model and a general SqueezeNet model, in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) using chest X-ray images. TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources. However, despite promising results, the need for continued development of faster, smaller, and more accurate TB detection models remains crucial in contributing to the global efforts in combating TB.

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is crucial for the reliability and safety of autonomous driving systems, yet it remains a challenging task in complex interactive scenarios. Existing methods often struggle to efficiently extract valuable scene information from redundant data, thereby reducing computational efficiency and prediction accuracy, especially when dealing with intricate agent interactions. To address these challenges, we propose a novel map-free trajectory prediction algorithm that achieves trajectory prediction across the temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. Specifically, in temporal information processing, We utilize a Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism to adaptively select critical frequency components. Concurrently, we extract these components and integrate multi-scale temporal features. Subsequently, a selective attention module is proposed to filter out redundant information in both temporal sequences and spatial interactions. Finally, we design a multimodal decoder. Under the supervision of patch-level and point-level losses, we obtain reasonable trajectory results.

*Qingmei Li,Yang Zhang,Peifeng Zhang,Haohuan Fu,Juepeng Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAGE是一个在隐私约束下提升冻结模型泛化能力的风格自适应框架，通过合成视觉提示来隐式对齐跨风格特征分布，而非直接微调模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在真实场景中，由于隐私和安全约束，无法访问模型参数和架构细节，传统微调方法受限，需要不修改模型权重的输入级策略来提升泛化能力。

Method: 首先利用风格迁移构建源域的多样化风格表示，学习覆盖广泛视觉特征的风格特征集；然后根据每个输入的视觉上下文自适应融合这些风格线索，形成动态提示来协调图像外观。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，SAGE在隐私约束下达到或优于最先进方法，在所有设置中都优于全微调基线。

Conclusion: SAGE通过闭环设计有效弥合了冻结模型不变性与未见领域多样性之间的差距，为隐私约束下的语义分割域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain generalization for semantic segmentation aims to mitigate the degradation in model performance caused by domain shifts. However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \textbf{S}tyle-\textbf{A}daptive \textbf{GE}neralization framework (\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features. Then, the model adaptively fuses these style cues according to the visual context of each input, forming a dynamic prompt that harmonizes the image appearance without touching the interior of the model. Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that SAGE achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods under privacy constraints and outperforms full fine-tuning baselines in all settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了On-the-fly Feedback SfM框架，通过实时反馈机制优化无人机摄影测量，实现边采集边重建的智能工作流程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统离线无人机摄影测量无法满足灾害响应等时间敏感应用的需求，现有方法缺乏对实时3D重建质量的评估和采集指导反馈

Method: 基于SfM on-the-fly构建探索-利用框架，包含三个模块：在线增量粗网格生成、在线网格质量评估和预测性路径规划

Result: 实验表明该方法能实现近实时现场重建和评估，显著减少覆盖间隙和重复飞行成本

Conclusion: 该框架通过数据采集、处理、重建评估和在线反馈的集成，为传统被动工作模式向智能自适应探索工作流程的转变提供了替代方案

Abstract: Compared with conventional offline UAV photogrammetry, real-time UAV photogrammetry is essential for time-critical geospatial applications such as disaster response and active digital-twin maintenance. However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow. Code is now available at https://github.com/IRIS-LAB-whu/OntheflySfMFeedback.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FDTA提出了一种显式特征细化框架，通过空间适配器、时间适配器和身份适配器三个互补视角增强目标嵌入的判别性，解决端到端多目标跟踪中关联精度低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端多目标跟踪方法虽然检测性能强，但关联精度较低。研究发现共享DETR架构生成的目标嵌入具有过高相似性，仅关注单帧内的类别级区分，而跟踪需要跨帧的实例级区分和时空连续性。

Method: FDTA框架包含三个适配器：空间适配器（SA）集成深度感知线索实现空间连续性，时间适配器（TA）聚合历史信息实现时间依赖性，身份适配器（IA）利用质量感知对比学习实现实例级可分离性。

Result: 在DanceTrack、SportsMOT和BFT等多个挑战性MOT基准测试中，FDTA实现了最先进的性能，证明了所提出的判别性嵌入增强策略的有效性。

Conclusion: FDTA通过显式特征细化有效提升了端到端多目标跟踪的关联精度，为解决目标嵌入相似性过高问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需人工标注的相机引导雷达标注方法，通过将雷达点云投影到相机语义分割中并应用空间聚类，为4D雷达点云生成准确标签，解决了雷达语义分割领域数据集稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D雷达在恶劣天气条件下具有强大的环境感知潜力，但雷达语义分割研究受到开源数据集和标签稀缺的限制。RaDelft数据集虽然具有开创性，但仅提供LiDAR标注且无公开代码生成雷达标签，限制了研究的可重复性和下游应用。

Method: 采用相机引导的雷达标注管道，将雷达点云投影到基于相机的语义分割结果中，并应用空间聚类技术，无需依赖人工标注即可生成准确的雷达点云标签。

Result: 成功复现了RaDelft小组的数值结果，生成的雷达标签显著提高了标注精度，并建立了可重复的框架供研究社区训练和评估标注的4D雷达数据。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决雷达语义分割数据集稀缺问题提供了可行的技术路径，同时研究还量化了不同雾度水平对雷达标注性能的影响，为恶劣天气条件下的雷达感知研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D radar highlight its potential for robust environment perception under adverse conditions, yet progress in radar semantic segmentation remains constrained by the scarcity of open source datasets and labels. The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data. In addition, we study and quantify how different fog levels affect the radar labeling performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法将图像操作和网络搜索视为分离能力、过度依赖强化学习、缺乏基于实际工具执行轨迹的规划等问题。

Method: 使用少于30,000条高质量规划-执行一致轨迹进行监督微调，结合逐步一致性过滤验证，实现多模态规划、主动图像操作、深度多模态搜索和交替推理的统一。

Result: 在MMSearch和FVQA基准测试中分别获得66.1和67.2分，超越Gemini 2.5 Flash的所有11项指标，能够协调超过10个工具调用解决复杂多步骤任务。

Conclusion: 精心设计的监督学习单独即可实现复杂的代理多模态智能，无需依赖强化学习。

Abstract: Despite recent progress in multimodal agentic systems, existing approaches often treat image manipulation and web search as disjoint capabilities, rely heavily on costly reinforcement learning, and lack planning grounded in real tool-execution traces. To address these limitations, we present Skywork-R1V4, a 30B (A3B) parameter multimodal agentic model that unifies multimodal planning, active image manipulation ("thinking with images"), deep multimodal search, and, most critically, interleaved reasoning that dynamically alternates between visual operations and external knowledge retrieval. Trained solely via supervised fine-tuning on fewer than 30,000 high-quality, planning-execution-consistent trajectories and validated through stepwise consistency filtering, Skywork-R1V4 achieves state-of-the-art results across perception and multimodal search benchmarks: it scores 66.1 on MMSearch and 67.2 on FVQA, surpassing Gemini 2.5 Flash on all 11 metrics. Skywork-R1V4 exhibits emergent long-horizon reasoning at inference time, successfully orchestrating more than 10 tool calls to solve complex, multi-step tasks. Our results demonstrate that sophisticated agentic multimodal intelligence can be achieved through carefully curated supervised learning alone, without any reliance on reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Nav-R²通过明确建模关键关系和高效记忆机制，为开放词汇对象导航提供了透明且高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Object-goal navigation in open-vocabulary settings requires agents to locate novel objects in unseen environments, yet existing approaches suffer from opaque decision-making processes and low success rate on locating unseen objects. To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Conclusion: WISE框架能够有效利用异构专家的互补优势，在多模态推理任务中实现稳定性能提升，证明了多智能体辩论在多模态领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) are trained on diverse corpora and tasks, leading them to develop complementary strengths. Multi-agent debate (MAD) has emerged as a popular way to leverage these strengths for robust reasoning, though it has mostly been applied to language-only tasks, leaving its efficacy on multimodal problems underexplored. In this paper, we study MAD for solving vision-and-language reasoning problems. Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty. Our results show that WISE consistently improves accuracy by 2-7% over the state-of-the-art MAD setups and aggregation methods across diverse multimodal tasks and LLM configurations.

Conclusion: MitUNet为自动化3D重建管道中的数据准备提供了鲁棒工具，能够有效解决墙体分割中的几何精度问题

Abstract: Automatic 3D reconstruction of indoor spaces from 2D floor plans requires high-precision semantic segmentation of structural elements, particularly walls. However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models. MitUNet provides a robust tool for data preparation in automated 3D reconstruction pipelines.

Conclusion: 训练多个参数高效的专家模型比微调单一通用模型具有更好的泛化能力，GuiDG框架为视觉语言模型的领域泛化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) has emerged as a prevalent paradigm for downstream adaptation, yet it faces a critical trade-off between domain specificity and domain generalization (DG) ability. Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration. To better evaluate few-shot DG, we construct ImageNet-DG from ImageNet and its variants. Extensive experiments on standard DG benchmarks and ImageNet-DG demonstrate that GuiDG improves upon state-of-the-art fine-tuning methods while maintaining efficiency.

Abstract: With the rapid development of Large Vision Language Models, the focus of Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent tasks shifts from single-screen tasks to complex screen navigation challenges. However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.

Conclusion: WorldMM通过多模态记忆架构和自适应检索机制，有效提升了长视频推理能力，证明了其在处理小时级或天级长视频方面的有效性。

Abstract: Recent advances in video large language models have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding short clips. However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered. WorldMM significantly outperforms existing baselines across five long video question-answering benchmarks, achieving an average 8.4% performance gain over previous state-of-the-art methods, showing its effectiveness on long video reasoning.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的因果表征驱动方法为青光眼检测提供了更可靠、高效的解决方案，并为临床干预分析开辟了新途径。

Abstract: As a representative optic degenerative condition, glaucoma has been a threat to millions due to its irreversibility and severe impact on human vision fields. Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.

Conclusion: 该方法通过减少资源需求同时提升性能，推动了高效多模态学习的发展，特别适用于医疗等资源受限场景。

Abstract: In medical healthcare, obtaining detailed annotations is challenging, highlighting the need for robust Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time. Our approach aims to advance efficient multimodal learning by reducing resource requirements while improving performance over SOTA methods. The implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/phphuc612/MSD .

Motivation: 现有元学习方法需要额外的元训练阶段且成本高、不稳定，而大量任务特定预训练模型未被有效复用。BOLT旨在探索如何以最小额外训练将现有模型迁移到新任务。

Method: 离线阶段从多个任务向量提取主奇异方向并正交化形成可复用基；在线阶段冻结基，仅训练每层的小型对角系数，实现参数高效的秩控制更新。

Result: BOLT提供了无需训练的新任务强初始化，并在实验中相比常见PEFT基线和元学习初始化表现出稳健性能。

Conclusion: 将适应约束在任务信息正交子空间为未见任务迁移提供了有效替代方案。

Abstract: Adapting large pre-trained models to unseen tasks under tight data and compute budgets remains challenging. Meta-learning approaches explicitly learn good initializations, but they require an additional meta-training phase over many tasks, incur high training cost, and can be unstable. At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.

### [41] [Temporal Dynamics Enhancer for Directly Trained Spiking Object Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02447)
*Fan Luo,Zeyu Gao,Xinhao Luo,Kai Zhao,Yanfeng Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种称为时间动态增强器（TDE）的方法，通过增强SNN对时间信息建模的能力来解决现有SNN在复杂任务（如目标检测）中表达能力受限的问题。TDE包含两个模块：尖峰编码器（SE）生成多样化的时间步输入刺激，以及注意力门控模块（AGM）基于时间间依赖关系指导SE生成。此外，还提出了尖峰驱动注意力（SDA）来降低注意力相关的能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SNN通常直接复制输入或将其聚合为固定间隔的帧，导致神经元在时间步间接收几乎相同的刺激，严重限制了模型在复杂任务（如目标检测）中的表达能力。

Method: 提出TDE方法，包含两个模块：SE生成多样化时间步输入刺激，AGM基于时间间依赖关系指导SE生成。同时提出SDA来消除AGM引入的高能耗乘法操作。

Result: 实验表明TDE可无缝集成到现有SNN检测器中，在静态PASCAL VOC数据集上达到57.7%的mAP50-95，在神经形态EvDET200K数据集上达到47.6%。SDA能耗仅为传统注意力模块的0.240倍。

Conclusion: TDE有效增强了SNN的时间信息建模能力，在目标检测任务中优于现有方法，同时通过SDA显著降低了能耗。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), with their brain-inspired spatiotemporal dynamics and spike-driven computation, have emerged as promising energy-efficient alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset. In terms of energy consumption, the SDA consumes only 0.240 times the energy of conventional attention modules.

TL;DR: 本文提出了HouseLayout3D基准数据集和MultiFloor3D方法，旨在解决当前3D布局估计模型无法处理多楼层建筑的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D布局估计模型主要基于合成数据集训练，只能处理单个房间或单层环境，无法处理大型多楼层建筑，且需要将场景分割为单层处理，这移除了对连接多个楼层的结构（如楼梯）推理所必需的全局空间上下文。

Method: 提出了MultiFloor3D，一种无需训练的基线方法，利用最新的场景理解方法，能够处理多楼层建筑。

Result: MultiFloor3D在提出的基准数据集和现有数据集上均优于现有的3D布局估计模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了在建筑规模布局估计方向进一步研究的必要性，并提供了数据和代码支持。

Abstract: Current 3D layout estimation models are primarily trained on synthetic datasets containing simple single room or single floor environments. As a consequence, they cannot natively handle large multi floor buildings and require scenes to be split into individual floors before processing, which removes global spatial context that is essential for reasoning about structures such as staircases that connect multiple levels. In this work, we introduce HouseLayout3D, a real world benchmark designed to support progress toward full building scale layout estimation, including multiple floors and architecturally intricate spaces. We also present MultiFloor3D, a simple training free baseline that leverages recent scene understanding methods and already outperforms existing 3D layout estimation models on both our benchmark and prior datasets, highlighting the need for further research in this direction.

TL;DR: 本文提出ClusterStyle框架，通过聚类原型方法解决风格化动作生成中单一风格对应多样化动作变体的挑战，在全局和局部两个层面建模风格多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有风格化动作生成模型能够从风格动作中提取特定风格信息并插入内容动作，但难以捕捉风格内部的多样性（单一风格对应多样化动作变体）

Method: 提出基于聚类的ClusterStyle框架，使用原型集合建模同一风格类别中的多样化风格模式；构建全局和局部两个结构化风格嵌入空间，通过与非学习原型锚点对齐进行优化；使用风格调制适配器（SMA）增强预训练文本到动作生成模型

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在风格化动作生成和动作风格迁移任务上优于现有最先进模型

Conclusion: ClusterStyle框架有效解决了风格化动作生成中的风格多样性建模问题，通过原型学习和结构化嵌入空间实现了更好的性能

Abstract: Existing stylized motion generation models have shown their remarkable ability to understand specific style information from the style motion, and insert it into the content motion. However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences. These components jointly shape two structured style embedding spaces, i.e., global and local, optimized via alignment with non-learnable prototype anchors. Furthermore, we augment the pretrained text-to-motion generation model with the Stylistic Modulation Adapter (SMA) to integrate the style features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in stylized motion generation and motion style transfer.

TL;DR: 提出See-Think-Learn（STL）自训练框架，通过结构化推理模板和负向推理增强，提升视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力，无需依赖人工标注的高质量思维链数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在感知和推理方面存在短板，且增强推理能力通常需要依赖昂贵的人工标注或忽略感知的自我训练方法。

Method: STL框架引入'先看后想'的结构化推理模板，首先提取视觉属性文本，然后指导推理。通过自训练循环生成并学习结构化推理，并加入负向推理（解释错误选项为何不正确）来增强区分能力。

Result: 在多个领域的实验中，STL始终优于仅基于答案或自生成推理的基线方法，定性分析确认其推理质量较高。

Conclusion: STL为提升视觉语言模型的多模态推理能力提供了一种经济有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in integrating visual perception with language understanding. However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.

Motivation: 探索音频-视频联合去噪训练是否能够超越同步性，真正提升视频生成质量，即使生成目标仅为视频。

Method: 提出参数高效的AVFullDiT架构，利用预训练的文本到视频和文本到音频模块进行联合去噪训练。在相同设置下比较T2AV模型和仅T2V模型的性能。

Result: 实验首次系统证明音频-视频联合去噪能带来超越同步性的好处。在具有大运动和物体接触的挑战性子集上观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: 音频预测作为特权信号，鼓励模型内化视觉事件与其声学后果之间的因果关系，从而规范化视频动态。跨模态协同训练是开发更强、更物理基础世界模型的有前景方法。

Abstract: Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions. We hypothesize that predicting audio acts as a privileged signal, encouraging the model to internalize causal relationships between visual events and their acoustic consequences (e.g., collision $\times$ impact sound), which in turn regularizes video dynamics. Our findings suggest that cross-modal co-training is a promising approach to developing stronger, more physically grounded world models. Code and dataset will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有具身任务研究主要关注单任务场景，但在实际应用中，智能体需要处理顺序性任务，核心挑战是如何重用先前探索积累的空间知识来支持后续推理和探索。

Method: 提出了3DSPMR方法，利用已探索区域的关系、视觉和几何线索来增强多模态大语言模型，在顺序性具身任务中进行推理和探索。这是首个将几何信息显式融入MLLM空间理解的工作。

Result: 大量实验验证了3DSPMR在顺序EQA和EMN任务上取得了显著的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了具身AI中顺序任务的挑战，通过3D空间记忆推理方法有效提升了智能体在复杂环境中的表现，为实际应用提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Existing research on indoor embodied tasks typically requires agents to actively explore unknown environments and reason about the scene to achieve a specific goal. However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning. Extensive experiments verify that 3DSPMR achieves substantial performance gains on both sequential EQA and EMN tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布匹配方法在数据集蒸馏中忽略了训练过程中特征表示的演变，限制了合成数据的表达能力并削弱了下游性能。

Method: 提出轨迹引导数据集蒸馏(TGDD)，在每个训练阶段通过对齐合成数据集和原始数据集的特征分布来捕捉演化语义，同时引入分布约束正则化来减少类别重叠。

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验表明，TGDD实现了最先进的性能，特别是在高分辨率基准上实现了5.0%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: TGDD在不增加额外优化开销的情况下，在性能和效率之间取得了良好的平衡，能够保持语义多样性和代表性。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses large datasets into compact synthetic ones to reduce storage and computational costs. Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency. Experiments on ten datasets demonstrate that TGDD achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably a 5.0% accuracy gain on high-resolution benchmarks.

Result: 在专门评估长期一致性的Minecraft LoopNav基准测试中，WorldPack显著优于现有最先进的模型。

Conclusion: WorldPack通过压缩内存机制有效解决了视频世界模型中长期一致性的问题，为长时序视频生成提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Video world models have attracted significant attention for their ability to produce high-fidelity future visual observations conditioned on past observations and navigation actions. Temporally- and spatially-consistent, long-term world modeling has been a long-standing problem, unresolved with even recent state-of-the-art models, due to the prohibitively expensive computational costs for long-context inputs. In this paper, we propose WorldPack, a video world model with efficient compressed memory, which significantly improves spatial consistency, fidelity, and quality in long-term generation despite much shorter context length. Our compressed memory consists of trajectory packing and memory retrieval; trajectory packing realizes high context efficiency, and memory retrieval maintains the consistency in rollouts and helps long-term generations that require spatial reasoning. Our performance is evaluated with LoopNav, a benchmark on Minecraft, specialized for the evaluation of long-term consistency, and we verify that WorldPack notably outperforms strong state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: We propose G-SHARP, a commercially compatible, real-time surgical scene reconstruction framework designed for minimally invasive procedures that require fast and accurate 3D modeling of deformable tissue. While recent Gaussian splatting approaches have advanced real-time endoscopic reconstruction, existing implementations often depend on non-commercial derivatives, limiting deployability. G-SHARP overcomes these constraints by being the first surgical pipeline built natively on the GSplat (Apache-2.0) differentiable Gaussian rasterizer, enabling principled deformation modeling, robust occlusion handling, and high-fidelity reconstructions on the EndoNeRF pulling benchmark. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with strong speed-accuracy trade-offs suitable for intra-operative use. Finally, we provide a Holoscan SDK application that deploys G-SHARP on NVIDIA IGX Orin and Thor edge hardware, enabling real-time surgical visualization in practical operating-room settings.

TL;DR: UCAgents是一个分层多智能体框架，通过结构化证据审计实现单向收敛，解决医学视觉语言模型中的推理脱离问题，在四个医学VQA基准测试中达到71.3%的准确率，同时降低87.7%的token成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在医学诊断中存在推理脱离问题，即语言解释与可验证的图像证据脱节，削弱临床信任。多智能体框架虽能减轻单一模型偏见，但开放式讨论会放大文本噪声和计算成本，且未能将推理锚定在视觉证据上。

Method: 受临床工作流程启发，UCAgents禁止立场改变，限制智能体交互仅用于目标证据验证，抑制修辞漂移同时增强视觉信号提取。引入一轮询问讨论来发现视觉-文本错位的潜在风险，通过信息论形式化双噪声瓶颈。

Result: 在四个医学VQA基准测试中，UCAgents在PathVQA上达到71.3%的准确率（比最先进方法提升6.0%），token成本降低87.7%，在揭示更多视觉证据和避免混淆性文本干扰之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: UCAgents在诊断可靠性和计算效率方面表现出色，这对实际临床部署至关重要，证明了该框架在医学视觉语言模型中的有效性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show promise in medical diagnosis, yet suffer from reasoning detachment, where linguistically fluent explanations drift from verifiable image evidence, undermining clinical trust. Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

Motivation: 现有方法使用标准语言模型的因果注意力掩码，在3D场景理解中存在两个根本冲突：顺序无关3D对象的序列偏差和受限的对象-指令注意力，阻碍了任务特定推理。

Method: 提出3D-SLIM，用自适应注意力掩码替代因果掩码，包含几何自适应掩码（基于空间密度约束注意力）和指令感知掩码（使对象标记能直接访问指令上下文）。

Conclusion: 3D-SLIM证明了解码器设计在3D多模态推理中的关键作用，提供了一种简单有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D scene-language understanding have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D reasoning by transferring their general reasoning ability to 3D multi-modal contexts. However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and LLM baselines validate its effectiveness and underscore the critical role of decoder design in 3D multi-modal reasoning.

Abstract: While diffusion model for audio-driven avatar video generation have achieved notable process in synthesizing long sequences with natural audio-visual synchronization and identity consistency, the generation of music-performance videos with camera motions remains largely unexplored. We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Abstract: This study investigates the impact of the invariance of feature vectors for partial-to-partial point set registration under translation and rotation of input point sets, particularly in the realm of techniques based on deep learning and Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region. Owing to this, it significantly enhances the performance of DeepGMR and its recent variant, UGMMReg. Furthermore, these extension models outperform even prior deep learning methods using attention blocks and Transformer to extract the overlap region or common reference points.

TL;DR: MedSeg-TTA是一个全面的医学图像分割测试时适应基准测试，评估了20种代表性方法在7种成像模态下的性能，发现不同适应范式在不同条件下各有优劣。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学图像分割中的测试时适应方法评估存在模态覆盖不全、任务多样性不足和方法论不一致的问题，需要建立一个统一的基准测试来系统比较不同方法的可靠性和适用性。

Method: 建立了MedSeg-TTA基准测试，涵盖7种成像模态（MRI、CT、超声、病理、皮肤镜、OCT和胸片），在统一的数据预处理、骨干网络配置和测试时协议下评估20种代表性适应方法，包括四种主要适应范式：输入级变换、特征级对齐、输出级正则化和先验估计。

Result: 结果显示没有单一范式在所有条件下表现最佳。输入级方法在轻度外观变化下更稳定；特征级和输出级方法在边界相关指标上优势更大；基于先验的方法表现出强烈的模态依赖性。部分方法在大的跨中心和跨设备变化下性能显著下降。

Conclusion: MedSeg-TTA为医学图像分割的测试时适应研究提供了标准化数据集、验证实现和公开排行榜，强调了在临床部署中需要基于原则的方法选择，为未来开发鲁棒、临床可靠的测试时适应方法奠定了严格基础。

Abstract: Test time Adaptation is a promising approach for mitigating domain shift in medical image segmentation; however, current evaluations remain limited in terms of modality coverage, task diversity, and methodological consistency. We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment. MedSeg-TTA provides standardized datasets, validated implementations, and a public leaderboard, establishing a rigorous foundation for future research on robust, clinically reliable test-time adaptation. All source codes and open-source datasets are available at https://github.com/wenjing-gg/MedSeg-TTA.

Conclusion: dots.ocr证明了统一端到端框架在文档布局解析中的优势，为全球文档智能研究提供了强大基准，具有出色的多语言泛化能力。

Abstract: Document Layout Parsing serves as a critical gateway for Artificial Intelligence (AI) to access and interpret the world's vast stores of structured knowledge. This process,which encompasses layout detection, text recognition, and relational understanding, is particularly crucial for empowering next-generation Vision-Language Models. Current methods, however, rely on fragmented, multi-stage pipelines that suffer from error propagation and fail to leverage the synergies of joint training. In this paper, we introduce dots.ocr, a single Vision-Language Model that, for the first time, demonstrates the advantages of jointly learning three core tasks within a unified, end-to-end framework. This is made possible by a highly scalable data engine that synthesizes a vast multilingual corpus, empowering the model to deliver robust performance across a wide array of tasks, encompassing diverse languages, layouts, and domains. The efficacy of our unified paradigm is validated by state-of-the-art performance on the comprehensive OmniDocBench. Furthermore, to catalyze research in global document intelligence, we introduce XDocParse, a challenging new benchmark spanning 126 languages. On this testbed, dots.ocr establishes a powerful new baseline, outperforming the next-best competitor by a remarkable +7.4 point margin and proving its unparalleled multilingual capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型与地理空间理解的并行本质存在结构性错配，限制了结构化输出的生成能力。

Method: 将地理空间生成重新定义为并行细化过程，实现从粗到细的整体合成，同时解决所有语义元素。引入GeoDiT扩散模型。

Result: 在图像描述、视觉定位和多目标检测等任务上取得显著提升，特别是在自回归模型表现不佳的结构化输出任务上建立新标杆。

Conclusion: 生成过程与数据内在结构的对齐是解锁复杂地理空间分析优异性能的关键。

Abstract: Autoregressive models are structurally misaligned with the inherently parallel nature of geospatial understanding, forcing a rigid sequential narrative onto scenes and fundamentally hindering the generation of structured and coherent outputs. We challenge this paradigm by reframing geospatial generation as a parallel refinement process, enabling a holistic, coarse-to-fine synthesis that resolves all semantic elements simultaneously. To operationalize this, we introduce GeoDiT, the first diffusion-based vision-language model tailored for the geospatial domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GeoDiT establishes a new state-of-the-art on benchmarks requiring structured, object-centric outputs. It achieves significant gains in image captioning, visual grounding, and multi-object detection, precisely the tasks where autoregressive models falter. Our work validates that aligning the generative process with the data's intrinsic structure is key to unlocking superior performance in complex geospatial analysis.

TL;DR: 提出ViT-SR方法，通过两阶段训练策略提升视觉变换器在单图像超分辨率任务中的性能，首先进行自监督预训练，然后微调进行4倍超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像超分辨率在计算机视觉中仍是一个难题，需要探索更有效的训练策略来提升模型性能。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：1）自监督预训练阶段通过着色任务学习通用视觉表示；2）微调阶段预测高频残差图像叠加到双三次插值结果上，简化残差学习。

Result: 在DIV2K数据集上达到SSIM 0.712和PSNR 22.90 dB的优异结果。

Conclusion: 两阶段训练方法有效，自监督预训练在复杂图像恢复任务中具有潜力，更大ViT架构或替代预训练任务可能带来进一步改进。

Abstract: In computer vision, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) is still a difficult problem. We present ViT-SR, a new technique to improve the performance of a Vision Transformer (ViT) employing a two-stage training strategy. In our method, the model learns rich, generalizable visual representations from the data itself through a self-supervised pretraining phase on a colourization task. The pre-trained model is then adjusted for 4x super-resolution. By predicting the addition of a high-frequency residual image to an initial bicubic interpolation, this design simplifies residual learning. ViT-SR, trained and evaluated on the DIV2K benchmark dataset, achieves an impressive SSIM of 0.712 and PSNR of 22.90 dB. These results demonstrate the efficacy of our two-stage approach and highlight the potential of self-supervised pre-training for complex image restoration tasks. Further improvements may be possible with larger ViT architectures or alternative pretext tasks.

Abstract: The emergence of large vision-language models (VLMs) has significantly enhanced the efficiency and flexibility of geospatial interpretation. However, general-purpose VLMs remain suboptimal for remote sensing (RS) tasks. Existing geospatial VLMs typically adopt a unified modeling strategy and struggle to differentiate between task types and interpretation granularities, limiting their ability to balance local detail perception and global contextual understanding. In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning. We also construct MGRS-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple RS interpretation tasks and granularity levels, to evaluate generalization in complex scenarios. Extensive experiments on 21 public datasets demonstrate that SkyMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance across tasks, validating its adaptability, scalability, and superior multi-granularity understanding in remote sensing.

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation (AC/AS) aim to detect anomalous samples and regions without any training data, a capability increasingly crucial in industrial inspection and medical imaging. This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.
  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.
  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.
  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.
  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models. Together, this dissertation provides theoretical understanding and practical solutions for the zero-shot AC/AS problem.

Motivation: 现有方法使用固定数量的可学习查询令牌虽然计算高效，但存在任务泛化崩溃问题，无法适应与预训练任务差异较大的新任务。

Method: 提出Noisy Query Tokens方法，通过端到端优化在VLM和扩散模型之间学习分布式表示空间；引入带有线性投影的VAE分支来恢复细粒度图像细节。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够缓解泛化崩溃问题，并在多样化任务上实现稳定的持续学习。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了多模态大语言模型与扩散模型桥接中的泛化问题，支持跨任务的持续学习能力。

Abstract: Recent progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has highlighted the challenge of efficiently bridging pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with Diffusion Models. While methods using a fixed number of learnable query tokens offer computational efficiency, they suffer from task generalization collapse, failing to adapt to new tasks that are distant from their pre-training tasks. To overcome this, we propose Noisy Query Tokens, which learn a distributed representation space between the VLM and Diffusion Model via end-to-end optimization, enhancing continual learning. Additionally, we introduce a VAE branch with linear projection to recover fine-grained image details. Experimental results confirm our approach mitigates generalization collapse and enables stable continual learning across diverse tasks.

*Xianbing Sun,Zhikai Zhu,Zhengyu Lou,Bo Yang,Jinyang Tang,Liqing Zhang,He Wang,Jianfu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的两步加速方案，通过分析VGGT和π³模型中全局注意力模块的作用，将早期全局层转换为帧注意力，并对全局注意力进行子采样，实现了8-10倍的推理速度提升，同时保持或略微提高原始模型的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如VGGT和π³虽然在多视图3D性能上表现强劲，但其对全局自注意力的重度依赖导致计算成本高昂。现有的稀疏注意力变体只能提供部分加速，且缺乏对全局注意力在多视图推理中作用的系统性分析。

Method: 首先深入分析VGGT和π³中全局注意力模块的作用，发现交替全局帧架构中的角色分工：早期全局层不形成有意义的对应关系，中间层执行跨视图对齐，最后层仅提供微小改进。基于此提出两步加速方案：1）将早期全局层转换为帧注意力；2）通过对补丁标记进行K/V子采样来子采样全局注意力，保留对角线并包含均值填充组件。

Result: 在标准姿态和点云基准测试中，该方法实现了8-10倍的推理时间加速，同时匹配或略微提高了原始模型的精度，在极密集多视图设置下仍保持鲁棒性，而先前的稀疏注意力基线在此情况下会失败。

Conclusion: 通过系统性分析全局注意力在多视图推理中的作用，提出的训练免费加速方案能显著提升推理效率，同时保持模型性能，为多视图3D任务的实时应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Since DUSt3R, models such as VGGT and $π^3$ have shown strong multi-view 3D performance, but their heavy reliance on global self-attention results in high computational cost. Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $π^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $π^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks. Our method achieves up to $8$-$10\times$ speedup in inference time while matching or slightly improving the accuracy of the original models, and remains robust even in extremely dense multi-view settings where prior sparse-attention baselines fail.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) suffers from a lack of large-scale high-quality training data due to challenges in data privacy and annotation costs. While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models. We will open-source the full codebase, pretrained model, and the PersonSyn dataset.

Conclusion: Panel2Patch通过层次化数据挖掘和粒度感知训练，显著提升了生物医学视觉语言模型的表示能力，为细粒度医学图像理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in developing strong biomedical vision-language models. A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases. By applying Panel2Patch to only a small set of the literature figures, we extract far more effective supervision than prior pipelines, enabling substantially better performance with less pretraining data.

Abstract: Synthesizing synchronized and natural co-speech gesture videos remains a formidable challenge. Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.

Conclusion: 结合纹理映射的高斯溅射方法能够有效减少参数数量，同时保持高质量的渲染效果，为3D重建和实时渲染提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Splatting has become the method of choice for 3D reconstruction and real-time rendering of captured real scenes. However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.
  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

Conclusion: RULER-Bench将促进推理感知视频生成的进一步发展，推动视频生成模型向视觉基础智能迈进

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have enabled the synthesis of videos with strong temporal consistency and impressive visual quality, marking a crucial step toward vision foundation models. To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models. We expect that the insight obtained from RULER-Bench will facilitate further development of reasoning-aware video generation, advancing video generation models toward vision foundation intelligence.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试仅关注狭窄的子任务，而忽略了布局中心挑战，这些挑战是现实世界幻灯片创建和编辑的核心。PPTBench旨在填补这一空白，评估MLLMs在PowerPoint相关任务上的多模态推理和布局理解能力。

Method: 利用958个PPTX文件的多样化来源，PPTBench评估模型在四个类别中的表现：检测、理解、修改和生成。通过消融实验和进一步分析，研究当前MLLMs在结合视觉线索与JSON-based布局结构方面的能力。

Result: 实验揭示当前MLLMs在语义理解和视觉布局推理之间存在显著差距：模型能够解释幻灯片内容，但无法产生连贯的空间排列。MLLMs难以将视觉线索与JSON-based布局结构结合，并无法将视觉信息整合到其API规划能力中。案例研究视觉暴露了系统性布局错误，如错位和元素重叠。

Conclusion: 这些发现为在PPT场景中评估VLLMs提供了新的视角，突出了视觉结构推理和连贯幻灯片生成的挑战和未来研究方向。所有数据集和代码已完全发布，以支持可重复性和未来研究。

Abstract: PowerPoint presentations combine rich textual content with structured visual layouts, making them a natural testbed for evaluating the multimodal reasoning and layout understanding abilities of modern MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks focus solely on narrow subtasks while overlooking layout-centric challenges, which are central to real-world slide creation and editing. To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation. All datasets and code are fully released to support reproducibility and future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于基础模型的预训练策略，通过大规模模拟数据学习稳健的空间-光谱先验，以解决遥感图像融合中的跨域泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习遥感图像融合方法在未见数据集上泛化能力差，主要受限于真实训练数据有限和不同卫星传感器之间的域差异。

Method: 构建多样化模拟数据集（对ImageNet和SkyScript图像应用模糊、噪声、下采样等退化操作和增强技术），在不同网络架构上预训练融合模型，并在六个卫星数据集上评估零样本和单样本性能。

Result: 预训练策略显著提升了不同卫星传感器和成像条件下各种融合模型的泛化性能，在零样本场景下取得优异结果，在单样本设置中展现出卓越的适应能力。

Conclusion: 该工作为跨域全色锐化提供了实用解决方案，建立了遥感图像融合任务中泛化能力的新基准，为通过先进训练策略利用基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Existing deep learning methods for remote sensing image fusion often suffer from poor generalization when applied to unseen datasets due to the limited availability of real training data and the domain gap between different satellite sensors. To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings. Our work provides a practical solution for cross-domain pansharpening, establishes a new benchmark for generalization in remote sensing image fusion tasks, and paves the way for leveraging foundation models through advanced training strategies.

Abstract: We introduce PoreTrack3D, the first benchmark for dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting in pore-scale, non-rigid 3D facial trajectory tracking. It contains over 440,000 facial trajectories in total, among which more than 52,000 are longer than 10 frames, including 68 manually reviewed trajectories that span the entire 150 frames. To the best of our knowledge, PoreTrack3D is the first benchmark dataset to capture both traditional facial landmarks and pore-scale keypoints trajectory, advancing the study of fine-grained facial expressions through the analysis of subtle skin-surface motion. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting methods on PoreTrack3D, establishing the first performance baseline in this domain. Overall, the pipeline developed for this benchmark dataset's creation establishes a new framework for high-fidelity facial motion capture and dynamic 3D reconstruction.

*Junwon Lee,Juhan Nam,Jiyoung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的文本条件选择性视频到音频生成任务SelVA，能够从多对象视频中仅生成用户指定的目标声音，解决了现有方法只能生成混合音频的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多媒体制作中，音频轨道通常需要单独处理每个声源以实现精确编辑和创意控制，但现有方法只能一次性生成混合音频，无法根据文本提示选择特定声源。

Method: 提出SelVA模型，将文本提示作为目标声源的显式选择器，通过调节视频编码器提取与提示相关的视频特征，使用补充令牌抑制文本无关的激活，并采用自增强方案解决单声道音频监督数据缺乏的问题。

Result: 在VGG-MONOAUDIO基准测试上，SelVA在音频质量、语义对齐和时间同步方面表现出色，实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: SelVA为多媒体制作提供了更精确的音频生成能力，通过文本条件选择实现了目标声源的分离生成，具有重要的应用价值。

Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Code and demo are available at https://jnwnlee.github.io/selva-demo/.

*Agathoklis Georgiou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合架构，结合了视觉语言模型的语义理解和OCR系统的空间定位能力，用于文档检索中的精确区域定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型虽然能实现细粒度相似性计算，但只能返回整个页面而非特定区域；而OCR系统能提取文本坐标但缺乏语义相关性评估。这两种方法在检索增强生成中都有局限性。

Method: 使用ColPali的补丁级相似性得分作为空间相关性过滤器，应用于OCR提取的区域。通过建立视觉变换器补丁网格与OCR边界框之间的坐标映射，引入交集度量进行相关性传播，并在推理时无需额外训练即可运行。

Result: 开发了开源实现Snappy，展示了实际应用价值，实证评估正在进行中。

Conclusion: 该混合方法统一了两种范式，为检索增强生成提供了更精确的上下文定位能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like ColPali achieve state-of-the-art document retrieval by embedding pages as images and computing fine-grained similarity between query tokens and visual patches. However, they return entire pages rather than specific regions, limiting utility for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) where precise context is paramount. Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision. Our approach operates at inference time without additional training. We release Snappy, an open-source implementation demonstrating practical applicability, with empirical evaluation ongoing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PolarGuide-GSDR是一种将偏振先验嵌入3D高斯泼溅的框架，通过偏振与3DGS的双向耦合机制，实现高保真反射分离和全场景重建，无需环境贴图或材料假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如偏振感知NeRF训练慢、渲染效率低，而3DGS虽能实时渲染但难以准确重建反射，且添加延迟反射模块会引入环境贴图依赖。

Method: 提出偏振前向引导范式，建立偏振与3DGS的双向耦合：先用3DGS几何先验解决偏振歧义，再用精炼的偏振信息引导3DGS的法线和球谐表示。

Result: 在公开和自采数据集上，PolarGuide-GSDR在镜面反射重建、法线估计和新视角合成方面达到最先进性能，同时保持实时渲染能力。

Conclusion: 这是首个将偏振先验直接嵌入3DGS优化的框架，为复杂反射场景建模提供了卓越的可解释性和实时性能。

Abstract: Polarization-aware Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) enable novel view synthesis of specular-reflection scenes but face challenges in slow training, inefficient rendering, and strong dependencies on material/viewpoint assumptions. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering yet struggles with accurate reflection reconstruction from reflection-geometry entanglement, adding a deferred reflection module introduces environment map dependence. We address these limitations by proposing PolarGuide-GSDR, a polarization-forward-guided paradigm establishing a bidirectional coupling mechanism between polarization and 3DGS: first 3DGS's geometric priors are leveraged to resolve polarization ambiguity, and then the refined polarization information cues are used to guide 3DGS's normal and spherical harmonic representation. This process achieves high-fidelity reflection separation and full-scene reconstruction without requiring environment maps or restrictive material assumptions. We demonstrate on public and self-collected datasets that PolarGuide-GSDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in specular reconstruction, normal estimation, and novel view synthesis, all while maintaining real-time rendering capabilities. To our knowledge, this is the first framework embedding polarization priors directly into 3DGS optimization, yielding superior interpretability and real-time performance for modeling complex reflective scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反无人机跟踪研究缺乏统一框架，各模态独立建模，忽视了跨模态信息共享潜力，且多模态数据融合效果不佳。

Method: 基于单流单阶段端到端架构的UAUTrack框架，引入文本先验提示策略指导模型关注不同场景下的无人机目标。

Result: 在Anti-UAV、DUT Anti-UAV数据集上达到最先进性能，在Anti-UAV410数据集上保持精度与速度的良好平衡。

Conclusion: UAUTrack框架在多样化反无人机场景中展现出高精度和实用效率，为跨模态跟踪提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Research in Anti-UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) tracking has explored various modalities, including RGB, TIR, and RGB-T fusion. However, a unified framework for cross-modal collaboration is still lacking. Existing approaches have primarily focused on independent models for individual tasks, often overlooking the potential for cross-modal information sharing. Furthermore, Anti-UAV tracking techniques are still in their infancy, with current solutions struggling to achieve effective multimodal data fusion. To address these challenges, we propose UAUTrack, a unified single-target tracking framework built upon a single-stream, single-stage, end-to-end architecture that effectively integrates multiple modalities. UAUTrack introduces a key component: a text prior prompt strategy that directs the model to focus on UAVs across various scenarios. Experimental results show that UAUTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Anti-UAV and DUT Anti-UAV datasets, and maintains a favourable trade-off between accuracy and speed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset, demonstrating both high accuracy and practical efficiency across diverse Anti-UAV scenarios.

Conclusion: PGP-DiffSR成功地将渐进式剪枝方法和相位交换适配器模块统一到一个模型中，为轻量级扩散超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Although diffusion-based models have achieved impressive results in image super-resolution, they often rely on large-scale backbones such as Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) and Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which lead to excessive computational and memory costs during training and inference. To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves competitive restoration quality while significantly reducing computational load and memory consumption.

Motivation: 现有的基于槽注意力的物体中心表示学习方法在处理真实世界数据时，通常不加区分地处理前景和背景区域，导致背景干扰和实例发现性能不理想。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：第一阶段通过双槽竞争机制进行粗粒度场景分解区分前景背景；第二阶段引入掩码槽注意力机制，第一个槽捕获背景，其余槽竞争表示单个前景物体。还结合基于自监督图像特征的伪掩码指导来解决前景物体过分割问题。

Result: 在合成和真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，FASA始终优于最先进的方法，验证了显式前景建模和伪掩码指导对鲁棒场景分解和物体一致性表示的有效性。

Conclusion: FASA通过明确的前景-背景分离和伪掩码指导机制，显著提升了无监督物体发现性能，为鲁棒的场景分解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in object-centric representation learning have shown that slot attention-based methods can effectively decompose visual scenes into object slot representations without supervision. However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: One of the deadliest pandemics is now happening in the current world due to COVID-19. This contagious virus is spreading like wildfire around the whole world. To minimize the spreading of this virus, World Health Organization (WHO) has made protocols mandatory for wearing face masks and maintaining 6 feet physical distance. In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0. So, with this system, we can identify high-risk areas with the highest possibility of the virus spreading zone. This may help authorities to take necessary steps to locate those risky areas and alert the local people to ensure proper precautions in no time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常分割在自动驾驶中至关重要，但异常数据的稀缺性和有限多样性严重限制了模型在开放世界环境中的泛化能力。现有方法通过合成数据生成来缓解这一问题，但往往缺乏上下文一致性和物理真实性。

Method: 提出ClimaDrive框架，结合结构引导的多天气生成和提示驱动的异常修复，创建ClimaOoD基准数据集，涵盖六种代表性驾驶场景在清晰和恶劣天气条件下的数据。

Result: 在四种最先进方法上的实验表明，使用ClimaOoD训练显著提高了异常分割性能。AUROC、AP和FPR95均有显著提升，其中RbA在Fishyscapes LAF上的FPR95从3.97降至3.52。

Conclusion: ClimaOoD增强了模型鲁棒性，为开放世界异常检测提供了有价值的训练数据，实现了更好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Anomaly segmentation seeks to detect and localize unknown or out-of-distribution (OoD) objects that fall outside predefined semantic classes a capability essential for safe autonomous driving. However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation. Across all methods, AUROC, AP, and FPR95 show notable gains, with FPR95 dropping from 3.97 to 3.52 for RbA on Fishyscapes LAF. These results demonstrate that ClimaOoD enhances model robustness, offering valuable training data for better generalization in open-world anomaly detection.

Abstract: Domain adaptation in object detection is critical for real-world applications where distribution shifts degrade model performance. Security X-ray imaging presents a unique challenge due to variations in scanning devices and environmental conditions, leading to significant domain discrepancies. To address this, we apply ALDI++, a domain adaptation framework that integrates self-distillation, feature alignment, and enhanced training strategies to mitigate domain shift effectively in this area. We conduct extensive experiments on the EDS dataset, demonstrating that ALDI++ surpasses the state-of-the-art (SOTA) domain adaptation methods across multiple adaptation scenarios. In particular, ALDI++ with a Vision Transformer for Detection (ViTDet) backbone achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP), confirming the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures for cross-domain object detection. Additionally, our category-wise analysis highlights consistent improvements in detection accuracy, reinforcing the robustness of the model across diverse object classes. Our findings establish ALDI++ as an efficient solution for domain-adaptive object detection, setting a new benchmark for performance stability and cross-domain generalization in security X-ray imagery.

Motivation: 传统卫星中心的地理定位方法在高分辨率或最新卫星图像不可用时鲁棒性受限，且未能充分利用跨视图（如无人机、卫星、街景）和跨模态（如语言和图像）的互补信息。

Method: 提出GeoBridge基础模型，基于新颖的语义锚机制，通过文本描述桥接多视图特征；构建GeoLoc数据集（包含5万+无人机、街景、卫星图像对及文本描述，覆盖36个国家）。

Conclusion: GeoBridge通过语义锚机制和多模态对齐，突破了传统卫星中心定位的局限，为跨视图地理定位提供了更鲁棒和灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization infers a location by retrieving geo-tagged reference images that visually correspond to a query image. However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks. Experiments confirm that GeoLoc pre-training markedly improves geo-location accuracy for GeoBridge while promoting cross-domain generalization and cross-modal knowledge transfer. The dataset, source code, and pretrained models were released at https://github.com/MiliLab/GeoBridge.

Conclusion: VLM-Pruner通过平衡冗余性和空间稀疏性，有效解决了现有令牌剪枝方法的局限性，为移动设备部署提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at image understanding tasks, but the large number of visual tokens imposes significant computational costs, hindering deployment on mobile devices. Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens. We further adopt a parallel greedy strategy to conduct token selection efficiently. To mitigate information loss from pruning, we selectively fuse salient information from the discarded tokens into the retained ones. Comprehensive comparisons demonstrate that VLM-Pruner consistently outperforms strong baselines across five VLMs with an 88.9\% pruning rate, while delivering an end-to-end inference speedup.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于性别分层的全身MRI图像配准方法，使用VIBESegmentator生成的组织掩膜增强基于强度的图割配准，在UK Biobank数据上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决UK Biobank大规模全身MRI图像的主体间配准问题，实现全身空间标准化，便于进行区域/体素级别的非成像数据与图像衍生参数的相关性分析。

Method: 性别分层配准方法，利用皮下脂肪组织和肌肉组织的掩膜（来自VIBESegmentator）来增强基于强度的图割配准算法。

Result: 在4000名受试者上评估，平均Dice分数男性0.77/女性0.75，比仅基于强度的方法高6个百分点，比uniGradICON高8-9个百分点，比MIRTK高12-13个百分点。年龄相关性图谱更清晰且解剖对齐更好。

Conclusion: 使用两种组织掩膜的图像配准方法显著改善了UK Biobank全身图像的配准质量。

Abstract: The UK Biobank is a large-scale study collecting whole-body MR imaging and non-imaging health data. Robust and accurate inter-subject image registration of these whole-body MR images would enable their body-wide spatial standardization, and region-/voxel-wise correlation analysis of non-imaging data with image-derived parameters (e.g., tissue volume or fat content).
  We propose a sex-stratified inter-subject whole-body MR image registration approach that uses subcutaneous adipose tissue- and muscle-masks from the state-of-the-art VIBESegmentator method to augment intensity-based graph-cut registration. The proposed method was evaluated on a subset of 4000 subjects by comparing it to an intensity-only method as well as two previously published registration methods, uniGradICON and MIRTK. The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.
  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK. Using the proposed method, the age-correlation maps were less noisy and showed higher anatomical alignment.
  In conclusion, the image registration method using two tissue masks improves whole-body registration of UK Biobank images.

TL;DR: GeoViS是一个地理空间奖励视觉搜索框架，通过渐进式搜索推理过程解决遥感图像中的视觉定位挑战，特别针对小目标和复杂空间关系问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉定位方面取得显著进展，但应用于遥感图像时面临挑战：目标在千米级场景中极小，查询涉及复杂的相对位置、空间层次和远距离对象依赖关系。

Method: 将遥感视觉定位重新定义为渐进式搜索推理过程，通过树状结构的视觉线索序列主动探索全局图像，整合多模态感知、空间推理和奖励引导探索来迭代优化地理空间假设。

Result: 在五个遥感定位基准测试上的广泛实验表明，GeoViS实现了精确的地理空间理解，在关键视觉定位指标上持续超越现有方法。

Conclusion: GeoViS框架在保持整体场景感知的同时能够检测微小目标，展示了强大的跨域泛化能力和可解释性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models(MLLMs) have led to remarkable progress in visual grounding, enabling fine-grained cross-modal alignment between textual queries and image regions. However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness. Extensive experiments on five remote sensing grounding benchmarks demonstrate that GeoViS achieves precise geospatial understanding and consistently surpasses existing methods across key visual grounding metrics, highlighting its strong cross-domain generalization and interpretability.

*Yifan Zhou,Takehiko Ohkawa,Guwenxiao Zhou,Kanoko Goto,Takumi Hirose,Yusuke Sekikawa,Nakamasa Inoue*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Deformable Mamba（DF-Mamba）的新型视觉特征提取框架，用于解决3D手部姿态估计中因严重遮挡（如双手重叠）导致的特征学习困难问题。该框架通过状态空间建模和可变形状态扫描技术，有效捕捉全局上下文信息，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D手部姿态估计方法在处理严重遮挡图像时存在局限性，主要因为ResNet等CNN架构的归纳偏置限制了全局上下文建模能力。双手重叠等复杂遮挡场景需要更有效地学习局部图像特征与全局上下文之间的关系。

Method: 提出DF-Mamba框架，结合状态空间建模（Mamba）和可变形状态扫描技术。通过选择性状态建模和可变形扫描，在卷积后的局部特征基础上聚合图像特征，同时选择性保留代表全局上下文的有用线索。

Result: 在五个不同数据集上的广泛评估表明，DF-Mamba在单双手场景、手部交互和手物交互、RGB和深度估计等任务中均优于最新图像骨干网络（包括VMamba和Spatial-Mamba），推理速度与ResNet-50相当。

Conclusion: DF-Mamba框架通过改进的全局上下文建模能力，显著提升了结构化3D手部姿态估计的准确性，为解决严重遮挡问题提供了有效解决方案，在多个复杂场景下实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context. This approach significantly improves the accuracy of structured 3D HPE, with comparable inference speed to ResNet-50. Our experiments involve extensive evaluations on five divergent datasets including single-hand and two-hand scenarios, hand-only and hand-object interactions, as well as RGB and depth-based estimation. DF-Mamba outperforms the latest image backbones, including VMamba and Spatial-Mamba, on all datasets and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需无人机图像训练的图像定位方法CAEVL，通过卫星图像模拟无人机视角进行训练，在GNSS受限环境中实现高效定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法需要大规模配对无人机-卫星数据集进行训练的问题，这种数据获取成本高且通常不可用，限制了应用范围。

Method: 采用直接从卫星视图参考图像学习的训练范式，通过专门的增强策略模拟卫星和真实世界无人机视图之间的视觉域偏移，提出CAEVL高效模型。

Result: 在ViLD新数据集上验证，相比需要配对数据训练的方法，取得了具有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了有效性和强大的泛化能力，为GNSS受限环境中的无人机自主导航提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种推理感知的多模态融合框架RAMF，通过局部-全局上下文融合和语义交叉注意力机制解决多模态语义融合问题，并引入对抗性推理过程来增强对细微仇恨内容的理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线视频中的仇恨言论日益严重，现有方法难以有效融合多模态间的复杂语义关系，且缺乏对细微仇恨内容的理解能力。

Method: 设计了局部-全局上下文融合(LGCF)捕捉局部显著线索和全局时间结构，提出语义交叉注意力(SCA)实现细粒度多模态语义交互，并引入对抗性推理过程（包含客观描述、仇恨假设推理和非仇恨假设推理三个阶段）。

Result: 在两个真实世界仇恨视频数据集上的评估显示，该方法在Macro-F1和仇恨类别召回率上分别比最先进方法提高了3%和7%。

Conclusion: RAMF框架在仇恨言论检测方面表现出强大的泛化性能，为解决多模态仇恨内容识别问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Hate speech in online videos is posing an increasingly serious threat to digital platforms, especially as video content becomes increasingly multimodal and context-dependent. Existing methods often struggle to effectively fuse the complex semantic relationships between modalities and lack the ability to understand nuanced hateful content. To address these issues, we propose an innovative Reasoning-Aware Multimodal Fusion (RAMF) framework. To tackle the first challenge, we design Local-Global Context Fusion (LGCF) to capture both local salient cues and global temporal structures, and propose Semantic Cross Attention (SCA) to enable fine-grained multimodal semantic interaction. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce adversarial reasoning-a structured three-stage process where a vision-language model generates (i) objective descriptions, (ii) hate-assumed inferences, and (iii) non-hate-assumed inferences-providing complementary semantic perspectives that enrich the model's contextual understanding of nuanced hateful intent. Evaluations on two real-world hateful video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves robust generalisation performance, improving upon state-of-the-art methods by 3% and 7% in Macro-F1 and hate class recall, respectively. We will release the code after the anonymity period ends.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AttMetNet是一个基于注意力增强深度学习框架的甲烷羽流检测方法，利用Sentinel-2卫星图像，通过结合NDMI指数和注意力机制U-Net网络，显著提升了甲烷检测的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲烷是强效温室气体，准确检测甲烷排放对应对气候变化至关重要。传统方法依赖波段差异分析，但存在大量误报；现有深度学习方法缺乏对甲烷特异性特征的优先关注机制。

Method: 提出AttMetNet框架，融合归一化甲烷指数(NDMI)和注意力增强U-Net网络，采用焦点损失函数解决类别不平衡问题，并在真实甲烷羽流数据集上进行训练。

Result: 实验表明AttMetNet在甲烷羽流检测方面优于现有方法，具有更低的误报率、更好的精确率-召回率平衡以及更高的IoU指标。

Conclusion: AttMetNet首次建立了针对真实卫星图像中甲烷羽流检测的专用架构，通过注意力机制和NDMI的协同作用，有效提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Methane is a powerful greenhouse gas that contributes significantly to global warming. Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery. Additionally, we employ focal loss to address the severe class imbalance arising from both limited positive plume samples and sparse plume pixels within imagery. Furthermore, AttMetNet is trained on the real methane plume dataset, making it more robust to practical scenarios. Extensive experiments show that AttMetNet surpasses recent methods in methane plume detection with a lower false positive rate, better precision recall balance, and higher IoU.

TL;DR: 提出了首个烟雾类型感知的腹腔镜视频去烟网络STANet，通过识别扩散烟雾和环境烟雾两种类型，实现更精准的视频去烟效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去烟方法未能考虑不同类型烟雾的时空特性差异，导致去烟效果不理想。手术烟雾会遮挡腹腔镜视频视野，影响手术导航。

Method: 设计烟雾掩码分割子网络进行烟雾类型预测，通过注意力加权掩码聚合；构建无烟视频重建子网络进行针对性去烟；引入粗到细解缠模块处理两种烟雾的纠缠问题。

Result: 在质量评估中优于现有最优方法，并在多个下游手术任务中表现出优越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: STANet通过烟雾类型感知的方法有效解决了腹腔镜视频去烟问题，为手术导航提供了更好的视觉支持。

Abstract: Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in quality evaluations, but also exhibits superior generalization across multiple downstream surgical tasks.

Motivation: 解决现有方法在联合生成多个场景内在属性时缺乏结构一致性和物理一致性的问题，提供更全面的场景描述。

Method: 提出两个关键技术：1）查询广播注意力机制，通过共享查询确保结构一致性；2）张量LoRA，参数高效地建模跨图关系以实现高效联合训练。

Result: 实验表明LumiX在一致性和物理意义方面表现优异，相比现有技术对齐度提高23%，偏好得分从-0.41提升到0.19。

Conclusion: LumiX框架能够稳定地进行联合扩散训练，统一生成多个内在属性，并在同一框架内支持图像条件的内在分解任务。

Abstract: We present LumiX, a structured diffusion framework for coherent text-to-intrinsic generation. Conditioned on text prompts, LumiX jointly generates a comprehensive set of intrinsic maps (e.g., albedo, irradiance, normal, depth, and final color), providing a structured and physically consistent description of an underlying scene. This is enabled by two key contributions: 1) Query-Broadcast Attention, a mechanism that ensures structural consistency by sharing queries across all maps in each self-attention block. 2) Tensor LoRA, a tensor-based adaptation that parameter-efficiently models cross-map relations for efficient joint training. Together, these designs enable stable joint diffusion training and unified generation of multiple intrinsic properties. Experiments show that LumiX produces coherent and physically meaningful results, achieving 23% higher alignment and a better preference score (0.19 vs. -0.41) compared to the state of the art, and it can also perform image-conditioned intrinsic decomposition within the same framework.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrackNetV5通过引入运动方向解耦模块和残差驱动的时空细化头，解决了前代版本在遮挡处理和运动方向模糊方面的问题，在TrackNetV2数据集上实现了新的SOTA性能，F1分数达到0.9859，准确率0.9733。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TrackNet系列存在显著局限性：V1-V3依赖纯视觉线索难以应对遮挡问题；TrackNetV4虽然引入运动输入但存在方向模糊问题，其绝对差分方法丢失了运动极性信息。

Method: 1. 运动方向解耦模块：将时间动态分解为带符号的极性场，显式编码运动发生和轨迹方向；2. 残差驱动的时空细化头：基于Transformer的粗到细范式，利用分解的时空上下文估计校正残差，有效恢复被遮挡目标。

Result: 在TrackNetV2数据集上的实验显示，TrackNetV5达到新的SOTA性能：F1分数0.9859，准确率0.9733，显著优于前代版本。与V4相比仅增加3.7%的FLOPs，保持实时推理能力。

Conclusion: TrackNetV5通过创新的方向感知运动建模和遮挡恢复机制，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了快速移动小物体跟踪的性能，为体育分析等应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.

Conclusion: 该工作为解决多模态模型训练数据稀缺和评估不足的问题提供了有效方案，为未来研究指明了清晰方向。

Abstract: With the rapid advances of powerful multimodal models such as GPT-4o, Nano Banana, and Seedream 4.0 in Image Editing, the performance gap between closed-source and open-source models is widening, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data and comprehensive benchmarks capable of diagnosing model weaknesses across diverse editing behaviors. Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \textit{Reasoning Accuracy}. Our analysis of mainstream models on UnicBench reveals their limitations and provides clear directions for future research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了视频和文本模态之间的信息密度差异，导致修改主题指代模糊和详细语义关注有限的问题，影响组合视频检索的性能。

Method: HUD框架包含三个关键组件：整体代词消歧、原子不确定性建模和整体到原子对齐，通过跨模态交互实现有效的对象消歧和详细语义关注。

Result: HUD在三个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能，不仅适用于组合视频检索，也适用于组合图像检索任务。

Conclusion: HUD是首个利用视频和文本信息密度差异来增强多模态查询理解的框架，通过分层不确定性建模有效解决了组合检索中的关键问题。

Abstract: Composed Video Retrieval (CVR) is a challenging video retrieval task that utilizes multi-modal queries, consisting of a reference video and modification text, to retrieve the desired target video. The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks. The codes are available on https://zivchen-ty.github.io/HUD.github.io/.

Method: 提出IC-World框架，利用大视频模型的上下文生成能力进行并行视频生成；通过强化学习（Group Relative Policy Optimization）和两个新提出的奖励模型（场景级几何一致性和物体级运动一致性）进行微调。

Result: 大量实验表明，IC-World在几何一致性和运动一致性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个系统探索基于视频的世界模型中共享世界建模问题的工作，IC-World框架在保持多视频一致性方面表现出色。

Abstract: Video-based world models have recently garnered increasing attention for their ability to synthesize diverse and dynamic visual environments. In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models. We further finetune IC-World via reinforcement learning, Group Relative Policy Optimization, together with two proposed novel reward models to enforce scene-level geometry consistency and object-level motion consistency among the set of generated videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IC-World substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both geometry and motion consistency. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically explore the shared world modeling problem with video-based world models.

TL;DR: 该研究首次系统性地研究了印度和南亚人脸的IP-AIGC检测，发现现有检测器在身份保持的AI生成内容上存在泛化问题，特别是在对印度人群的检测性能上表现出明显下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代图像编辑器可以生成身份保持的AI生成内容（IP-AIGC），但现有检测器在这种情况下的鲁棒性和公平性尚不清楚，特别是对于代表性不足的人群。

Method: 构建了印度人脸的训练集和两个IP-AIGC测试集，使用商业生成器（Gemini和ChatGPT）生成身份保持的内容，评估了AIDE和Effort两种检测器在预训练和微调模式下的性能。

Result: 微调虽然能在域内获得显著提升（如Effort AUC从0.739提升到0.944），但在印度人群的IP-AIGC测试集上性能明显下降（如AIDE AUC从0.923下降到0.563），表明检测器过度拟合了训练生成器的特征。

Conclusion: 研究确立了IP-AIGC-Indian作为一个具有挑战性的实际场景，需要开发保持表示能力的适应方法和印度感知的基准数据集来弥补检测器的泛化差距。

Abstract: Modern image editors can produce identity-preserving AIGC (IP-AIGC), where the same person appears with new attire, background, or lighting. The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift. Our study establishes IP-AIGC-Indian as a challenging and practically relevant scenario and motivates representation-preserving adaptation and India-aware benchmark curation to close generalization gaps in AIGC detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了PhyCustom框架，通过两种新的正则化损失来激活扩散模型进行物理概念定制，解决现有方法在物理属性定制上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的文本到图像定制方法在具体概念（如风格和形状）上取得了成功，但在物理概念定制方面表现不佳，主要原因是训练过程中缺乏明确的物理知识引入。

Method: 提出PhyCustom微调框架，包含两种新颖的正则化损失：等距损失（激活扩散模型学习物理概念）和解耦损失（消除独立概念的混合学习）。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，PhyCustom在物理概念定制方面在定量和定性上都优于现有的最先进和流行方法。

Conclusion: PhyCustom通过引入物理知识有效提升了扩散模型对物理属性的理解和生成能力，为物理概念定制提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Recent diffusion-based text-to-image customization methods have achieved significant success in understanding concrete concepts to control generation processes, such as styles and shapes. However, few efforts dive into the realistic yet challenging customization of physical concepts. The core limitation of current methods arises from the absence of explicitly introducing physical knowledge during training. Even when physics-related words appear in the input text prompts, our experiments consistently demonstrate that these methods fail to accurately reflect the corresponding physical properties in the generated results. In this paper, we propose PhyCustom, a fine-tuning framework comprising two novel regularization losses to activate diffusion model to perform physical customization. Specifically, the proposed isometric loss aims at activating diffusion models to learn physical concepts while decouple loss helps to eliminate the mixture learning of independent concepts. Experiments are conducted on a diverse dataset and our benchmark results demonstrate that PhyCustom outperforms previous state-of-the-art and popular methods in terms of physical customization quantitatively and qualitatively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨对抗训练是否无意中增加了对抗样本的可迁移性，这一问题在现有研究中尚未充分探索。

Method: 训练了36个不同的模型（包括CNN和ViT），并进行了全面的可迁移性实验。

Result: 对抗训练模型产生的扰动比标准模型更有效地迁移，揭示了明显的悖论。

Conclusion: 稳健性评估不仅应评估模型对迁移攻击的抵抗力，还应评估其产生可迁移对抗样本的倾向性。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved great success in computer vision, but remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Adversarial training is the leading defense designed to improve model robustness. However, its effect on the transferability of attacks is underexplored. In this work, we ask whether adversarial training unintentionally increases the transferability of adversarial examples. To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk. To enable reproducibility and further study, we release all models, code, and experimental scripts. Furthermore, we argue that robustness evaluations should assess not only the resistance of a model to transferred attacks but also its propensity to produce transferable adversarial examples.

Conclusion: ReVSeg通过显式分解推理过程和强化学习优化，不仅提升了视频对象分割的性能，还提供了透明的推理链，为复杂推理任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-centric video object segmentation is an inherently complex task: the query often refers to dynamics, causality, and temporal interactions, rather than static appearances. Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

Method: 提出AAG方法，结合单帧RGB特征和深度线索进行空间推理，并通过文本摘要或单帧动作识别器提供长期上下文信息。

Result: 在三个教学活动数据集（IKEA-ASM、Meccano和Assembly101）上，AAG的性能与基于时间聚合的视频基线和最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 多模态单帧动作预测方法AAG能够有效替代传统的视频聚合方法，展示了仅基于单帧信息进行动作预测的可行性。

Abstract: Anticipating actions before they occur is a core challenge in action understanding research. While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer. Our results demonstrate that multimodal single-frame action anticipation using AAG can perform competitively compared to both temporally aggregated video baselines and state-of-the-art methods across three instructional activity datasets: IKEA-ASM, Meccano, and Assembly101.

Abstract: Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scanning (IOS) are essential for digital dentistry, but annotated data scarcity limits automated solutions for pulp canal segmentation and cross-modal registration. To benchmark semi-supervised learning (SSL) in this domain, we organized the STSR 2025 Challenge at MICCAI 2025, featuring two tasks: (1) semi-supervised segmentation of teeth and pulp canals in CBCT, and (2) semi-supervised rigid registration of CBCT and IOS. We provided 60 labeled and 640 unlabeled IOS samples, plus 30 labeled and 250 unlabeled CBCT scans with varying resolutions and fields of view. The challenge attracted strong community participation, with top teams submitting open-source deep learning-based SSL solutions. For segmentation, leading methods used nnU-Net and Mamba-like State Space Models with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization, achieving a Dice score of 0.967 and Instance Affinity of 0.738 on the hidden test set. For registration, effective approaches combined PointNetLK with differentiable SVD and geometric augmentation to handle modality gaps; hybrid neural-classical refinement enabled accurate alignment despite limited labels.

Abstract: Recent advances in video diffusion models have remarkably improved camera-controlled video generation, but most methods rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), leaving online reinforcement learning (RL) post-training largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses. The reward function then compares each generated-reference segment pair and assigns an alignment score as the reward signal, which helps alleviate reward sparsity and improve optimization efficiency. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive dataset featuring diverse large-amplitude camera motions and scenes with varied subject dynamics. Extensive experiments show that our online RL post-training clearly outperforms SFT baselines across multiple aspects, including camera-control accuracy, geometric consistency, and visual quality, demonstrating its superiority in advancing camera-controlled video generation.

Abstract: We present MindGPT-4ov, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that introduces a general post-training paradigm spanning data production, model training, and efficient deployment. It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment. MindGPT-4ov provides a general post-training paradigm applicable to a wide range of MLLMs. The model weights, datasets, and code for the Qwen3-VL-based variants will be recently open-sourced to support the community's development of MLLMs.

Conclusion: 通过相位感知的LoRA适配器策略，实现了高效加速和强泛化，为扩散模型的实际部署提供了轻量级解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.

Abstract: Understanding high-resolution images remains a significant challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects. Furthermore, to achieve direct localization of target objects at a global scale, we introduce an open-vocalbulary object detection (OVD) model that identifies object regions using a sliding-window approach.Experiments on high-resolution image understanding benchmarks using different MLLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the underexplored challenge of sample diversity in autoregressive (AR) generative models with bitwise visual tokenizers. We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DiverseAR substantially improves sample diversity in bitwise autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) is crucial in computer vision and graphics, with wide applications in AR, VR, and autonomous driving. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) enables real-time rendering with high appearance fidelity, it suffers from multi-view inconsistencies, limiting geometric accuracy. In contrast, 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) enforces multi-view consistency but compromises texture details. To address these limitations, we propose Exchangeable Gaussian Splatting (EGGS), a hybrid representation that integrates 2D and 3D Gaussians to balance appearance and geometry. To achieve this, we introduce Hybrid Gaussian Rasterization for unified rendering, Adaptive Type Exchange for dynamic adaptation between 2D and 3D Gaussians, and Frequency-Decoupled Optimization that effectively exploits the strengths of each type of Gaussian representation. Our CUDA-accelerated implementation ensures efficient training and inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EGGS outperforms existing methods in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and efficiency, providing a practical solution for high-quality NVS.

Abstract: Text-guided video editing, particularly for object removal and addition, remains a challenging task due to the need for precise spatial and temporal consistency. Existing methods often rely on auxiliary masks or reference images for editing guidance, which limits their scalability and generalization. To address these issues, we propose LoVoRA, a novel framework for mask-free video object removal and addition using object-aware localization mechanism. Our approach utilizes a unique dataset construction pipeline that integrates image-to-video translation, optical flow-based mask propagation, and video inpainting, enabling temporally consistent edits. The core innovation of LoVoRA is its learnable object-aware localization mechanism, which provides dense spatio-temporal supervision for both object insertion and removal tasks. By leveraging a Diffusion Mask Predictor, LoVoRA achieves end-to-end video editing without requiring external control signals during inference. Extensive experiments and human evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness and high-quality performance of LoVoRA.

Abstract: The next frontier for video generation lies in developing models capable of zero-shot reasoning, where understanding real-world scientific laws is crucial for accurate physical outcome modeling under diverse conditions.

We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Abstract: We present Layout Anything, a transformer-based framework for indoor layout estimation that adapts the OneFormer's universal segmentation architecture to geometric structure prediction. Our approach integrates OneFormer's task-conditioned queries and contrastive learning with two key modules: (1) a layout degeneration strategy that augments training data while preserving Manhattan-world constraints through topology-aware transformations, and (2) differentiable geometric losses that directly enforce planar consistency and sharp boundary predictions during training. By unifying these components in an end-to-end framework, the model eliminates complex post-processing pipelines while achieving high-speed inference at 114ms. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, with pixel error (PE) of 5.43% and corner error (CE) of 4.02% on the LSUN, PE of 7.04% (CE 5.17%) on the Hedau and PE of 4.03% (CE 3.15%) on the Matterport3D-Layout datasets. The framework's combination of geometric awareness and computational efficiency makes it particularly suitable for augmented reality applications and large-scale 3D scene reconstruction tasks.

Abstract: In low-light environments like nighttime driving, image degradation severely challenges in-vehicle camera safety. Since existing enhancement algorithms are often too computationally intensive for vehicular applications, we propose UltraFast-LieNET, a lightweight multi-scale shifted convolutional network for real-time low-light image enhancement. We introduce a Dynamic Shifted Convolution (DSConv) kernel with only 12 learnable parameters for efficient feature extraction. By integrating DSConv with varying shift distances, a Multi-scale Shifted Residual Block (MSRB) is constructed to significantly expand the receptive field. To mitigate lightweight network instability, a residual structure and a novel multi-level gradient-aware loss function are incorporated. UltraFast-LieNET allows flexible parameter configuration, with a minimum size of only 36 parameters. Results on the LOLI-Street dataset show a PSNR of 26.51 dB, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.6 dB while utilizing only 180 parameters. Experiments across four benchmark datasets validate its superior balance of real-time performance and enhancement quality under limited resources.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的图像中心攻击方法CIA，通过多智能体系统将有害查询嵌入看似良性的视觉上下文中，显著提升了针对多模态大语言模型的越狱攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型安全对齐容易受到越狱攻击，但现有方法主要关注文本-图像交互，将视觉模态视为次要提示，未能充分利用图像承载复杂上下文信息的独特潜力。

Method: 提出Contextual Image Attack (CIA)方法，使用多智能体系统通过四种不同的可视化策略将有害查询嵌入视觉上下文，并采用上下文元素增强和自动毒性混淆技术提升攻击效果。

Result: 在MMSafetyBench-tiny数据集上的实验结果显示，CIA对GPT-4o和Qwen2.5-VL-72B模型的毒性分数分别达到4.73和4.83，攻击成功率分别达到86.31%和91.07%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 视觉模态本身是越狱先进多模态大语言模型的强有力攻击向量，CIA方法证明了图像中心攻击的有效性。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their safety alignments are susceptible to jailbreak attacks. Existing attack methods typically focus on text-image interplay, treating the visual modality as a secondary prompt. This approach underutilizes the unique potential of images to carry complex, contextual information. To address this gap, we propose a new image-centric attack method, Contextual Image Attack (CIA), which employs a multi-agent system to subtly embeds harmful queries into seemingly benign visual contexts using four distinct visualization strategies. To further enhance the attack's efficacy, the system incorporate contextual element enhancement and automatic toxicity obfuscation techniques. Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\% and 91.07\%. Our method significantly outperforms prior work, demonstrating that the visual modality itself is a potent vector for jailbreaking advanced MLLMs.

Conclusion: InEx框架有效缓解了多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题，无需额外训练即可显著提升模型可靠性。

Abstract: Hallucination remains a critical challenge in large language models (LLMs), hindering the development of reliable multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.

Abstract: Despite significant progress in 3D object detection, point clouds remain challenging due to sparse data, incomplete structures, and limited semantic information. Capturing contextual relationships between distant objects presents additional difficulties. To address these challenges, we propose GraphFusion3D, a unified framework combining multi-modal fusion with advanced feature learning. Our approach introduces the Adaptive Cross-Modal Transformer (ACMT), which adaptively integrates image features into point representations to enrich both geometric and semantic information. For proposal refinement, we introduce the Graph Reasoning Module (GRM), a novel mechanism that models neighborhood relationships to simultaneously capture local geometric structures and global semantic context. The module employs multi-scale graph attention to dynamically weight both spatial proximity and feature similarity between proposals. We further employ a cascade decoder that progressively refines detections through multi-stage predictions. Extensive experiments on SUN RGB-D (70.6\% AP$_{25}$ and 51.2\% AP$_{50}$) and ScanNetV2 (75.1\% AP$_{25}$ and 60.8\% AP$_{50}$) demonstrate a substantial performance improvement over existing approaches.

Abstract: Prevailing 3D texture generation methods, which often rely on multi-view fusion, are frequently hindered by inter-view inconsistencies and incomplete coverage of complex surfaces, limiting the fidelity and completeness of the generated content. To overcome these challenges, we introduce TEXTRIX, a native 3D attribute generation framework for high-fidelity texture synthesis and downstream applications such as precise 3D part segmentation. Our approach constructs a latent 3D attribute grid and leverages a Diffusion Transformer equipped with sparse attention, enabling direct coloring of 3D models in volumetric space and fundamentally avoiding the limitations of multi-view fusion. Built upon this native representation, the framework naturally extends to high-precision 3D segmentation by training the same architecture to predict semantic attributes on the grid. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both tasks, producing seamless, high-fidelity textures and accurate 3D part segmentation with precise boundaries.

Conclusion: DynamicVerse框架能够有效解决现有数据集的局限性，为理解动态物理世界提供了更全面的4D建模解决方案，在多个基准任务上优于现有方法。

Abstract: Understanding the dynamic physical world, characterized by its evolving 3D structure, real-world motion, and semantic content with textual descriptions, is crucial for human-agent interaction and enables embodied agents to perceive and act within real environments with human-like capabilities. However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions. By integrating window-based Bundle Adjustment with global optimization, our method converts long real-world video sequences into a comprehensive 4D multimodal format. DynamicVerse delivers a large-scale dataset consists of 100K+ videos with 800K+ annotated masks and 10M+ frames from internet videos. Experimental evaluations on three benchmark tasks, namely video depth estimation, camera pose estimation, and camera intrinsics estimation, demonstrate that our 4D modeling achieves superior performance in capturing physical-scale measurements with greater global accuracy than existing methods.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了单次通过的无姿态算法，在性能和速度上达到最先进水平，为自动驾驶训练和评估提供了实用的4D重建方案。

Abstract: Autonomous driving needs fast, scalable 4D reconstruction and re-simulation for training and evaluation, yet most methods for dynamic driving scenes still rely on per-scene optimization, known camera calibration, or short frame windows, making them slow and impractical. We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed. Trained and evaluated on large-scale driving benchmarks (Waymo, nuScenes, Argoverse2), our method outperforms prior work both when trained on each dataset and in zero-shot transfer across datasets, and it scales well as the number of input frames increases.

Motivation: 肖像视频编辑需要灵活而精确的控制各种修改（如外观变化、表情编辑等），关键难点在于保持主体原始时间行为，要求每个编辑帧与对应源帧精确同步。

Method: 使用图像到视频扩散模型，通过修改第一帧定义编辑内容并传播到整个序列。训练基于同步过滤的上下文LoRA，使用描绘相同运动轨迹但外观不同的配对视频进行训练。

Result: 在紧凑、高度精选的同步人像数据集上训练后，Sync-LoRA能够泛化到未见过的身份和多样化编辑，稳健处理姿态和表情变化，实现高视觉保真度和强时间一致性。

Conclusion: 该方法在编辑保真度和精确运动保持之间实现了稳健平衡，展示了高质量的视频编辑效果。

Abstract: Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不牺牲预测质量的前提下，有效提升视频处理的时间稳定性和对各种图像干扰的鲁棒性。

Abstract: When applied sequentially to video, frame-based networks often exhibit temporal inconsistency - for example, outputs that flicker between frames. This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss. By analyzing the theoretical properties of this loss, we identify the conditions where it produces well-behaved stabilizer training. Our experiments validate our approach on several vision tasks including denoising (NAFNet), image enhancement (HDRNet), monocular depth (Depth Anything v2), and semantic segmentation (DeepLabv3+). Our method improves temporal stability and robustness against a range of image corruptions (including compression artifacts, noise, and adverse weather), while preserving or improving the quality of predictions.

Conclusion: AutoBrep通过统一的标记化方案结合Transformer模型，成功实现了高质量B-Rep生成，为可控CAD生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-Rep) is the standard data structure used in Computer-Aided Design (CAD) for defining solid models. Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Motivation: MRI采集时间长限制临床使用，现有展开网络存在中间步骤参数自由学习导致的不稳定问题，而扩散模型虽然理论稳定但计算成本高。

Method: 通过理论证明展开网络是条件概率流ODE的离散实现，提出FLAT方法从ODE离散化推导展开参数，并将中间重建与理想ODE轨迹对齐。

Result: 在三个MRI数据集上的实验表明，FLAT相比扩散生成模型减少3倍迭代次数，相比展开网络显著提高稳定性。

Conclusion: FLAT方法通过ODE理论连接有效提升了MRI重建的稳定性和效率，为医学图像重建提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers excellent soft-tissue contrast without ionizing radiation, but its long acquisition time limits clinical utility. Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence. Experiments on three MRI datasets show that FLAT achieves high-quality reconstructions with up to $3\times$ fewer iterations than diffusion-based generative models and significantly greater stability than unrolled networks.

Abstract: We propose MAViD, a novel Multimodal framework for Audio-Visual Dialogue understanding and generation. Existing approaches primarily focus on non-interactive systems and are limited to producing constrained and unnatural human speech.The primary challenge of this task lies in effectively integrating understanding and generation capabilities, as well as achieving seamless multimodal audio-video fusion. To solve these problems, we propose a Conductor-Creator architecture that divides the dialogue system into two primary components.The Conductor is tasked with understanding, reasoning, and generating instructions by breaking them down into motion and speech components, thereby enabling fine-grained control over interactions. The Creator then delivers interactive responses based on these instructions.Furthermore, to address the difficulty of generating long videos with consistent identity, timbre, and tone using dual DiT structures, the Creator adopts a structure that combines autoregressive (AR) and diffusion models. The AR model is responsible for audio generation, while the diffusion model ensures high-quality video generation.Additionally, we propose a novel fusion module to enhance connections between contextually consecutive clips and modalities, enabling synchronized long-duration audio-visual content generation.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework can generate vivid and contextually coherent long-duration dialogue interactions and accurately interpret users' multimodal queries.

Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法主要专注于单声道输出，缺乏空间沉浸感，而现有的双耳方法采用两阶段管道（先生成单声道音频再进行空间化），容易导致误差累积和时空不一致。

Method: 提出了ViSAudio框架，采用条件流匹配和双分支音频生成架构，两个专用分支分别建模音频潜在流，结合条件时空模块平衡声道间一致性同时保留独特空间特征。

Result: 综合实验表明ViSAudio在客观指标和主观评估上都优于现有最先进方法，能生成高质量的双耳音频，有效适应视角变化、声源运动和不同声学环境。

Conclusion: 该研究成功实现了从视频直接生成双耳空间音频的端到端方法，显著提升了音频生成的空间沉浸感和时空对齐精度。

Abstract: Despite progress in video-to-audio generation, the field focuses predominantly on mono output, lacking spatial immersion. Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

TL;DR: Video4Spatial是一个仅使用视觉数据的视频生成框架，展示了视频扩散模型能够执行复杂空间任务，包括场景导航和物体定位，无需深度或姿态等辅助模态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视频生成模型是否能够仅通过视觉数据展现出类似人类认知的视觉空间智能。

Method: 提出了Video4Spatial框架，通过视频扩散模型仅基于视频场景上下文执行空间任务，包括场景导航（遵循相机姿态指令并保持3D几何一致性）和物体定位（需要语义定位、指令遵循和规划）。

Result: Video4Spatial展示了强大的空间理解能力：能够端到端规划导航和定位目标物体，遵循相机姿态指令同时保持空间一致性，并能泛化到长上下文和域外环境。

Conclusion: 这些结果推动了视频生成模型向通用视觉空间推理的发展。

Abstract: We investigate whether video generative models can exhibit visuospatial intelligence, a capability central to human cognition, using only visual data. To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments. Taken together, these results advance video generative models toward general visuospatial reasoning.

Motivation: 当前视频生成技术擅长单镜头剪辑，但在生成需要灵活镜头安排、连贯叙事和超越文本提示的可控性的叙事性多镜头视频方面存在困难。

Method: 扩展预训练单镜头模型，集成两种新型RoPE变体：多镜头叙事RoPE（在镜头转换时应用显式相位偏移）和时空位置感知RoPE（结合参考标记和接地信号）。建立了自动化数据标注流程来提取多镜头视频数据。

Conclusion: 大量实验证明了该框架的优越性能和出色的可控性，能够有效解决多镜头视频生成的挑战。

Abstract: Current video generation techniques excel at single-shot clips but struggle to produce narrative multi-shot videos, which require flexible shot arrangement, coherent narrative, and controllability beyond text prompts. To tackle these challenges, we propose MultiShotMaster, a framework for highly controllable multi-shot video generation. We extend a pretrained single-shot model by integrating two novel variants of RoPE. First, we introduce Multi-Shot Narrative RoPE, which applies explicit phase shift at shot transitions, enabling flexible shot arrangement while preserving the temporal narrative order. Second, we design Spatiotemporal Position-Aware RoPE to incorporate reference tokens and grounding signals, enabling spatiotemporal-grounded reference injection. In addition, to overcome data scarcity, we establish an automated data annotation pipeline to extract multi-shot videos, captions, cross-shot grounding signals and reference images. Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene. Both shot count and duration are flexibly configurable. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and outstanding controllability of our framework.

TL;DR: PPTArena是一个用于PowerPoint编辑的基准测试，专注于基于自然语言指令对真实幻灯片进行可靠修改。PPTPilot是该基准上的一个结构感知幻灯片编辑代理，在复杂编辑任务中表现优于现有系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PowerPoint编辑工具主要关注图像-PDF渲染或文本到幻灯片生成，缺乏对真实幻灯片进行可靠原位编辑的评估基准。PPTArena旨在填补这一空白，衡量在自然语言指令下对真实幻灯片的修改能力。

Method: PPTArena包含100个演示文稿、2125张幻灯片和800多个目标编辑任务。PPTPilot代理采用结构感知方法，通过语义编辑序列规划、高级编程工具与确定性XML操作之间的路由，以及迭代的计划-编辑-检查循环来确保精确控制。

Result: PPTPilot在复合编辑、布局敏感编辑和跨幻灯片编辑方面比现有专有代理和前沿VLM系统高出10个百分点以上，在视觉保真度和整体一致性方面表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 尽管PPTPilot取得了显著改进，但现有代理在PPTArena的长时程、文档级任务上仍然表现不佳，这凸显了可靠PowerPoint编辑领域仍面临的挑战。

Abstract: We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.

Conclusion: OneThinker标志着向统一多模态推理通用模型迈出了一步，所有代码、模型和数据均已发布。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently achieved remarkable success in eliciting visual reasoning within Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist. All code, model, and data are released.

TL;DR: CAMEO是一种基于几何对应关系监督注意力图的训练技术，能显著提升多视角扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，将收敛所需训练迭代次数减半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于注意力的多视角扩散模型虽然能实现视角一致性生成，但其几何对应信号在较大视角变化下不完整且精度下降，需要更有效的训练机制来增强几何对应学习。

Method: 通过直接使用几何对应关系监督注意力图，特别是仅监督单个注意力层，引导模型学习精确的几何对应，从而保持参考图像的几何结构和加速收敛。

Result: CAMEO将收敛所需训练迭代次数减少50%，在相同迭代次数下实现更优的性能，且该方法具有模型无关性，可应用于任何多视角扩散模型。

Conclusion: CAMEO通过简单而有效的注意力监督机制，显著提升了多视角扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量，验证了直接几何监督对学习精确对应关系的有效性。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for novel view synthesis, yet the underlying mechanism that enables their view-consistency remains unclear. In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts. We further demonstrate that CAMEO is model-agnostic and can be applied to any multi-view diffusion model.

Motivation: 扩散变换器虽然擅长整体生成，但使用单一提示无法区分用户对内容、位置和外观的不同意图，存在用户意图差距问题

Method: 采用分层组合方法：内容层控制创建内容，空间层控制位置，结构层控制形状，颜色层控制调色板；包含专门的数据生成管道、统一控制模块和微调的空间分支

Result: 大量实验验证该分层方法有效解决了用户意图差距问题，为创作者提供了直接、直观的生成过程控制

Conclusion: 分层组合范式成功弥合了扩散模型的语义能力与传统图形软件的细粒度控制之间的差距

Abstract: We propose MagicQuill V2, a novel system that introduces a \textbf{layered composition} paradigm to generative image editing, bridging the gap between the semantic power of diffusion models and the granular control of traditional graphics software. While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.

Motivation: 传统的手工编码方法在非结构化环境中的复杂操作任务中效果不佳，而强化学习虽然能提供更通用的策略，但其稳定性和可靠性难以保证，存在安全隐患，且从仿真到真实世界的迁移会带来不可预测的情况。

Method: 将力和触觉感知引入强化学习，利用力触觉在机器人动态控制和人机交互中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 基于力的强化学习方法对环境更具适应性，尤其在仿真到真实世界的迁移中表现良好，在多种机器人应用中具有广阔前景。

Abstract: For the task with complicated manipulation in unstructured environments, traditional hand-coded methods are ineffective, while reinforcement learning can provide more general and useful policy. Although the reinforcement learning is able to obtain impressive results, its stability and reliability is hard to guarantee, which would cause the potential safety threats. Besides, the transfer from simulation to real world also will lead in unpredictable situations. To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning. Force and tactual sensation play key roles in robotic dynamic control and human-robot interaction. We demonstrate that the force-based reinforcement learning method can be more adaptive to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer. Experimental results show in object pushing task, our strategy is safer and more efficient in both simulation and real world, thus it holds prospects for a wide variety of robotic applications.

Motivation: 在野火等紧急响应中，需要快速高效的通信网络。使用无人机群形成自组织网络可以连接应急人员，但极端环境可能导致单个网络节点失效，从而中断通信。

Method: 提出了鲁棒任务网络抗损耗问题（RTNUA），并开发了ΦIREMAN算法，该算法利用物理启发的势场来主动管理冗余和恢复损耗。

Result: 在25种问题配置的模拟中，ΦIREMAN始终优于DCCRS基准，在包含100个任务和500架无人机的规模化问题中，尽管存在显著损耗，仍能保持>99.9%的任务正常运行时间。

Conclusion: 该方法在极端环境下具有有效性和可扩展性，能够为紧急响应提供可靠的通信网络支持。

Abstract: Fast, efficient, robust communication during wildfire and other emergency responses is critical. One way to achieve this is by coordinating swarms of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying communications equipment to form an ad-hoc network connecting emergency response personnel to both each other and central command. However, operating in such extreme environments may lead to individual networking agents being damaged or rendered inoperable, which could bring down the network and interrupt communications.
  To overcome this challenge and enable multi-agent UAV networking in difficult environments, this paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks ($Φ$IREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, $Φ$IREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains $>99.9\%$ task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.

Our method tightly couples visual and inertial cues within a unified optimization framework, jointly refining camera poses, depths, and IMU states. It features robust IMU initialization, time-varying bias modeling, and loop closure with consistent Gaussian updates.

Conclusion: 解耦建模方法能有效提升世界模型在不同车辆参数下的泛化能力，结合策略调整和增强策略可进一步提高系统鲁棒性。

Abstract: World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.

Motivation: 大规模或时间敏感场景中的信息收集需要多智能体系统在有限时间预算内实现广泛覆盖。现有基于自回归意图预测的方法存在计算成本高和误差累积问题

Conclusion: AID证明了扩散模型在MAIPP问题中的有效性，提供了一种计算高效且可扩展的分布式协调解决方案

Abstract: Information gathering in large-scale or time-critical scenarios (e.g., environmental monitoring, search and rescue) requires broad coverage within limited time budgets, motivating the use of multi-agent systems. These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as "intent" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/marmotlab/AID.

Abstract: As robots become more adaptable, responsive, and capable of interacting with humans, the design of effective human-robot collaboration becomes critical. Yet, this design process is typically led by monodisciplinary approaches, often overlooking interdisciplinary knowledge and the experiential knowledge of workers who will ultimately share tasks with these systems. To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects. The framework emerges as an intermediate-level knowledge artifact and a boundary object that bridges technical and experiential domains, guiding designers, empowering workers, and contributing to more just and collaborative futures of work.

Motivation: 解决机器人抓取模仿学习中的多模态问题：当场景包含多个有效目标时，不同对象的抓取演示会产生冲突的训练信号，导致标准模仿学习策略平均化不同动作而产生无效动作。

Method: 使用冻结的SAM2模型提取视觉时序特征，引入轻量级可训练动作头与原生分割头并行工作。通过初始提示（如边界框）指定特定抓取对象，利用SAM2的时序跟踪能力持续预测单一明确的抓取轨迹。

Conclusion: SAM2Grasp通过时序提示方法成功解决了多目标抓取中的多模态问题，证明了其在复杂场景下的有效性和优越性。

Abstract: Imitation learning for robotic grasping is often plagued by the multimodal problem: when a scene contains multiple valid targets, demonstrations of grasping different objects create conflicting training signals. Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.

Abstract: We introduce Robowheel, a data engine that converts human hand object interaction (HOI) videos into training-ready supervision for cross morphology robotic learning. From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments. We further assemble a large scale multimodal dataset combining multi-camera captures, monocular videos, and public HOI corpora for training and evaluating embodied models.

Abstract: Safe autonomous driving in mixed traffic requires a unified understanding of multimodal interactions and dynamic planning under uncertainty. Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have recently achieved remarkable progress in robotic manipulation, yet they remain limited in failure diagnosis and learning from failures. Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Abstract: Multi-robot task allocation in construction automation has traditionally relied on optimization methods such as Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning. This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.

Conclusion: TACO方法通过测试时间缩放有效解决了VLA模型推理不稳定性问题，具有计算效率高、无需梯度更新的优势，与离线RL中的反探索原理相似。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.

Abstract: The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Visual traversability estimation is critical for autonomous navigation, but existing VLM-based methods rely on hand-crafted prompts, generalize poorly across embodiments, and output only traversability maps, leaving trajectory generation to slow external planners. We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples. It generalizes reliably to unseen environments in simulation and real-world trials, offering a scalable, prompt-free approach to unified traversability reasoning and trajectory generation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了两种轻量级视觉适应方法（FTM和FLA），通过微调视觉表征来显著提升VLA模型在新视角下的鲁棒性，仅需极少参数即可将Libero数据集上的准确率从48.5%提升至90.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言-动作模型在分布内表现良好，但在新相机视角和视觉扰动下性能急剧下降，这种脆弱性主要源于空间建模而非物理建模的错位。

Method: 提出一次性适应框架：1) FTM方法对视觉token应用全局仿射变换（仅需4K参数）；2) FLA方法对ViT编码器引入低秩更新（4.7M参数），实现与LoRA相当的效果但成本更低。

Result: FTM将Libero视角准确率从48.5%提升至87.1%；FLA进一步提升至90.8%，接近全参数微调效果但参数量大幅减少。

Conclusion: 预训练VLA模型具有大量未被挖掘的鲁棒性潜力，通过有针对性的最小视觉适应即可有效恢复视角泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong in-distribution performance but degrade sharply under novel camera viewpoints and visual perturbations. We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.

Abstract: Task-space control of robotic fingers is a critical enabler of dexterous manipulation, as manipulation objectives are most naturally specified in terms of fingertip motions and applied forces rather than individual joint angles. While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.

Abstract: Robust perception and dynamics modeling are fundamental to real-world robotic policy learning. Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.

Abstract: Diabetes is a serious worldwide health issue, and successful intervention depends on early detection. However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance.

Abstract: Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.

Abstract: The boundary element method (BEM) provides an efficient numerical framework for solving multiple scattering problems in unbounded homogeneous domains, since it reduces the discretization to the domain boundaries, thereby condensing the computational complexity. The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems.

*M. A. Gameiro*

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种名为SFL Transformer的新型深度学习模型，通过将辅助结构特征直接集成到预训练Transformer的自注意力机制中，实现了歌词内容分类的特征融合架构创新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在验证在Transformer编码器堆栈中间注入辅助上下文是结合结构和语义信息的最有效方法，以创建具有卓越判别能力和高保真概率估计的模型。

Result: SFL Transformer在UMAP降维的歌词嵌入二分类任务中实现了0.9910的准确率和0.9910的宏F1分数，显著优于之前发布的SFL模型（准确率0.9894）。模型还表现出卓越的可靠性，预期校准误差为0.0081，对数损失为0.0489。

Conclusion: 该研究验证了在Transformer中间层注入辅助结构特征能够有效协同结合结构和语义信息，产生具有优越判别能力和高保真概率估计的模型。

Abstract: This study introduces a significant architectural advancement in feature fusion for lyrical content classification by integrating auxiliary structural features directly into the self-attention mechanism of a pre-trained Transformer. I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.

Motivation: 解决工业AI应用面临的两个关键瓶颈：高质量数据稀缺和黑盒模型缺乏可解释性，特别是在航空航天等安全敏感领域。

Method: 采用三阶段物理数据增强协议（差异化噪声注入、硬物理约束、参数关系保持）和嵌套优化策略（符号回归探索方程结构，差分进化优化参数，混合全局-局部优化精细调参）。

Conclusion: 该框架为开发可信赖的AI系统提供了通用蓝图，将工程领域知识直接嵌入架构中，在数据有限但物理理解可用的高风险工业应用中实现可靠采用。

Abstract: The industrial adoption of Artificial Intelligence for Engineering (AI4E) faces two fundamental bottlenecks: scarce high-quality data and the lack of interpretability in black-box models-particularly critical in safety-sensitive sectors like aerospace. We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency. This equation not only provides quantitative predictions but also delivers explicit physical insight, revealing how thermal, geometric, and metallurgical mechanisms couple to drive cracking-thereby advancing engineers' cognitive understanding of the process. Furthermore, the constitutive equation serves as a multi-functional tool for process optimization and high-fidelity virtual data generation, enabling accuracy improvements in other data-driven models. Our approach provides a general blueprint for developing trustworthy AI systems that embed engineering domain knowledge directly into their architecture, enabling reliable adoption in high-stakes industrial applications where data is limited but physical understanding is available.

TL;DR: 提出Ada-MoGE自适应高斯专家混合模型，通过频谱强度和频率响应动态调整专家数量，解决传统MoE模型在频率分布变化时专家数量固定的问题，在6个公开基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列预测中，数据频谱分布会随时间演变，传统MoE模型使用固定专家数量难以适应这种变化，导致频率覆盖不平衡问题——专家过少会忽略关键信息，过多会引入噪声。

Method: Ada-MoGE模型集成频谱强度和频率响应来自适应确定专家数量，使用高斯带通滤波器平滑分解频域特征以避免直接频带截断引入噪声。

Result: 在6个公开基准测试中，仅使用20万参数就达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应专家数量确定机制和频域特征优化方法有效解决了频率覆盖不平衡问题，显著提升了多元时间序列预测性能。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasts are widely used, such as industrial, transportation and financial forecasts. However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation. The experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on six public benchmarks with only 0.2 million parameters.

Result: 在八个公开基准测试上的实验表明，该方法相比现有最优基线实现了持续改进。

Conclusion: DPWMixer在计算效率和预测精度方面均优于现有方法，为解决长期时间序列预测问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a critical task in computational intelligence. While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis. Extensive experiments on eight public benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a consistent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: HTG-GCL框架能够有效解决现有GCL方法在拓扑结构识别和粒度适应性方面的局限性，为图表示学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph contrastive learning (GCL) aims to learn discriminative semantic invariance by contrasting different views of the same graph that share critical topological patterns. However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.

Conclusion: 该方法通过多约束学习框架确保特征提取过程始终围绕提升下游回归任务性能，有效解决了多模态联邦学习中的关键挑战。

Abstract: This study focuses on the feature extraction problem in multi-modal data regression. To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.

Abstract: Graph classification has gained significant attention due to its applications in chemistry, social networks, and bioinformatics. While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) effectively capture local structural patterns, they often overlook global topological features that are critical for robust representation learning. In this work, we propose GraphTCL, a dual-view contrastive learning framework that integrates structural embeddings from GNNs with topological embeddings derived from persistent homology. By aligning these complementary views through a cross-view contrastive loss, our method enhances representation quality and improves classification performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, including TU and OGB molecular graphs, demonstrate that GraphTCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This study highlights the importance of topology-aware contrastive learning for advancing graph representation methods.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了四种定价算法在三种经典双寡头模型和不同需求冲击下的竞争行为，发现强化学习算法在稳定需求下维持超竞争价格，且不同市场结构对需求冲击的反应差异显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主定价算法在数字市场中日益影响竞争，但其在现实需求条件下的行为尚未得到充分研究，需要系统分析算法、市场结构和需求不确定性如何共同影响竞争结果。

Method: 使用四种定价算法（Q-Learning、PSO、Double DQN、DDPG）在三种双寡头模型（Logit、Hotelling、Linear）下进行测试，通过自回归过程模拟不同需求冲击，并采用利润和价格基的合谋指数评估竞争行为。

Result: 强化学习算法在稳定需求下维持超竞争价格，DDPG表现出最强的合谋倾向；需求冲击对Logit市场造成显著性能下降，Hotelling市场保持稳定，Linear市场出现冲击引发的利润膨胀；算法相对排名在不同环境中保持一致。

Conclusion: 市场结构和需求不确定性对算法竞争具有关键影响，研究结果为自主定价行为的政策讨论提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Autonomous pricing algorithms are increasingly influencing competition in digital markets; however, their behavior under realistic demand conditions remains largely unexamined. This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督预训练方法未充分利用临床元数据中的领域知识，无法有效结合临床意义来改进心电图诊断性能。

Method: 开发了临床引导的对比学习方法，使用已建立的临床风险评分自适应加权负对，并处理缺失的元数据。在MIMIC-IV数据集的161K患者12导联ECG上预训练了三种规模的单导联ECG基础模型（CLEF）。

Result: 在7个保留数据集上的18个临床分类和回归任务中，CLEF在12导联ECG数据预训练后，在单导联测试中优于自监督基础模型基线：中等规模CLEF在分类任务中平均AUROC提升至少2.6%，在回归任务中平均MAE降低至少3.2%。

Conclusion: CLEF实现了更准确和可扩展的单导联ECG分析，推进了远程健康监测，其性能与监督学习方法相当，同时不需要逐样本ECG标注。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool in cardiovascular health. Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring. Code and pretrained CLEF models are available at: github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/ecg-foundation-model.

Method: 提出有序稀疏自编码器(OSAE)，扩展Matryoshka SAE方法：(1)建立严格的潜在特征排序；(2)确定性使用每个特征维度，避免先前嵌套SAE方法的基于采样的近似。

Result: 理论上证明OSAE在稀疏字典学习设置中解决了排列不可识别性问题；在Gemma2-2B和Pythia-70M模型上的实验表明，相比Matryoshka基线，OSAE有助于提高一致性。

Conclusion: OSAE通过引入特征排序和确定性特征使用机制，有效提升了稀疏自编码器特征学习的稳定性和一致性，为神经网络可解释性提供了更可靠的工具。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have been widely used for interpretability of neural networks, but their learned features often vary across seeds and hyperparameter settings. We introduce Ordered Sparse Autoencoders (OSAE), which extend Matryoshka SAEs by (1) establishing a strict ordering of latent features and (2) deterministically using every feature dimension, avoiding the sampling-based approximations of prior nested SAE methods. Theoretically, we show that OSAEs resolve permutation non-identifiability in settings of sparse dictionary learning where solutions are unique (up to natural symmetries). Empirically on Gemma2-2B and Pythia-70M, we show that OSAEs can help improve consistency compared to Matryoshka baselines.

Abstract: The 'Doughnut' of social and planetary boundaries has emerged as a popular framework for assessing environmental and social sustainability. Here, we provide a proof-of-concept analysis that shows how machine learning (ML) methods can be applied to a simple macroeconomic model of the Doughnut. First, we show how ML methods can be used to find policy parameters that are consistent with 'living within the Doughnut'. Second, we show how a reinforcement learning agent can identify the optimal trajectory towards desired policies in the parameter space. The approaches we test, which include a Random Forest Classifier and $Q$-learning, are frugal ML methods that are able to find policy parameter combinations that achieve both environmental and social sustainability. The next step is the application of these methods to a more complex ecological macroeconomic model.

Abstract: Sperm whales communicate in short sequences of clicks known as codas. We present WhAM (Whale Acoustics Model), the first transformer-based model capable of generating synthetic sperm whale codas from any audio prompt. WhAM is built by finetuning VampNet, a masked acoustic token model pretrained on musical audio, using 10k coda recordings collected over the past two decades. Through iterative masked token prediction, WhAM generates high-fidelity synthetic codas that preserve key acoustic features of the source recordings. We evaluate WhAM's synthetic codas using Fréchet Audio Distance and through perceptual studies with expert marine biologists. On downstream classification tasks including rhythm, social unit, and vowel classification, WhAM's learned representations achieve strong performance, despite being trained for generation rather than classification.

Conclusion: InstructLR框架能够有效解决低资源语言高质量指令数据集生成的问题，为支持非洲大陆等地区的低资源语言提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Effective text generation and chat interfaces for low-resource languages (LRLs) remain a challenge for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) to support. This is mainly due to the difficulty of curating high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs, a limitation prevalent in the languages spoken across the African continent and other regions. Current approaches, such as automated translation and synthetic data generation, frequently yield outputs that lack fluency or even orthographic consistency. In this paper, we introduce InstructLR, a novel framework designed to generate high-quality instruction datasets for LRLs. Our approach integrates LLM-driven text generation with a dual-layer quality filtering mechanism: an automated filtering layer based on retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG)-based n-shot prompting, and a human-in-the-loop validation layer. Drawing inspiration from benchmarks such as MMLU in task definition, InstructLR has facilitated the creation of three multi-domain instruction benchmarks: ZarmaInstruct-50k, BambaraInstruct-50k, and FulfuldeInstruct-50k.

Our goal is to establish the improved efficiency and performance gains achieved by integrating online model selection methods into reinforcement learning training procedures. We examine the theoretical characterizations that are effective for identifying the right configuration in practice, and address three practical criteria from a theoretical perspective: 1) Efficient resource allocation, 2) Adaptation under non-stationary dynamics, and 3) Training stability across different seeds. Our theoretical results are accompanied by empirical evidence from various model selection tasks in reinforcement learning, including neural architecture selection, step-size selection, and self model selection.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly influence safety-critical aspects of society, from medical diagnosis to autonomous mobility, making uncertainty awareness a central requirement for trustworthy AI. We present a photonic Bayesian machine that leverages the inherent randomness of chaotic light sources to enable uncertainty reasoning within the framework of Bayesian Neural Networks. The analog processor features a 1.28 Tbit/s digital interface compatible with PyTorch, enabling probabilistic convolutions processing within 37.5 ps per convolution. We use the system for simultaneous classification and out-of-domain detection of blood cell microscope images and demonstrate reasoning between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. The photonic Bayesian machine removes the bottleneck of pseudo random number generation in digital systems, minimizes the cost of sampling for probabilistic models, and thus enables high-speed trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于最小神经网络架构的方法，用于学习系统发育距离函数，替代传统的基于复杂模型的距离计算方法，具有计算效率高、可扩展性强的特点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的系统发育关系推断方法依赖于复杂的分子进化模型，计算成本高昂且难以扩展到大规模分类群。需要开发更高效、可扩展的距离函数学习方法。

Method: 设计最小神经网络架构来近似经典系统发育距离函数，学习不同分子进化模型下的距离特性，相比基于模型的方法和卷积/transformer网络具有更小的计算足迹。

Result: 学习到的距离函数具有良好的泛化能力，在适当的训练数据集上能够达到与最先进推断方法相当的结果，且能扩展到大量分类群和分子特征。

Conclusion: 神经网络方法为系统发育分析提供了高效、可扩展的替代方案，在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，适用于大规模生物信息学分析。

Abstract: Inferring the phylogenetic relationships among a sample of organisms is a fundamental problem in modern biology. While distance-based hierarchical clustering algorithms achieved early success on this task, these have been supplanted by Bayesian and maximum likelihood search procedures based on complex models of molecular evolution. In this work we describe minimal neural network architectures that can approximate classic phylogenetic distance functions and the properties required to learn distances under a variety of molecular evolutionary models. In contrast to model-based inference (and recently proposed model-free convolutional and transformer networks), these architectures have a small computational footprint and are scalable to large numbers of taxa and molecular characters. The learned distance functions generalize well and, given an appropriate training dataset, achieve results comparable to state-of-the art inference methods.

Result: 研究发现，通过公平性约束提高模型公平性会显著改变特征重要性排名，且在不同种族亚组间的变化方式存在差异。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了在模型评估中需要同时考虑准确性、公平性和可解释性，而不是孤立地评估这些指标。

Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning in healthcare requires strong predictive performance, fairness, and explanations. While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk. We also evaluate multiple model classes on the stability of Shapley-based rankings. We find that increasing model fairness across racial subgroups can significantly alter feature importance rankings, sometimes in different ways across groups. These results highlight the need to jointly consider accuracy, fairness, and explainability in model assessment rather than in isolation.

Result: 证明了相对于概念类和分布族，任何m样本的带查询可测试学习算法都不能比最佳m样本PAC学习器在时间效率上具有超多项式优势。

Conclusion: 在可测试学习框架下，成员查询无法提供超多项式的时间复杂度改进，且某些高效的成员查询学习器无法被转化为可测试的算法。

Abstract: Membership queries (MQ) often yield speedups for learning tasks, particularly in the distribution-specific setting. We show that in the \emph{testable learning} model of Rubinfeld and Vasilyan [RV23], membership queries cannot decrease the time complexity of testable learning algorithms beyond the complexity of sample-only distribution-specific learning. In the testable learning model, the learner must output a hypothesis whenever the data distribution satisfies a desired property, and if it outputs a hypothesis, the hypothesis must be near-optimal.
  We give a general reduction from sample-based \emph{refutation} of boolean concept classes, as presented in [Vadhan17, KL18], to testable learning with queries (TL-Q). This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18]. The result is that, relative to a concept class and a distribution family, no $m$-sample TL-Q algorithm can be super-polynomially more time-efficient than the best $m$-sample PAC learner.
  Finally, we define a class of ``statistical'' MQ algorithms that encompasses many known distribution-specific MQ learners, such as those based on influence estimation or subcube-conditional statistical queries. We show that TL-Q algorithms in this class imply efficient statistical-query refutation and learning algorithms. Thus, combined with known SQ dimension lower bounds, our results imply that these efficient membership query learners cannot be made testable.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个衡量等变误差的原则性方法，发现在3D旋转等变任务中，模型能够在1k-10k训练步内快速将等变误差降低到≤2%的验证损失。学习3D旋转等变性比主要预测任务更容易，具有更平滑的损失景观。非等变模型在整个训练过程中损失惩罚较小，可能在计算效率上优于等变模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究数据增强训练的对称性无关模型学习尊重对称性的速度和效果，探究等变误差与学习梯度、模型参数之间的关系。

Method: 推导出等变误差的度量方法（对于凸损失计算学习对称性不完美导致的损失比例），在分子任务（流匹配、力场预测、体素去噪）上实证研究3D旋转等变性。

Result: 模型能快速学习3D旋转等变性（1k-10k步内等变误差≤2%），等变性学习任务比主要预测任务更容易且损失景观更好。非等变模型可能获得更低测试损失（按GPU小时计算），除非缩小等变模型的效率差距。

Conclusion: 3D旋转等变性相对容易学习，但等变模型需要在计算效率上改进才能与非等变模型竞争。等变误差与学习梯度和模型参数存在理论和实验上的关联。

Abstract: While data augmentation is widely used to train symmetry-agnostic models, it remains unclear how quickly and effectively they learn to respect symmetries. We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\leq$2\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed. We also experimentally and theoretically investigate the relationships between relative equivariance error, learning gradients, and model parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统玻尔兹曼机训练成本高，受限玻尔兹曼机表达力有限，需要开发既能并行采样又保持高精度的新方法。

Method: 结合量子启发的模拟分岔算法开发LSB采样器，并提出CEM方法估计逆温度参数，形成SAL学习框架。

Result: SAL框架在保持MCMC精度的同时实现并行采样，适用于一般耦合的玻尔兹曼机，突破了RBMs的表达限制。

Conclusion: SAL为基于能量的生成建模开辟了新途径，使更复杂的玻尔兹曼机模型具有实际应用可行性。

Abstract: Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.

Motivation: 检索增强模型将参数预测器与非参数记忆相结合，但在具有概念漂移的流式监督学习中的应用尚未得到充分理解。本文旨在研究非平稳环境中的在线分类问题。

Method: 提出RAM-OL方法，作为随机梯度下降的简单扩展，维护过去示例的小缓冲区。包括朴素回放变体和门控回放变体，后者使用时窗、相似度阈值和梯度重加权来约束邻居选择。

Result: 在强周期漂移的数据流上，RAM-OL将预知准确率提高了约7个百分点，并大幅减少了随机种子间的方差；在噪声航空数据流上，门控变体与纯在线基线表现相当。

Conclusion: 检索增强记忆是概念漂移下在线学习的实用且鲁棒的工具，能够有效平衡相关过去数据的快速重用与对过时机制的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented models couple parametric predictors with non-parametric memories, but their use in streaming supervised learning with concept drift is not well understood. We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline. These results show that retrieval-augmented memory is a practical and robust tool for online learning under concept drift.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究比较了多种统计和机器学习模型在预测波士顿MBTA地铁系统使用量（以闸机入口数为代理）和延误次数方面的性能，发现日期特征比天气数据对预测准确性更重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MBTA系统经常面临延误和客流波动问题，影响效率和乘客满意度，需要找到最佳预测方法来改善系统管理。

Method: 使用10种统计和机器学习模型预测地铁使用量，11种模型预测延误次数（包括自激励点过程模型），考虑日期、季节、天气等因素，通过RMSE评估模型性能。

Result: 研究发现提供日期或季节数据比天气数据对预测准确性更有益，天气数据通常会降低模型性能，表明模型容易过拟合。

Conclusion: 在预测公共交通使用和延误时，应优先考虑日期和季节特征，而非天气数据，以避免模型过拟合。

Abstract: The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着代码生成、深度推理和长文档理解等任务的需求增长，长上下文生成成为LLMs的关键能力。推测解码是加速生成的有效方法，但随着上下文长度增加，验证过程成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出SpecPV自推测解码方法：使用部分KV状态进行快速验证，并定期应用全验证来消除累积错误。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试和模型（包括LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct和Qwen3系列）上验证，SpecPV相比标准自回归解码实现了最高6倍的解码加速，且性能下降极小。

Conclusion: SpecPV有效解决了长上下文生成中推测解码的验证瓶颈问题，显著提升了生成效率。

Abstract: Growing demands from tasks like code generation, deep reasoning, and long-document understanding have made long-context generation a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs). Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors. We validate SpecPV across multiple long-context benchmarks and models, including LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct and Qwen3-series. Experimental results show that SpecPV achieves up to 6x decoding speedup over standard autoregressive decoding with minor degradation.

Conclusion: FOVA通过投票机制有效缓解混合质量数据问题，提升了离线联邦强化学习的效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Offline Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL), a marriage of federated learning and offline reinforcement learning, has attracted increasing interest recently. Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy. Extensive experiments corroborate the significant performance gains of our proposed algorithm over existing baselines on widely used benchmarks.

Conclusion: GPOMDP为POMDPs的策略优化提供了有效的梯度估计方法，具有计算效率高、无需状态信息的优势。

Abstract: This paper discusses theoretical and experimental aspects of gradient-based approaches to the direct optimization of policy performance in controlled POMDPs. We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $β\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Transformer加速器主要利用注意力机制中的行内稀疏性，而很少考虑行间稀疏性。利用行间稀疏性的方法通常依赖昂贵的全局相似性估计，且仅应用于一两个Transformer组件，限制了加速效果。

Result: 在26个基准测试上，SPLS将总计算量减少52.03%，准确率损失小于1%。ESACT实现端到端能效3.29 TOPS/W，注意力级能效比SOTA加速器SpAtten和Sanger分别提升2.95倍和2.26倍。

Conclusion: 局部相似性方法能够以较低计算开销实现端到端稀疏加速，ESACT证明了在保持模型精度的同时显著提升Transformer硬件部署效率的可行性。

Abstract: Transformers, composed of QKV generation, attention computation, and FFNs,
  have become the dominant model across various domains due to their outstanding performance.
  However, their high computational cost hinders efficient hardware deployment.
  Sparsity offers a promising solution,
  yet most existing accelerators exploit only intra-row sparsity in attention,
  while few consider inter-row sparsity.
  Approaches leveraging inter-row sparsity often rely on costly global similarity estimation,
  which diminishes the acceleration benefits of sparsity,
  and typically apply sparsity to only one or two transformer components.
  Through careful analysis of the attention distribution and computation flow,
  we observe that local similarity allows end-to-end sparse acceleration with lower computational overhead.
  Motivated by this observation, we propose ESACT,
  an end-to-end sparse accelerator for compute-intensive Transformers.
  ESACT centers on the Sparsity Prediction with Local Similarity (SPLS) mechanism,
  which leverages HLog quantization to accurately predict local attention sparsity prior to QK generation,
  achieving efficient sparsity across all transformer components.
  To support efficient hardware realization, we introduce three architectural innovations.
  Experimental results on 26 benchmarks demonstrate that
  SPLS reduces total computation by 52.03% with less than 1% accuracy loss.
  ESACT achieves an end-to-end energy efficiency of 3.29 TOPS/W,
  and improves attention-level energy efficiency by 2.95x and 2.26x over
  SOTA attention accelerators SpAtten and Sanger, respectively.

Abstract: With increased travelling needs more than ever, traffic congestion has become a major concern in most urban areas. Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne. Our experiments show that the proposed framework could reduce the average travel time loss of vehicles significantly, reaching upto 47%, with a negligible increase in the walking distance for parking.

Conclusion: 静态数据策略如剪枝和合成数据生成对模型能力的提升有限，而动态数据管理策略在理论上能更有效地加速神经网络训练。

Abstract: Large-scale neural models are increasingly trained with data pruning, synthetic data generation, cross-model distillation, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), and difficulty-based sampling. While several of these data-centric strategies reliably improve training efficiency and downstream performance, others fail to provide meaningful gains -- most notably self-generated synthetic data, which often increases dataset volume without enhancing model capability.
  We formalize data curation as reweighting the sampling distribution and map its effect onto the eigenstructure of the data-induced operator. Our first main result shows that \textbf{static pruning induces a bounded operator and therefore cannot change the spectral tail exponent}; it provides at most finite-region improvements and cannot alter asymptotic neural scaling. Our second result analyzes \textbf{time-dependent data curation}, showing that an ideal oracle capable of tracking spectral residuals and continuously re-normalizing the tail can provably accelerate learning -- although practical systems can only approximate this behavior.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Offline Reinforcement Learning aims to train an agent deployed in the target environment, leveraging both a limited target domain dataset and a source domain dataset with (possibly) sufficient data coverage. Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain. Motivated by the theoretical insights, we propose to selectively share those source domain samples with both high dynamics and value alignment and present our \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method. We design a range of dynamics shift settings, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, as well as in challenging extremely low-data settings where the target domain dataset contains only 5,000 transitions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms prior strong baselines and delivers exceptional performance across multiple tasks and datasets.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了LLM智能体在长上下文环境下的能力和安全问题，发现当上下文长度达到100K-200K tokens时，模型性能和安全拒绝率会出现显著且不可预测的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注LLM在长上下文提示下的评估，而智能体设置下的能力和安全问题相对未被探索，特别是在工具调用和多步任务场景下。

Method: 通过实验评估不同LLM智能体在长上下文窗口（1M-2M tokens）下的任务表现和安全拒绝行为，分析上下文长度、类型和位置对性能的影响。

Result: 模型在100K tokens时已出现严重性能下降，性能降幅超过50%；安全拒绝率变化不可预测，GPT-4.1-nano从5%升至40%，而Grok 4 Fast从80%降至10%。

Conclusion: 长上下文环境下的LLM智能体存在潜在安全风险，当前评估指标和范式需要重新审视，智能体的能力和安全表现与传统LLM评估存在显著差异。

Abstract: Solving complex or long-horizon problems often requires large language models (LLMs) to use external tools and operate over a significantly longer context window. New LLMs enable longer context windows and support tool calling capabilities. Prior works have focused mainly on evaluation of LLMs on long-context prompts, leaving agentic setup relatively unexplored, both from capability and safety perspectives. Our work addresses this gap. We find that LLM agents could be sensitive to length, type, and placement of the context, exhibiting unexpected and inconsistent shifts in task performance and in refusals to execute harmful requests. Models with 1M-2M token context windows show severe degradation already at 100K tokens, with performance drops exceeding 50\% for both benign and harmful tasks. Refusal rates shift unpredictably: GPT-4.1-nano increases from $\sim$5\% to $\sim$40\% while Grok 4 Fast decreases from $\sim$80\% to $\sim$10\% at 200K tokens. Our work shows potential safety issues with agents operating on longer context and opens additional questions on the current metrics and paradigm for evaluating LLM agent safety on long multi-step tasks. In particular, our results on LLM agents reveal a notable divergence in both capability and safety performance compared to prior evaluations of LLMs on similar criteria.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 面对全球城市化和极端天气事件增加的挑战，需要高分辨率城市降雨监测。传统基于物理模型的CML降雨反演方法在处理信号噪声和非线性衰减等现实复杂性方面存在困难，因此需要开发更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出TabGRU混合深度学习架构，结合Transformer和双向门控循环单元，采用可学习位置嵌入和注意力池化机制，以协同捕捉CML信号数据中的长期依赖关系和局部序列特征。

Result: 在瑞典哥德堡的公共基准数据集上验证，测试期间覆盖约10个降雨事件。TabGRU在两个站点（Torp和Barl）分别达到0.91和0.96的决定系数，优于深度学习基线，且在峰值降雨事件中有效缓解了物理模型的过估计问题。

Conclusion: TabGRU模型能够有效克服传统方法的局限性，为基于CML的城市降雨监测提供了鲁棒且准确的解决方案，在测试条件下表现出优越性能。

Abstract: In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.

Motivation: 现有跨域离线RL研究主要关注训练时的鲁棒性（处理训练数据中的动态偏移），但忽略了实际部署时测试阶段对动态扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 引入鲁棒跨域Bellman算子（RCB）增强测试时鲁棒性，同时保持对分布外动态转移的保守性；结合动态值惩罚和Huber损失技术，提出DROCO算法。

Conclusion: DROCO算法有效解决了跨域离线RL中双鲁棒性问题，在训练时和测试时都表现出优异的动态偏移鲁棒性。

Abstract: Single-domain offline reinforcement learning (RL) often suffers from limited data coverage, while cross-domain offline RL handles this issue by leveraging additional data from other domains with dynamics shifts. However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{RO}bust \textbf{C}ross-domain \textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.

Abstract: Differentiable optimization layers enable learning systems to make decisions by solving embedded optimization problems. However, computing gradients via implicit differentiation requires solving a linear system with Hessian terms, which is both compute- and memory-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel algorithm that computes the gradient using only first-order information. The key insight is to rewrite the differentiable optimization as a bilevel optimization problem and leverage recent advances in bilevel methods. Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees. We show that an approximate hypergradient can be computed using only first-order information in $\tilde{\oo}(1)$ time, leading to an overall complexity of $\tilde{\oo}(δ^{-1}ε^{-3})$ for constrained bilevel optimization, which matches the best known rate for non-smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we release an open-source Python library that can be easily adapted from existing solvers. Our code is available here: https://github.com/guaguakai/FFOLayer.

Abstract: Wireless connectivity promises to unshackle virtual reality (VR) experiences, allowing users to engage from anywhere, anytime. However, delivering seamless, high-quality, real-time VR video wirelessly is challenging due to the stringent quality of experience requirements, low latency constraints, and limited VR device capabilities. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a novel decentralized multi task fair federated learning (DMTFL) based caching that caches and prefetches each VR user's field of view (FOV) at base stations (BSs) based on the caching strategies tailored to each BS. In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS. These models are further optimized to perform well under any target distribution, while providing theoretical guarantees via Rademacher complexity and a probably approximately correct (PAC) bound on the loss. Using a realistic VR head-tracking dataset, our simulations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed DMTFL algorithm compared to baseline algorithms.

Abstract: The world currently has an abundance of ideas for how to use new LLM agents, and developers seek to rapidly prototype and test new agentic designs. However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\textbf{2.5$\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \$0.059 to \$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\textbf{2$\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy. By reducing operational costs while maintaining rapid experimentation cycles with frozen models, our approach makes advanced agentic systems economically viable for a broader range of applications.

Conclusion: FL模型有效解决了核方法中特征超参数学习问题，为大规模数据集上的核方法应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). By leveraging this CPD structure, we efficiently learn the hyperparameters associated with different features alongside the model parameters using an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) optimization method. We prove the effectiveness of the FL model through experiments on real data of various dimensionality and scale. The results show that the FL model can be consistently trained 3-5 times faster than and have the prediction quality on par with a standard cross-validated model.

Conclusion: 即使是最性能关键的、经过大量优化的内核也可以通过LLM引导的RL自动化进行改进，系统性地探索人工难以实现的配置空间。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose CUDA-L2, a system that combines large language models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically optimize Half-precision General Matrix Multiply (HGEMM) CUDA kernels. Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used {\it torch.matmul} to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt}. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0\% over {\it torch.matmul} on average; +19.2\% over {\it cuBLAS} using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8\% over {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, which queries {\it cuBLASLt} library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4\% over the most competitive {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from {\it cuBLASLt}'s suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7\%, +26.0\%, +22.4\%, and +15.9\% for {\it torch.matmul}, {\it cuBLAS}, {\it cuBLASLt-heuristic}, and {\it cuBLASLt-AutoTuning} respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

TL;DR: GoRL框架通过将优化与生成解耦，使用潜在策略进行稳定优化，同时利用条件生成解码器合成动作，解决了强化学习中策略稳定性与表达能力之间的张力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习面临一个持续存在的张力：稳定优化的策略往往过于简单，无法表示复杂控制所需的多模态动作分布。高斯策略提供可处理的似然和平滑梯度，但单模态形式限制了表达能力；而基于扩散或流匹配的生成策略可以建模丰富的多模态行为，但在在线RL中由于不可处理的似然和通过深度采样链传播的噪声梯度而不稳定。

Method: GoRL框架基于优化与生成解耦的结构原则，优化一个可处理的潜在策略，同时利用条件生成解码器合成动作。采用双时间尺度更新计划，使潜在策略能够稳定学习，而解码器稳步提高表达能力，无需可处理的动作似然。

Result: 在一系列连续控制任务中，GoRL始终优于高斯策略和最近的生成策略基线。特别是在HopperStand任务上，达到了870以上的归一化回报，是最强基线的3倍多。

Conclusion: 将优化与生成分离为既稳定又高度表达的策略提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) faces a persistent tension: policies that are stable to optimize are often too simple to represent the multimodal action distributions needed for complex control. Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline. These results demonstrate that separating optimization from generation provides a practical path to policies that are both stable and highly expressive.

Conclusion: 物理引导的Transformer架构为界面主导的热系统提供了统一的正向和逆向建模框架，在PINNs通常失效的区域保持稳定性和物理一致性。

Abstract: Heat transfer in semiconductor devices is dominated by chip and substrate assemblies, where heat generated within a finite chip layer dissipates into a semi-infinite substrate with much higher thermophysical properties. This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements. Overall, this work demonstrates that physics-guided Transformer architectures provide a unified framework for forward and inverse modeling in interface-dominated thermal systems.

Method: 使用张量核机器，通过低秩张量网络在原始域学习紧凑的非线性模型，利用正则化机制从源任务向自适应模型传递知识

Result: 在耳后EEG癫痫检测任务中，患者自适应模型在仅使用少量患者特定数据的情况下，性能优于患者无关模型和完全患者特定模型，且参数数量比自适应SVM少约100倍

Conclusion: Adapt-TKM方法在保持高性能的同时显著减少了模型参数，提高了推理速度，特别适合资源受限的可穿戴设备应用

Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SeeNav-Agent框架，通过双视角视觉提示技术减少视觉感知错误，并设计SRGPO强化微调方法提升导航规划能力，在多个基准测试中显著超越现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大视觉语言模型的视觉语言导航代理存在感知错误、推理错误和规划错误等问题，严重影响了导航性能。

Method: 1. 引入双视角视觉提示技术减少视觉模块的感知幻觉；2. 设计步级强化微调方法SRGPO，通过定义可验证过程奖励和随机分组步级优势估计来提供密集奖励信号。

Result: GPT-4.1在引入零样本VP模块后导航成功率达86.7%，超越当前最佳LVLM约20个百分点；Qwen2.5-VL-3B模型通过SRGPO后训练达到72.3%的成功率，优于现有最佳LVLM模型5.6个百分点。

Conclusion: SeeNav-Agent框架通过视觉提示和强化微调显著提升了VLN代理的性能，SRGPO在训练稳定性、收敛效率和泛化能力方面均优于现有RFT算法。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.

TL;DR: F2D2是一个同时减少基于流的生成模型中采样和似然评估所需神经函数评估次数的框架，通过联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度来解决计算瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最好的生成模型（如扩散模型和基于流的模型）需要数百到数千次神经函数评估来计算单个似然值，这限制了模型比较、微调目标和下游应用的能力。

Method: 提出快速流联合蒸馏（F2D2）框架，利用连续归一化流中采样和似然的耦合ODE共享底层速度场的特点，使用单个模型联合蒸馏采样轨迹和累积散度，仅需添加散度预测头。

Result: 实验表明F2D2能够在少量步数评估下实现准确的似然计算，同时保持高样本质量，解决了基于流生成模型的长期计算瓶颈。

Conclusion: F2D2框架成功地将采样和似然评估所需的神经函数评估次数减少两个数量级，并提出了一种轻量级自引导方法，使2步MeanFlow模型在仅增加一次反向NFE的情况下超越1024步教师模型。

Abstract: Log-likelihood evaluation enables important capabilities in generative models, including model comparison, certain fine-tuning objectives, and many downstream applications. Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应加权LS-SVM方法（AW-LSSVM），通过迭代全局耦合促进多视图间的互补学习，使每个视图能够关注其他视图在前一轮迭代中的困难样本，从而提升多视图学习性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于核的多视图学习方法大多采用融合技术而不强制视图间的显式协作类型，或使用共正则化限制了全局协作。需要一种能够促进视图间互补学习的新方法。

Method: AW-LSSVM方法通过迭代全局耦合机制，让每个视图专注于其他视图在前一轮迭代中分类错误的困难样本，实现自适应加权。该方法保持原始特征的隔离，适合隐私保护场景。

Result: 实验表明，AW-LSSVM在大多数数据集上优于现有的基于核的多视图学习方法，同时保持了特征的原始隔离性。

Conclusion: AW-LSSVM通过促进视图间的互补学习，有效提升了多视图学习性能，且由于其保持特征隔离的特性，也适用于隐私保护的应用场景。

Abstract: Multi-view learning integrates diverse representations of the same instances to improve performance. Most existing kernel-based multi-view learning methods use fusion techniques without enforcing an explicit collaboration type across views or co-regularization which limits global collaboration. We propose AW-LSSVM, an adaptive weighted LS-SVM that promotes complementary learning by an iterative global coupling to make each view focus on hard samples of others from previous iterations. Experiments demonstrate that AW-LSSVM outperforms existing kernel-based multi-view methods on most datasets, while keeping raw features isolated, making it also suitable for privacy-preserving scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于生成蒸馏的持续遗忘框架，用于解决视觉生成模型在连续删除请求场景下的稳定性危机问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉生成模型的快速发展，数据隐私法规（如GDPR的"被遗忘权"）与模型训练之间的冲突日益突出。现有的一次性遗忘方法在连续删除请求场景下会导致模型性能崩溃。

Method: 通过将每个遗忘步骤重新定义为多目标、师生蒸馏过程，借鉴持续学习原理来维持模型完整性。

Result: 在10步连续基准测试中，该方法能够更好地遗忘目标概念，同时不会显著影响保留概念的性能或整体图像质量，明显优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模生成模型的负责任部署和维护提供了可行路径，使行业能够以实用有效的方式满足持续的数据删除请求。

Abstract: The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.

Abstract: The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.

Conclusion: 熵约束共形校正方法有效解决了共形预测效率与预测熵的权衡问题，为黑盒模型提供了更优的不确定性量化方案。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) provides a comprehensive framework to produce statistically rigorous uncertainty sets for black-box machine learning models. To further improve the efficiency of CP, conformal correction is proposed to fine-tune or wrap the base model with an extra module using a conformal-aware inefficiency loss. In this work, we empirically and theoretically identify a trade-off between the CP efficiency and the entropy of model prediction. We then propose an entropy-constrained conformal correction method, exploring a better Pareto optimum between efficiency and entropy. Extensive experimental results on both computer vision and graph datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method. For instance, it can significantly improve the efficiency of state-of-the-art CP methods by up to 34.4%, given an entropy threshold.

Abstract: Graph-based Anomaly Detection models have gained widespread adoption in recent years, identifying suspicious nodes by aggregating neighborhood information. However, most existing studies overlook the pervasive issues of missing and adversarially obscured node attributes, which can undermine aggregation stability and prediction reliability. To mitigate this, we propose FGC-Comp, a lightweight, classifier-agnostic, and deployment-friendly attribute completion module-designed to enhance neighborhood aggregation under incomplete attributes. We partition each node's neighbors into three label-based groups, apply group-specific transforms to the labeled groups while a node-conditioned gate handles unknowns, fuse messages via residual connections, and train end-to-end with a binary classification objective to improve aggregation stability and prediction reliability under missing attributes. Experiments on two real-world fraud datasets validate the effectiveness of the approach with negligible computational overhead.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is essential for deploying reliable Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), where existing approaches primarily rely on Bayesian inference or ensembles. In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CGNNs deliver more reliable representations of epistemic uncertainty and achieve state-of-the-art performance under distributional shift on heterophilic graphs.

Abstract: We propose the use of adversarial wireless jamming to regularise the latent space of an autoencoder to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to determine whether a specific data point was included in the training set of a target model. Although there are have been numerous methods developed for detecting data contamination in large language models (LLMs), their performance on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) falls short due to the instabilities introduced through multimodal component adaptation and possible distribution shifts across multiple inputs. In this work, we investigate multimodal membership inference and address two issues: first, by identifying distribution shifts in the existing datasets, and second, by releasing an extended baseline pipeline to detect them. We also generalize the perturbation-based membership inference methods to MLLMs and release \textbf{FiMMIA} -- a modular \textbf{F}ramework for \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{MIA}.\footnote{The source code and framework have been made publicly available under the MIT license via \href{https://github.com/ai-forever/data_leakage_detect}{link}.The video demonstration is available on \href{https://youtu.be/a9L4-H80aSg}{YouTube}.} Our approach trains a neural network to analyze the target model's behavior on perturbed inputs, capturing distributional differences between members and non-members. Comprehensive evaluations on various fine-tuned multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of our perturbation-based membership inference attacks in multimodal domains.

Abstract: Flow-based diffusion models have emerged as a leading paradigm for training generative models across images and videos. However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices. Our study deepens the understanding of diffusion model training dynamics and offers principles for guiding future architectural and algorithmic improvements.

TL;DR: 本文研究了时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）的输入归一化方法，发现REVIN方法在零样本预测中表现最佳，相比未归一化基线减少89%的MASE误差，且无需数据集级预处理即可达到最佳域内精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据在不同领域和通道间存在显著的尺度变化和非平稳性，这会严重影响TSFMs的泛化性能，而现有的归一化方法在数据集特定模型中有研究，但在需要泛化的TSFMs中却被忽视。

Method: 通过对四种架构不同的TSFMs进行系统评估，比较了多种归一化方法，重点分析了REVIN方法的效果。

Result: REVIN被证明是最有效的归一化方法，在零样本设置下将MASE相对未归一化基线降低89%，比其他归一化方法降低44%，同时达到0.84 MASE的最佳域内精度。

Conclusion: REVIN方法提供了最高的准确率-效率权衡，但其效果利用取决于架构设计选择和优化目标，特别是训练损失尺度敏感性和模型类型（概率型、点预测型或基于LLM的模型）。

Abstract: We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).

Abstract: Recommending matches in a text-rich, dynamic two-sided marketplace presents unique challenges due to evolving content and interaction graphs. We introduce GraphMatch, a new large-scale recommendation framework that fuses pre-trained language models with graph neural networks to overcome these challenges. Unlike prior approaches centered on standalone models, GraphMatch is a comprehensive recipe built on powerful text encoders and GNNs working in tandem. It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime. These results demonstrate that unifying language and graph representations yields a highly effective solution to text-rich, dynamic two-sided recommendations, bridging the gap between powerful pretrained LMs and large-scale graphs in practice.

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应去中心化联邦学习(aDFL)方法，通过自适应调整客户端学习率来提升模型对异常客户端的鲁棒性，无需先验知识或大量正常邻居节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中异常客户端（由噪声或中毒数据引起）会显著干扰学习过程并降低模型鲁棒性。现有方法需要大量正常邻居节点或可靠客户端的先验知识，限制了实际应用。

Method: 通过自适应调整客户端学习率，对可疑客户端分配较小学习率，对正常客户端分配较大学习率，以完全自适应方式减轻异常客户端对全局模型的负面影响。

Result: 理论分析无需对邻居节点设置严格条件且无需先验知识，收敛分析保证了aDFL的oracle性质。大量数值实验表明aDFL方法具有优越性能。

Conclusion: aDFL方法有效解决了去中心化联邦学习中的异常客户端问题，提供了一种实用且鲁棒的学习框架。

Abstract: In decentralized federated learning (DFL), the presence of abnormal clients, often caused by noisy or poisoned data, can significantly disrupt the learning process and degrade the overall robustness of the model. Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the aDFL method.

Conclusion: 通过等效的单保真度测试量化了通过融合多个信息源实现的性能增益，证明了多保真度方法的附加价值。

Abstract: Outer loop tasks such as optimization, uncertainty quantification or inference can easily become intractable when the underlying high-fidelity model is computationally expensive. Similarly, data-driven architectures typically require large datasets to perform predictive tasks with sufficient accuracy. A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size. We further analyze the added value of the multi-fidelity approach by conducting equivalent single-fidelity tests for each case, quantifying the performance gains achieved through fusing multiple sources of information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定预算的多数投票来估计奖励，导致大量计算冗余。需要一种能够自适应分配推理预算的方法来提高效率。

Method: 将投票过程建模为贝叶斯序贯概率比检验，动态停止采样，并在后验置信度超过阈值时利用保留的rollout进行策略更新，与PPO或GRPO等算法无缝集成。

Result: 在多样化推理基准测试中，OptPO显著减少了rollout开销，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: OptPO通过统一统计最优停止与测试时学习，为测试时适应提供了一个计算高效的范式。

Abstract: Test-time policy optimization enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt to distribution shifts by leveraging feedback from self-generated rollouts. However, existing methods rely on fixed-budget majority voting to estimate rewards, incurring substantial computational redundancy. We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

TL;DR: Fairy2i是一个通用框架，可将预训练实数层转换为等效的广泛线性复数形式，实现极低比特量化并重用现有检查点，在2比特精度下恢复LLaMA-2 7B性能接近全精度基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然复数LLM（如iFairy）比实数模型更适合低比特表示，但需要从头训练，无法利用预训练实数基础模型。Fairy2i旨在弥合复数算术表示效率与预训练模型实用性之间的差距。

Method: 通过证明实数与广泛线性映射的无损数学等价性，将标准Transformer转换到复数域；采用相位感知量化方案和高效的四次单位根码本；引入递归残差量化机制迭代最小化量化误差。

Result: Fairy2i在有效2比特精度下将LLaMA-2 7B的性能恢复到接近全精度基线水平，显著优于最先进的实数值二值和三值量化方法。

Conclusion: 该工作为在商用硬件上实现高效推理开辟了新途径，将复数算术的表示效率与预训练模型的实用性相结合。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence, yet their massive memory and computational demands necessitate aggressive quantization, increasingly pushing representations toward the theoretical limit of a single bit. While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware.

TL;DR: 提出了一个假设检验框架，用于判断成对比较数据是否由给定的广义Thurstone模型生成，并建立了最小最大假设检验的理论基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注Thurstone模型的参数估计和不确定性量化，但缺乏对模型本身是否适用的基础假设检验方法。

Method: 引入分离距离概念，推导检验临界值的上下界，提出基于分离距离的假设检验，构建置信区间，使用反向鞅技术建立时间一致误差概率界，利用信息论方法推导最小最大下界。

Result: 对于完全观测图，检验阈值尺度为Θ((nk)^{-1/2})，其中n为代理数量，k为每对比较次数。理论结果在合成和真实数据集上得到验证。

Conclusion: 建立了一个完整的Thurstone模型假设检验框架，为成对比较数据的模型选择提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: In this work, we develop a hypothesis testing framework to determine whether pairwise comparison data is generated by an underlying \emph{generalized Thurstone model} $\mathcal{T}_F$ for a given choice function $F$. While prior work has predominantly focused on parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification for such models, we address the fundamental problem of minimax hypothesis testing for $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $Θ((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods. Finally, we validate our results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Motivation: 传统交通事故预测主要依赖道路网络结构特征，而忽略了道路表面及其周围环境的物理和环境信息。本研究旨在通过整合卫星图像等多模态数据来弥补这一不足。

Method: 构建了一个包含600万条交通事故记录和100万张高分辨率卫星图像的大型多模态数据集，使用多模态学习方法整合视觉和网络嵌入，并基于匹配估计器进行因果分析。

Conclusion: 卫星图像特征对于实现准确的交通事故预测至关重要，多模态数据整合能显著提升预测性能，并有助于识别影响事故的关键因素。

Abstract: We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\%$, which is a $3.7\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.

Conclusion: 通过数据分块技术，可以有效地将现有高斯过程近似方法应用于自相关数据，实现计算加速而不牺牲预测准确性，为解决自相关数据的快速高斯过程建模提供了实用方案。

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of how to speed up computation for Gaussian process models trained on autocorrelated data. The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.

Result: 从预训练的INR（无需访问训练数据）生成可变分辨率可视化，实现了显著的内存节省

Conclusion: PruningAMR算法能够有效利用INR的几何信息，为内存密集型可视化任务提供高效的网格生成方案

Abstract: An implicit neural representation (INR) is a neural network that approximates a spatiotemporal function. Many memory-intensive visualization tasks, including modern 4D CT scanning methods, represent data natively as INRs. While INRs are prized for being more memory-efficient than traditional data stored on a lattice, many visualization tasks still require discretization to a regular grid. We present PruningAMR, an algorithm that builds a mesh with resolution adapted to geometric features encoded by the INR. To identify these geometric features, we use an interpolative decomposition pruning method on the weight matrices of the INR. The resulting pruned network is used to guide adaptive mesh refinement, enabling automatic mesh generation tailored to the underlying resolution of the function. Starting from a pre-trained INR--without access to its training data--we produce a variable resolution visualization with substantial memory savings.

Abstract: Understanding the spatial architecture of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is critical to advance precision oncology. We present ProteinPNet, a novel framework based on prototypical part networks that discovers TME motifs from spatial proteomics data. Unlike traditional post-hoc explanability models, ProteinPNet directly learns discriminative, interpretable, faithful spatial prototypes through supervised training. We validate our approach on synthetic datasets with ground truth motifs, and further test it on a real-world lung cancer spatial proteomics dataset. ProteinPNet consistently identifies biologically meaningful prototypes aligned with different tumor subtypes. Through graphical and morphological analyses, we show that these prototypes capture interpretable features pointing to differences in immune infiltration and tissue modularity. Our results highlight the potential of prototype-based learning to reveal interpretable spatial biomarkers within the TME, with implications for mechanistic discovery in spatial omics.

Conclusion: 通过合理分配推理时计算资源并采用分布感知的聚合方法，可以将噪声较大的个体模型判断转化为可靠的评估评分。

Abstract: Thinking Large Language Models (LLMs) used as judges for pairwise preferences remain noisy at the single-sample level, and common aggregation rules (majority vote, soft self-consistency, or instruction-based self-aggregation) are inconsistent when ties are allowed. We study inference-time compute (ITC) for evaluators that generate n independent thinking-rating samples per item, and propose a principled, distribution-calibrated aggregation scheme. Our method models three-way preferences with a Bradley-Terry-Davidson formulation on rating counts, leveraging both polarity (margin among non-ties) and decisiveness (non-tie rate) to distinguish narrow margins from strong consensus. Across various evaluation benchmarks, our approach consistently reduces MAE and increases pairwise accuracy versus standard baselines, and when evaluated against human-consensus meta-labels, matches or exceeds individual human raters. These results show that carefully allocating ITC and aggregating with distribution-aware methods turns noisy individual model judgments into reliable ratings for evaluation.

Conclusion: TokenPowerBench作为开源工具发布，帮助用户测量功耗、预测运营成本并满足LLM服务部署的可持续性目标。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) services now answer billions of queries per day, and industry reports show that inference, not training, accounts for more than 90% of total power consumption. However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics. We evaluate TokenPowerBench on four of the most widely used model series (Llama, Falcon, Qwen, and Mistral). Our experiments cover from 1 billion parameters up to the frontier-scale Llama3-405B model. Furthermore, we release TokenPowerBench as open source to help users to measure power consumption, forecast operating expenses, and meet sustainability targets when deploying LLM services.
