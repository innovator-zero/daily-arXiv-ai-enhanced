Although the reinforcement learning is able to obtain impressive results, its stability and reliability is hard to guarantee, which would cause the potential safety threats.

To enhance the safety and reliability of robots, we introduce the force and haptic perception into reinforcement learning. Force and tactual sensation play key roles in robotic dynamic control and human-robot interaction. We demonstrate that the force-based reinforcement learning method can be more adaptive to environment, especially in sim-to-real transfer.

To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters.

Earth observation (EO) satellites provide critical, frequent coverage for mapping inundation, yet operational accuracy depends heavily on labeled datasets and model generalization. Recent Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), such as ESA-IBM's TerraMind, offer improved generalizability through large-scale self-supervised pretraining, but their performance on diverse global flood events remains poorly understood.\n  We fine-tune TerraMind for flood extent mapping using FloodsNet, a harmonized multimodal dataset containing co-located Sentinel-1 (Synthetic Aperture Radar, SAR data) and Sentinel-2 (optical) imagery for 85 flood events worldwide. We tested four configurations (base vs. large models; frozen vs. unfrozen backbones) and compared against the TerraMind Sen1Floods11 example and a U-Net trained on both FloodsNet and Sen1Floods11. The base-unfrozen configuration provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and recall at substantially lower computational cost than the large model.

However, overlapping risk factors and data asymmetry make prediction difficult. To use extensive health survey data to create a machine learning framework for diabetes classification that is both accurate and comprehensible, to produce results that will aid in clinical decision-making. Using the BRFSS dataset, we assessed a number of supervised learning techniques. SMOTE and Tomek Links were used to correct class imbalance. To improve prediction performance, both individual models and ensemble techniques such as stacking were investigated. The 2015 BRFSS dataset, which includes roughly 253,680 records with 22 numerical features, is used in this study. Strong ROC-AUC performance of approximately 0.96 was attained by the individual models Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.The stacking ensemble with XGBoost and KNN yielded the best overall results with 94.82\\% accuracy, ROC-AUC of 0.989, and PR-AUC of 0.991, indicating a favourable balance between recall and precision.

These scenarios are commonly formulated as multi-agent informative path planning (MAIPP), where multiple agents must coordinate to maximize information gain while operating under budget constraints. A central challenge in MAIPP is ensuring effective coordination while the belief over the environment evolves with incoming measurements. Recent learning-based approaches address this by using distributions over future positions as \"intent\" to support coordination. However, these autoregressive intent predictors are computationally expensive and prone to compounding errors. Inspired by the effectiveness of diffusion models as expressive, long-horizon policies, we propose AID, a fully decentralized MAIPP framework that leverages diffusion models to generate long-term trajectories in a non-autoregressive manner. AID first performs behavior cloning on trajectories produced by existing MAIPP planners and then fine-tunes the policy using reinforcement learning via Diffusion Policy Policy Optimization (DPPO). This two-stage pipeline enables the policy to inherit expert behavior while learning improved coordination through online reward feedback. Experiments demonstrate that AID consistently improves upon the MAIPP planners it is trained from, achieving up to 4x faster execution and 17% increased information gain, while scaling effectively to larger numbers of agents.

Published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia. Code available at: https://github.com/hdeng26/Contex", "summary": "Contrastive learning has gained popularity and pushes state-of-the-art performance across numerous large-scale benchmarks. In contrastive learning, the contrastive loss function plays a pivotal role in discerning similarities between samples through techniques such as rotation or cropping. However, this learning mechanism can also introduce information distortion from the augmented samples. This is because the trained model may develop a significant overreliance on information from samples with identical labels, while concurrently neglecting positive pairs that originate from the same initial image, especially in expansive datasets. This paper proposes a context-enriched contrastive loss function that concurrently improves learning effectiveness and addresses the information distortion by encompassing two convergence targets. The first component, which is notably sensitive to label contrast, differentiates between features of identical and distinct classes which boosts the contrastive training efficiency. Meanwhile, the second component draws closer the augmented samples from the same source image and distances all other samples. We evaluate the proposed approach on image classification tasks, which are among the most widely accepted 8 recognition large-scale benchmark datasets: CIFAR10, CIFAR100, Caltech-101, Caltech-256, ImageNet, BiasedMNIST, UTKFace, and CelebA datasets.

This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce \\emph{VoxCap}, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: \\emph{de-novo} design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse \\textit{de-novo} hits. When combined with our fast search workflow, VoxCap reduces computational time by orders of magnitude while returning hits for all query molecules, enabling the search of large libraries that are intractable to search by brute force.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VoxCap\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f53\u7d20\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u7684\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u5b50\u5e93\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u80fd\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u5316\u5408\u7269\u5e93\u4e2d\u7b5b\u9009\u5019\u9009\u5206\u5b50\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b0\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86VoxCap\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f53\u7d20\u5316\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u751f\u6210SMILES\u5b57\u7b26\u4e32\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u4ece\u5934\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u3002", "result": "VoxCap\u5728\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4ece\u5934\u547d\u4e2d\u5206\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e0e\u5feb\u901f\u641c\u7d22\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u5c06\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u964d\u4f4e\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u641c\u7d22\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e93\u3002", "conclusion": "VoxCap\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u836f\u6548\u56e2\u865a\u62df\u7b5b\u9009\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u836f\u7269\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u5177\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this gap, we introduce the robotic capabilities framework, a vocabulary that enables transdisciplinary collaborations to meaningfully shape the future of work when robotic systems are integrated into the workplace. Rather than focusing on the internal workings of robots, the framework centers discussion on high-level capabilities, supporting dialogue around which elements of a task should remain human-led and which can be delegated to robots. We developed the framework through reflexive and iterative processes, and applied it in two distinct settings: by engaging roboticists in describing existing commercial robots using its vocabulary, and through a design activity with students working on robotics-related projects.

The procedure first consists in determining the solution trace on the boundaries of the domain by solving a boundary integral equation, after which the volumetric solution can be recovered at low computational cost with a boundary integral representation. As the first step of the BEM represents the main computational bottleneck, we introduce PIBNet, a learning-based approach designed to approximate the solution trace. The method leverages a physics-inspired graph-based strategy to model obstacles and their long-range interactions efficiently. Then, we introduce a novel multiscale graph neural network architecture for simulating the multiple scattering. To train and evaluate our network, we present a benchmark consisting of several datasets of different types of multiple scattering problems. The results indicate that our approach not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art learning-based methods on the considered tasks but also exhibits superior generalization to settings with an increased number of obstacles. github.com/ENSTA-U2IS-AI/pibnet", "AI": {"tldr": "PIBNet\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u754c\u5747\u5300\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u62df\u969c\u788d\u7269\u53ca\u5176\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fb9\u754c\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u754c\u57df\u591a\u91cd\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\uff0c\u8fb9\u754c\u79ef\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u6c42\u89e3\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPIBNet\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u56fe\u57fa\u7b56\u7565\u5efa\u6a21\u969c\u788d\u7269\u53ca\u5176\u957f\u7a0b\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u91cd\u6563\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u91cd\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u969c\u788d\u7269\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PIBNet\u4e3a\u8fb9\u754c\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u91cd\u6563\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Standard imitation learning policies fail by averaging these distinct actions into a single, invalid action. In this paper, we introduce SAM2Grasp, a novel framework that resolves this issue by reformulating the task as a uni-modal, prompt-conditioned prediction problem. Our method leverages the frozen SAM2 model to use its powerful visual temporal tracking capability and introduces a lightweight, trainable action head that operates in parallel with its native segmentation head. This design allows for training only the small action head on pre-computed temporal-visual features from SAM2. During inference, an initial prompt, such as a bounding box provided by an upstream object detection model, designates the specific object to be grasped. This prompt conditions the action head to predict a unique, unambiguous grasp trajectory for that object alone. In all subsequent video frames, SAM2's built-in temporal tracking capability automatically maintains stable tracking of the selected object, enabling our model to continuously predict the grasp trajectory from the video stream without further external guidance. This temporal-prompted approach effectively eliminates ambiguity from the visuomotor policy. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that SAM2Grasp achieves state-of-the-art performance in cluttered, multi-object grasping tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SAM2Grasp\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528SAM2\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6293\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6293\u53d6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5f53\u573a\u666f\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u6f14\u793a\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6807\u51c6\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5e73\u5747\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u4f5c\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u6548\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684SAM2\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u4e0e\u539f\u751f\u5206\u5272\u5934\u5e76\u884c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u521d\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff09\u6307\u5b9a\u7279\u5b9a\u6293\u53d6\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5229\u7528SAM2\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u6301\u7eed\u9884\u6d4b\u5355\u4e00\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6742\u4e71\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6293\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u3002", "conclusion": "SAM2Grasp\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u5e8f\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u6293\u53d6\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

At subsequent stages of patient diagnosis, genetic information is extracted to help select specific patient treatment options. As the efficacy of cancer treatment often relies on early diagnosis and treatment, we build a deep latent variable model to determine patients' somatic mutation profiles based on their corresponding medical images. We first introduce a point cloud representation of lesions images to allow for invariance to the imaging modality. We then propose, LLOST, a model with dual variational autoencoders coupled together by a separate shared latent space that unifies features from the lesion point clouds and counts of distinct somatic mutations. Therefore our model consists of three latent space, each of which is learned with a conditional normalizing flow prior to account for the diverse distributions of each domain. We conduct qualitative and quantitative experiments on de-identified medical images from The Cancer Imaging Archive and the corresponding somatic mutations from the Pan Cancer dataset of The Cancer Genomic Archive. We show the model's predictive performance on the counts of specific mutations as well as it's ability to accurately predict the occurrence of mutations. In particular, shared patterns between the imaging and somatic mutation domain that reflect cancer type.

I propose the SFL Transformer, a novel deep learning model that utilizes a Contextual Gating mechanism (an Intermediate SFL) to modulate the sequence of hidden states within the BERT encoder stack, rather than fusing features at the final output layer. This approach modulates the deep, contextualized semantic features (Hseq) using low-dimensional structural cues (Fstruct). The model is applied to a challenging binary classification task derived from UMAP-reduced lyrical embeddings. The SFL Transformer achieved an Accuracy of 0.9910 and a Macro F1 score of 0.9910, significantly improving the state-of-the-art established by the previously published SFL model (Accuracy 0.9894). Crucially, this Contextual Gating strategy maintained exceptional reliability, with a low Expected Calibration Error (ECE = 0.0081) and Log Loss (0.0489). This work validates the hypothesis that injecting auxiliary context mid-stack is the most effective means of synergistically combining structural and semantic information, creating a model with both superior discriminative power and high-fidelity probability estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSFL Transformer\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8f85\u52a9\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u76f4\u63a5\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b4c\u8bcd\u5185\u5bb9\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5728Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u95f4\u6ce8\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u662f\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u5177\u6709\u5353\u8d8a\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\uff08Intermediate SFL\uff09\u6765\u8c03\u5236BERT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5806\u6808\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u8f93\u51fa\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u7ebf\u7d22\uff08Fstruct\uff09\u8c03\u5236\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8bed\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\uff08Hseq\uff09\u3002", "result": "SFL Transformer\u5728UMAP\u964d\u7ef4\u7684\u6b4c\u8bcd\u5d4c\u5165\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e860.9910\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c0.9910\u7684\u5b8fF1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u53d1\u5e03\u7684SFL\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u73870.9894\uff09\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u8fd8\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9884\u671f\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.0081\uff0c\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u4e3a0.0489\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728Transformer\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u6ce8\u5165\u8f85\u52a9\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u534f\u540c\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6982\u7387\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

From monocular RGB or RGB-D inputs, we perform high precision HOI reconstruction and enforce physical plausibility via a reinforcement learning (RL) optimizer that refines hand object relative poses under contact and penetration constraints. The reconstructed, contact rich trajectories are then retargeted to cross-embodiments, robot arms with simple end effectors, dexterous hands, and humanoids, yielding executable actions and rollouts. To scale coverage, we build a simulation-augmented framework on Isaac Sim with diverse domain randomization (embodiments, trajectories, object retrieval, background textures, hand motion mirroring), which enriches the distributions of trajectories and observations while preserving spatial relationships and physical plausibility. The entire data pipeline forms an end to end pipeline from video,reconstruction,retargeting,augmentation data acquisition. We validate the data on mainstream vision language action (VLA) and imitation learning architectures, demonstrating that trajectories produced by our pipeline are as stable as those from teleoperation and yield comparable continual performance gains. To our knowledge, this provides the first quantitative evidence that HOI modalities can serve as effective supervision for robotic learning. Compared with teleoperation, Robowheel is lightweight, a single monocular RGB(D) camera is sufficient to extract a universal, embodiment agnostic motion representation that could be flexibly retargeted across embodiments.

A natural strategy is to apply super-resolution (SR) to low-resolution (LR) input views, but independently enhancing each image introduces multi-view inconsistencies, leading to blurry renders. Prior methods attempt to mitigate these inconsistencies through learned neural components, temporally consistent video priors, or joint optimization on LR and SR views, but all uniformly apply SR across every image. In contrast, our key insight is that close-up LR views may contain high-frequency information for regions also captured in more distant views, and that we can use the camera pose relative to scene geometry to inform where to add SR content. Building from this insight, we propose SplatSuRe, a method that selectively applies SR content only in undersampled regions lacking high-frequency supervision, yielding sharper and more consistent results.

We present an explainable, few-shot AI4E framework that is systematically informed by physics and expert knowledge throughout its architecture. Starting from only 32 experimental samples in an aerial K439B superalloy castings repair welding case, we first augment physically plausible synthetic data through a three-stage protocol: differentiated noise injection calibrated to process variabilities, enforcement of hard physical constraints, and preservation of inter-parameter relationships. We then employ a nested optimization strategy for constitutive model discovery, where symbolic regression explores equation structures while differential evolution optimizes parameters, followed by intensive parameter refinement using hybrid global-local optimization. The resulting interpretable constitutive equation achieves 88% accuracy in predicting hot-cracking tendency.

Existing learning based approaches struggle to capture rare but safety critical behaviors, while rule based systems often lack adaptability in complex interactions. To address these limitations, CogDrive introduces a cognition driven multimodal prediction and planning framework that integrates explicit modal reasoning with safety aware trajectory optimization. The prediction module adopts cognitive representations of interaction modes based on topological motion semantics and nearest neighbor relational encoding. With a differentiable modal loss and multimodal Gaussian decoding, CogDrive learns sparse and unbalanced interaction behaviors and improves long horizon trajectory prediction. The planning module incorporates an emergency response concept and optimizes safety stabilized trajectories, where short term consistent branches ensure safety during replanning cycles and long term branches support smooth and collision free motion under low probability switching modes. Experiments on Argoverse2 and INTERACTION datasets show that CogDrive achieves strong performance in trajectory accuracy and miss rate, while closed loop simulations confirm adaptive behavior in merge and intersection scenarios. By combining cognitive multimodal prediction with safety oriented planning, CogDrive offers an interpretable and reliable paradigm for safe autonomy in complex traffic.", "AI": {"tldr": "CogDrive\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba4\u77e5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u611f\u77e5\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u7f55\u89c1\u4f46\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u62d3\u6251\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u5173\u7cfb\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6a21\u6001\u635f\u5931\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u89e3\u7801\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u89c4\u5212\u6a21\u5757\u5f15\u5165\u7d27\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u77ed\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u652f\u786e\u4fdd\u91cd\u89c4\u5212\u5468\u671f\u5185\u7684\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u957f\u671f\u5206\u652f\u652f\u6301\u4f4e\u6982\u7387\u5207\u6362\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u5728Argoverse2\u548cINTERACTION\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCogDrive\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6f0f\u68c0\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u95ed\u73af\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u6c47\u5165\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u89c4\u5212\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cCogDrive\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Current literature for tackling generalisation on out-of-distribution data and domain gaps due to modality changes has been widely researched but mostly for natural scene data. However, these methods cannot be directly applied to the surgical scenes due to limited visual cues and often extremely diverse scenarios compared to the natural scene data. Inspired by these works in natural scenes to push generalisability on OOD data, we hypothesise that exploiting the style and content information in the surgical scenes could minimise the appearances, making it less variable to sudden changes such as blood or imaging artefacts. This can be achieved by performing instance normalisation and feature covariance mapping techniques for robust and generalisable feature representations. Further, to eliminate the risk of removing salient feature representation associated with the objects of interest, we introduce a restitution module within the feature learning ResNet backbone that can enable the retention of useful task-relevant features. To tackle the lack of multiclass and multicentre data for surgical scene segmentation, we also provide a newly curated dataset that can be vital for addressing generalisability in this domain. Our proposed RobustSurg obtained nearly 23% improvement on the baseline DeepLabv3+ and from 10-32% improvement on the SOTA in terms of mean IoU score on an unseen centre HeiCholSeg dataset when trained on CholecSeg8K.

However, the dominant frequencies in time series may shift with the evolving spectral distribution of the data. Traditional Mixture of Experts (MoE) models, which employ a fixed number of experts, struggle to adapt to these changes, resulting in frequency coverage imbalance issue. Specifically, too few experts can lead to the overlooking of critical information, while too many can introduce noise. To this end, we propose Ada-MoGE, an adaptive Gaussian Mixture of Experts model. Ada-MoGE integrates spectral intensity and frequency response to adaptively determine the number of experts, ensuring alignment with the input data's frequency distribution. This approach prevents both information loss due to an insufficient number of experts and noise contamination from an excess of experts. Additionally, to prevent noise introduction from direct band truncation, we employ Gaussian band-pass filtering to smoothly decompose the frequency domain features, further optimizing the feature representation.

Additionally, existing failure datasets are mostly generated programmatically in simulation, which limits their generalization to the real world. In light of these, we introduce ViFailback, a framework designed to diagnose robotic manipulation failures and provide both textual and visual correction guidance. Our framework utilizes explicit visual symbols to enhance annotation efficiency. We further release the ViFailback dataset, a large-scale collection of 58,126 Visual Question Answering (VQA) pairs along with their corresponding 5,202 real-world manipulation trajectories. Based on the dataset, we establish ViFailback-Bench, a benchmark of 11 fine-grained VQA tasks designed to assess the failure diagnosis and correction abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), featuring ViFailback-Bench Lite for closed-ended and ViFailback-Bench Hard for open-ended evaluation. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we built the ViFailback-8B VLM, which not only achieves significant overall performance improvement on ViFailback-Bench but also generates visual symbols for corrective action guidance. Finally, by integrating ViFailback-8B with a VLA model, we conduct real-world robotic experiments demonstrating its ability to assist the VLA model in recovering from failures.

Existing end-to-end multifractal methods rely on heavy pooling or strong feature-space decimation, which constrain tasks such as semantic segmentation. Motivated by these limitations, we introduce two inductive priors: Monofractal and Multifractal Recalibration. These methods leverage relationships between the probability mass of the exponents and the multifractal spectrum to form statistical descriptions of encoder embeddings, implemented as channel-attention functions in convolutional networks.\n  Using a U-Net-based framework, we show that multifractal recalibration yields substantial gains over a baseline equipped with other channel-attention mechanisms that also use higher-order statistics. Given the proven ability of multifractal analysis to capture pathological regularities, we validate our approach on three public medical-imaging datasets: ISIC18 (dermoscopy), Kvasir-SEG (endoscopy), and BUSI (ultrasound).\n  Our empirical analysis also provides insights into the behavior of these attention layers.

While Transformer-based models effectively capture long-range dependencies, they often suffer from quadratic complexity and overfitting due to data sparsity. Conversely, efficient linear models struggle to depict complex non-linear local dynamics. Furthermore, existing multi-scale frameworks typically rely on average pooling, which acts as a non-ideal low-pass filter, leading to spectral aliasing and the irreversible loss of high-frequency transients. In response, this paper proposes DPWMixer, a computationally efficient Dual-Path architecture. The framework is built upon a Lossless Haar Wavelet Pyramid that replaces traditional pooling, utilizing orthogonal decomposition to explicitly disentangle trends and local fluctuations without information loss. To process these components, we design a Dual-Path Trend Mixer that integrates a global linear mapping for macro-trend anchoring and a flexible patch-based MLP-Mixer for micro-dynamic evolution. Finally, An adaptive multi-scale fusion module then integrates predictions from diverse scales, weighted by channel stationarity to optimize synthesis.

This research introduces the LangGraph-based Task Allocation Agent (LTAA), an LLM-driven framework that integrates phase-adaptive allocation strategies, multi-stage validation with hierarchical retries, and dynamic prompting for efficient robot coordination. Although recent LLM approaches show potential for construction robotics, they largely lack rigorous validation and benchmarking against established algorithms. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of LLM-based task allocation with traditional methods in construction scenarios.The study validates LLM feasibility through SMART-LLM replication and addresses implementation challenges using a Self-Corrective Agent Architecture. LTAA leverages natural-language reasoning combined with structured validation mechanisms, achieving major computational gains reducing token usage by 94.6% and allocation time by 86% through dynamic prompting. The framework adjusts its strategy across phases: emphasizing execution feasibility early and workload balance in later allocations.The authors evaluate LTAA against Dynamic Programming, Q-learning, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) baselines using construction operations from the TEACh human-robot collaboration dataset. In the Heavy Excels setting, where robots have strong task specializations, LTAA achieves 77% task completion with superior workload balance, outperforming all traditional methods. These findings show that LLM-based reasoning with structured validation can match established optimization algorithms while offering additional advantages such as interpretability, adaptability, and the ability to update task logic without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLangGraph\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4ee3\u7406\uff08LTAA\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2aLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1LLM\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "LTAA\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u91cd\u8bd5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u6280\u672f\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Self-Corrective Agent Architecture\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u578b\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0cLTAA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8677%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6240\u6709\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u51cf\u5c1194.6%\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1186%\u3002\u5728\u8d1f\u8f7d\u5747\u8861\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e0e\u6210\u719f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u66f4\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u989d\u5916\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

These approaches cannot provide diagnostic, interpretable feedback, offering little insight into why the video quality is degraded. Most of them are also specialized, format-specific metrics rather than truly ``generic\" solutions, as they are designed to learn a compromised representation from disparate perceptual domains. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Unified-VQA, a framework that provides a single, unified quality model applicable to various distortion types within multiple video formats by recasting generic VQA as a Diagnostic Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) problem. Unified-VQA employs multiple ``perceptual experts'' dedicated to distinct perceptual domains. A novel multi-proxy expert training strategy is designed to optimize each expert using a ranking-inspired loss, guided by the most suitable proxy metric for its domain. We also integrated a diagnostic multi-task head into this framework to generate a global quality score and an interpretable multi-dimensional artifact vector, which is optimized using a weakly-supervised learning strategy, leveraging the known properties of the large-scale training database generated for this work. With static model parameters (without retraining or fine-tuning), Unified-VQA demonstrates consistent and superior performance compared to over 18 benchmark methods for both generic VQA and diagnostic artifact detection tasks across 17 databases containing diverse streaming artifacts in HD, UHD, HDR and HFR formats.

However, existing GCL approaches with structural augmentations often struggle to identify task-relevant topological structures, let alone adapt to the varying coarse-to-fine topological granularities required across different downstream tasks. To remedy this issue, we introduce Hierarchical Topological Granularity Graph Contrastive Learning (HTG-GCL), a novel framework that leverages transformations of the same graph to generate multi-scale ring-based cellular complexes, embodying the concept of topological granularity, thereby generating diverse topological views. Recognizing that a certain granularity may contain misleading semantics, we propose a multi-granularity decoupled contrast and apply a granularity-specific weighting mechanism based on uncertainty estimation. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of HTG-GCL, highlighting its superior performance in capturing meaningful graph representations through hierarchical topological information.", "AI": {"tldr": "HTG-GCL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u73af\u5f62\u7ec6\u80de\u590d\u5f62\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u4e0d\u540c\u62d3\u6251\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5bf9\u7c97\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u540c\u4e00\u56fe\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u751f\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u73af\u5f62\u7ec6\u80de\u590d\u5f62\uff0c\u4f53\u73b0\u62d3\u6251\u7c92\u5ea6\u6982\u5ff5\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u5bf9\u6bd4\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5b9a\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86HTG-GCL\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u62d3\u6251\u4fe1\u606f\u6355\u83b7\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "HTG-GCL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709GCL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7c92\u5ea6\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yang Zhang leads the whole project", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \\textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process.

Comprehensive evaluations show that the Gemini family consistently outperforms open-source systems, with Gemini 2.5 Pro achieving the best results.

To address three core challenges in real-world scenarios: limited and non-IID data, effective extraction and fusion of multi-modal information, and susceptibility to catastrophic forgetting in model learning, a task-driven supervised multi-modal federated feature extraction method is proposed. The method integrates multi-modal information extraction and contrastive learning mechanisms, and can adapt to different neural network structures as the latent mapping functions for data of each modality. It supports each client to independently learn low-dimensional representations of multi-modal data, and can flexibly control the degree of retention of effective information about the response variable in the predictive variables within the low-dimensional features through parameter tuning. The multi-constraint learning framework constructed by the method guarantees regression accuracy using Mean Squared Error loss. Through the synergistic effect of mutual information preservation constraint, symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence constraint, and inter-model contrastive constraint, it achieves the retention of task-related information, the extraction, fusion, and alignment of multi-modal features, and the mitigation of representation drift and catastrophic forgetting in non-IID scenarios, respectively. This ensures that the feature extraction process always centers on improving the performance of downstream regression tasks. Experimental results from simulations and real-world data analysis demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more significant performance improvement on downstream regression tasks compared with classical feature extraction techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u56de\u5f52\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u906d\u53d7\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6620\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u3001\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0KL\u6563\u5ea6\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u5b9e\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u786e\u4fdd\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u56f4\u7ed5\u63d0\u5347\u4e0b\u6e38\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u786e\u4fdd\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5173\u952e\u6027\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u7684\u957f\u5c3e\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u88ab\u6d4b\u8f66\u8f86\u5b9e\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e09\u5c42\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u6218\u7565\u5c42\uff08VLM\u6307\u5bfc\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u786e\u5b9a\uff09\u3001\u6218\u672f\u5c42\uff08\u5f15\u5bfc\u51fd\u6570\u5236\u5b9a\uff09\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5c42\uff08\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6267\u884c\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u8f66\u8f86\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548cVLM\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u573a\u666f\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose SwarmDiffusion, a lightweight end-to-end diffusion model that jointly predicts traversability and generates a feasible trajectory from a single RGB image. To remove the need for annotated or planner-produced paths, we introduce a planner-free trajectory construction pipeline based on randomized waypoint sampling, Bezier smoothing, and regularization enforcing connectivity, safety, directionality, and path thinness. This enables learning stable motion priors without demonstrations. SwarmDiffusion leverages VLM-derived supervision without prompt engineering and conditions the diffusion process on a compact embodiment state, producing physically consistent, traversable paths that transfer across different robot platforms. Across indoor environments and two embodiments (quadruped and aerial), the method achieves 80-100\\% navigation success and 0.09 s inference, and adapts to a new robot using only-500 additional visual samples.

Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

This paper offers a thorough analysis of four pricing algorithms -- Q-Learning, PSO, Double DQN, and DDPG -- across three classic duopoly models (Logit, Hotelling, Linear) and under various demand-shock regimes created by auto-regressive processes. By utilizing profit- and price-based collusion indices, we investigate how the interactions among algorithms, market structure, and stochastic demand collaboratively influence competitive outcomes. Our findings reveal that reinforcement-learning algorithms often sustain supra-competitive prices under stable demand, with DDPG demonstrating the most pronounced collusive tendencies. Demand shocks produce notably varied effects: Logit markets suffer significant performance declines, Hotelling markets remain stable, and Linear markets experience shock-induced profit inflation. Despite marked changes in absolute performance, the relative rankings of the algorithms are consistent across different environments. These results underscore the critical importance of market structure and demand uncertainty in shaping algorithmic competition, while also contributing to the evolving policy discussions surrounding autonomous pricing behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u7ecf\u5178\u53cc\u5be1\u5934\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u8d85\u7ade\u4e89\u4ef7\u683c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u51fb\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u5f71\u54cd\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u9700\u6c42\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5171\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\u7ade\u4e89\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56db\u79cd\u5b9a\u4ef7\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08Q-Learning\u3001PSO\u3001Double DQN\u3001DDPG\uff09\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u53cc\u5be1\u5934\u6a21\u578b\uff08Logit\u3001Hotelling\u3001Linear\uff09\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u62df\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5229\u6da6\u548c\u4ef7\u683c\u57fa\u7684\u5408\u8c0b\u6307\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ade\u4e89\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u9700\u6c42\u4e0b\u7ef4\u6301\u8d85\u7ade\u4e89\u4ef7\u683c\uff0cDDPG\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u5408\u8c0b\u503e\u5411\uff1b\u9700\u6c42\u51b2\u51fb\u5bf9Logit\u5e02\u573a\u9020\u6210\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0cHotelling\u5e02\u573a\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cLinear\u5e02\u573a\u51fa\u73b0\u51b2\u51fb\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5229\u6da6\u81a8\u80c0\uff1b\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5bf9\u6392\u540d\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e02\u573a\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u9700\u6c42\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b9a\u4ef7\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u8ba8\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

We show that this brittleness primarily arises from misalignment in Spatial Modeling, rather than Physical Modeling. To address this, we propose a one-shot adaptation framework that recalibrates visual representations through lightweight, learnable updates. Our first method, Feature Token Modulation (FTM), applies a global affine transformation to visual tokens and improves Libero viewpoint accuracy from 48.5% to 87.1% with only 4K parameters. Building on this, Feature Linear Adaptation (FLA) introduces low-rank updates to the ViT encoder, achieving 90.8% success with 4.7M parameters -- matching LoRA-scale finetuning at far lower cost. Together, these results reveal substantial untapped robustness in pretrained VLA models and demonstrate that targeted, minimal visual adaptation is sufficient to restore viewpoint generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08FTM\u548cFLA\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u5f81\u6765\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6781\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u5c06Libero\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece48.5%\u63d0\u5347\u81f390.8%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u65b0\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5efa\u6a21\u800c\u975e\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) FTM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9token\u5e94\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u4eff\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\uff08\u4ec5\u97004K\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff1b2) FLA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5165\u4f4e\u79e9\u66f4\u65b0\uff084.7M\u53c2\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0eLoRA\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u66f4\u4f4e\u3002", "result": "FTM\u5c06Libero\u89c6\u89d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece48.5%\u63d0\u5347\u81f387.1%\uff1bFLA\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u81f390.8%\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u53c2\u6570\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5927\u91cf\u672a\u88ab\u6316\u6398\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u89c6\u89c9\u9002\u5e94\u5373\u53ef\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u89c6\u89d2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In this work, we repurpose CogVideo for progressive visual restoration tasks by fine-tuning it to generate restoration trajectories rather than natural video motion. Specifically, we construct synthetic datasets for super-resolution, deblurring, and low-light enhancement, where each sample depicts a gradual transition from degraded to clean frames. Two prompting strategies are compared: a uniform text prompt shared across all samples, and a scene-specific prompting scheme generated via LLaVA multi-modal LLM and refined with ChatGPT. Our fine-tuned model learns to associate temporal progression with restoration quality, producing sequences that improve perceptual metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS across frames. Extensive experiments show that CogVideo effectively restores spatial detail and illumination consistency while maintaining temporal coherence. Moreover, the model generalizes to real-world scenarios on the ReLoBlur dataset without additional training, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness and interpretability through temporal restoration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u91cd\u65b0\u5229\u7528CogVideo\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u5176\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\u8f68\u8ff9\u800c\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u89c6\u9891\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4f4e\u5149\u589e\u5f3a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5c55\u793a\u4ece\u9000\u5316\u5230\u6e05\u6670\u5e27\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7edf\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eLLaVA\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u5728PSNR\u3001SSIM\u548cLPIPS\u7b49\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u5728ReLoBlur\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "CogVideo\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002"}}

Single-lead ECG recording is integrated into both clinical-grade and consumer wearables. While self-supervised pretraining of foundation models on unlabeled ECGs improves diagnostic performance, existing approaches do not incorporate domain knowledge from clinical metadata. We introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that utilizes an established clinical risk score to adaptively weight negative pairs: clinically-guided contrastive learning. It aligns the similarities of ECG embeddings with clinically meaningful differences between subjects, with an explicit mechanism to handle missing metadata. On 12-lead ECGs from 161K patients in the MIMIC-IV dataset, we pretrain single-lead ECG foundation models at three scales, collectively called CLEF, using only routinely collected metadata without requiring per-sample ECG annotations. We evaluate CLEF on 18 clinical classification and regression tasks across 7 held-out datasets, and benchmark against 5 foundation model baselines and 3 self-supervised algorithms. When pretrained on 12-lead ECG data and tested on lead-I data, CLEF outperforms self-supervised foundation model baselines: the medium-sized CLEF achieves average AUROC improvements of at least 2.6% in classification and average reductions in MAEs of at least 3.2% in regression. Comparing with existing self-supervised learning algorithms, CLEF improves the average AUROC by at least 1.8%. Moreover, when pretrained only on lead-I data for classification tasks, CLEF performs comparably to the state-of-the-art ECGFounder, which was trained in a supervised manner. Overall, CLEF enables more accurate and scalable single-lead ECG analysis, advancing remote health monitoring.

While task-space planning and control have been extensively studied for larger, arm-scale manipulators, demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in compact, multi-DoF robotic fingers remain scarce. In this paper, we present the physical prototyping and experimental characterization of a three-degree-of-freedom, linkage-driven, series-parallel robotic finger with analytic forward kinematics and a closed-form Jacobian. A resolved motion rate control (RMRC) scheme is implemented to achieve closed-loop task-space trajectory tracking. We experimentally evaluate the fingertip tracking performance across a variety of trajectories, including straight lines, circles, and more complex curves, and report millimeter-level accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides one of the first systematic experimental demonstrations of precise task-space trajectory tracking in a linkage-driven robotic finger, thereby establishing a benchmark for future designs aimed at dexterous in-hand manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e09\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u4e32\u8054\u5e76\u8054\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u578b\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u4e3a\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5185\u64cd\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u64cd\u4f5c\u76ee\u6807\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u5c16\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u65bd\u52a0\u529b\u6765\u6307\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u4e2a\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u3002\u867d\u7136\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5df2\u5728\u5927\u578b\u673a\u68b0\u81c2\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u591a\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\u4e2d\u7cbe\u786e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6f14\u793a\u4ecd\u7136\u5f88\u5c11\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u5236\u9020\u4e86\u4e09\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u3001\u8fde\u6746\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e32\u8054\u5e76\u8054\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u89e3\u6790\u6b63\u5411\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u89e3\u6790\u8fd0\u52a8\u901f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\uff08RMRC\uff09\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u73af\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u6307\u5c16\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u7ebf\u3001\u5706\u5f62\u548c\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u66f2\u7ebf\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6beb\u7c73\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u6746\u9a71\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u6307\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u5de7\u624b\u5185\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

Recent methods employ video diffusion models (VDMs) to enhance robotic policies, improving their understanding and modeling of the physical world. However, existing approaches overlook the coherent and physically consistent motion representations inherently encoded across frames in VDMs. To this end, we propose Video2Act, a framework that efficiently guides robotic action learning by explicitly integrating spatial and motion-aware representations. Building on the inherent representations of VDMs, we extract foreground boundaries and inter-frame motion variations while filtering out background noise and task-irrelevant biases. These refined representations are then used as additional conditioning inputs to a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head, enabling it to reason about what to manipulate and how to move. To mitigate inference inefficiency, we propose an asynchronous dual-system design, where the VDM functions as the slow System 2 and the DiT head as the fast System 1, working collaboratively to generate adaptive actions. By providing motion-aware conditions to System 1, Video2Act maintains stable manipulation even with low-frequency updates from the VDM. For evaluation, Video2Act surpasses previous state-of-the-art VLA methods by 7.7% in simulation and 21.7% in real-world tasks in terms of average success rate, further exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Video2Act\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8de8\u5e27\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u524d\u666f\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u5e27\u95f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u80cc\u666f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u52a8\u4f5c\u5934\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5f02\u6b65\u53cc\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "Video2Act\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u53477.7%\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u534721.7%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u6574\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\uff0cVideo2Act\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u9002\u5408\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u533a\u5206\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd0\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u533a\u5206\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5668\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u6a21\u7cca\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7279\u6027\u2014\u2014\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u79bb\u51fa\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e0e\u540e\u671f\u5916\u89c2\u7ec6\u5316\u76f8\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u53d6\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u7528\u4e8e\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u8ddf\u8e2a\u751a\u81f3\u5b8c\u5168\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5929\u7136\u5177\u5907\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd0\u52a8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u4f3c\u7269\u4f53\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8584\u5f31\u73af\u8282\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \\& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications.

However, when deployed in online settings such as driving scenarios, predictions are made over temporal windows, making it non-trivial to maintain consistency across time. Recent strategies align consecutive predictions by solving global transformation, yet our analysis reveals their fundamental limitations in assumption validity, local alignment scope, and robustness under noisy geometry. In this work, we propose a higher-DOF and long-term alignment framework based on Thin Plate Spline, leveraging globally propagated control points to correct spatially varying inconsistencies. In addition, we adopt a point-agnostic submap registration design that is inherently robust to noisy geometry predictions. The proposed framework is fully plug-and-play, compatible with diverse 3D foundation models and camera configurations (e.g., monocular or surround-view). Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields more coherent geometry and lower trajectory errors across multiple datasets, backbone models, and camera setups, highlighting its robustness and generality.

Improving the interpretability of CNNs is thus of great importance for their development and deployment in SAR. In this paper, a visual explanation method termed multi-weight self-matching class activation mapping (MS-CAM) is proposed. MS-CAM matches SAR images with the feature maps and corresponding gradients extracted by the CNN, and combines both channel-wise and element-wise weights to visualize the decision basis learned by the model in SAR images. Extensive experiments conducted on a self-constructed SAR target classification dataset demonstrate that MS-CAM more accurately highlights the network's regions of interest and captures detailed target feature information, thereby enhancing network interpretability. Furthermore, the feasibility of applying MS-CAM to weakly-supervised obiect localization is validated.

However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency.

Recent efforts pursue unified multimodal models that integrate heterogeneous components to support both capabilities within a single framework. However, such unification introduces inference inefficiencies, e.g., specific tasks or samples may not require the full knowledge or capacity of the unified model. Yet, a systematic understanding of how these inefficiencies manifest across different components remains limited. In this work, we first conduct a systematic analysis of unified multimodal model components using training-free pruning as a probing methodology, considering both depth pruning and width reduction. Our study reveals that the understanding component exhibits notable compressibility in both understanding and generation tasks, which is more pronounced in the latter. In contrast, the generation components are highly sensitive to compression, with performance deteriorating sharply even under moderate compression ratios. To address this limitation, we propose the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Adaptation, inspired by the dynamic activation patterns observed across different samples. This approach partitions the generation module into multiple experts and enables sparse activation to restore generation quality. We validate the effectiveness of sparse activation through expert-frozen tuning and further demonstrate that a fully trainable adaptation delivers additional gains. As a result, the adapted BAGEL model achieves performance comparable to the full model while activating only about half of its parameters.

Existing generative frameworks, however, often treat all spatial regions uniformly, overlooking the varying uncertainty across real-world scenes. This uniform generation leads to artifacts in complex or ambiguous regions, limiting realism and temporal stability. In this work, we present U4D, an uncertainty-aware framework for 4D LiDAR world modeling. Our approach first estimates spatial uncertainty maps from a pretrained segmentation model to localize semantically challenging regions. It then performs generation in a \"hard-to-easy\" manner through two sequential stages: (1) uncertainty-region modeling, which reconstructs high-entropy regions with fine geometric fidelity, and (2) uncertainty-conditioned completion, which synthesizes the remaining areas under learned structural priors.

Existing deep-learning multi-view crowd counting methods project different camera view images onto a common space to obtain ground-plane density maps, requiring abundant and costly crowd annotations and camera calibrations. Hence, calibration-free methods are proposed that do not require camera calibrations and scene-level crowd annotations. However, existing calibration-free methods still require expensive image-level crowd annotations for training the single-view counting module. Thus, in this paper, we propose a weakly-supervised calibration-free multi-view crowd counting method (WSCF-MVCC), directly using crowd count as supervision for the single-view counting module rather than density maps constructed from crowd annotations. Instead, a self-supervised ranking loss that leverages multi-scale priors is utilized to enhance the model's perceptual ability without additional annotation costs. What's more, the proposed model leverages semantic information to achieve a more accurate view matching and, consequently, a more precise scene-level crowd count estimation. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on three widely used multi-view counting datasets under weakly supervised settings, indicating that it is more suitable for practical deployment compared with calibrated methods.

While their accuracy is exceptional in flat regions, the capturing is susceptible to miss small geometric structures and may fail with dark, absorbent materials. Alternatively, capturing multiple photos of the scene and applying 3D photogrammetry can infer these details as they often represent feature-rich regions. However, the accuracy of LiDAR for featureless regions is rarely reached. Therefore, we suggest combining the strengths of LiDAR and camera-based capture by introducing SurfFill: a Gaussian surfel-based LiDAR completion scheme. We analyze LiDAR capturings and attribute LiDAR beam divergence as a main factor for artifacts, manifesting mostly at thin structures and edges. We use this insight to introduce an ambiguity heuristic for completed scans by evaluating the change in density in the point cloud. This allows us to identify points close to missed areas, which we can then use to grow additional points from to complete the scan. For this point growing, we constrain Gaussian surfel reconstruction [Huang et al. 2024] to focus optimization and densification on these ambiguous areas. Finally, Gaussian primitives of the reconstruction in ambiguous areas are extracted and sampled for points to complete the point cloud. To address the challenges of large-scale reconstruction, we extend this pipeline with a divide-and-conquer scheme for building-sized point cloud completion. We evaluate on the task of LiDAR point cloud completion of synthetic and real-world scenes and find that our method outperforms previous reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SurfFill\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f18\u52bf\u7684Gaussian surfel\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790LiDAR\u5149\u675f\u53d1\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u751f\u957f\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "LiDAR\u5728\u5e73\u5766\u533a\u57df\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u6613\u9057\u6f0f\u5c0f\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6697\u8272\u6750\u6599\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u800c\u6444\u5f71\u6d4b\u91cf\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u8282\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u53ef\u4e92\u8865\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "1) \u5206\u6790LiDAR\u5149\u675f\u53d1\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u5bc6\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\uff1b3) \u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u7ea6\u675fGaussian surfel\u91cd\u5efa\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u751f\u957f\uff1b4) \u63d0\u53d6Gaussian\u57fa\u5143\u91c7\u6837\u8865\u5168\u70b9\u4e91\uff1b5) \u91c7\u7528\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SurfFill\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86LiDAR\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Gaussian surfel\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8865\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

Consequently, they may struggle with basic perception tasks that conventional models handle reliably. Given the substantial cost of pre-training and fine-tuning VLMs, continue training on augmented data yields limited and diminishing returns. In this paper, we present Visual Augmentation Chain-of-Thought (VACoT), a framework that dynamically invokes image augmentations during model inference. By incorporating post-hoc transformations such as denoising, VACoT substantially improves robustness on challenging and out-of-distribution inputs, especially in OCR-related adversarial scenarios. Distinct from prior approaches limited to local cropping, VACoT integrates a structured collection of general visual augmentations, broadening the query image views while reducing training complexity and computational overhead with efficient agentic reinforcement learning. We propose a conditional reward scheme that encourages necessary augmentation while penalizing verbose responses, ensuring concise and effective reasoning in perception tasks. We demonstrate the superiority of VACoT with extensive experiments on 13 perception benchmarks and further introduce AdvOCR to highlight the generalization benefits of post-hoc visual augmentations in adversarial scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "VACoT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u6362\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728OCR\u76f8\u5173\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5408\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u57fa\u672c\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u4e14\u6536\u76ca\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVACoT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982\u53bb\u566a\uff09\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u667a\u80fd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u572813\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165AdvOCR\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u540e\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "VACoT\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

TB, a persistent infectious disease affecting humanity for millennia, poses challenges in diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings. Traditional methods, such as sputum smear microscopy and culture, are inefficient, prompting the exploration of advanced technologies like deep learning and computer vision. The study utilized a dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 4,200 chest X-rays, to develop and compare the performance of the two machine learning models. Preprocessing involved data splitting, augmentation, and resizing to enhance training efficiency. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix, were employed to assess model performance. Results showcase that the SqueezeNet achieved a loss of 32%, accuracy of 89%, precision of 98%, recall of 80%, and an F1 score of 87%. In contrast, the ResNet-50 model exhibited a loss of 54%, accuracy of 73%, precision of 88%, recall of 52%, and an F1 score of 65%. This study emphasizes the potential of machine learning in TB detection and possible implications for early identification and treatment initiation. The possibility of integrating such models into mobile devices expands their utility in areas lacking TB detection resources.

While it is known that improving fairness can affect predictive performance, little is known about how fairness improvements influence explainability, an essential ingredient for clinical trust. Clinicians may hesitate to rely on a model whose explanations shift after fairness constraints are applied. In this study, we examine how enhancing fairness through bias mitigation techniques reshapes Shapley-based feature rankings. We quantify changes in feature importance rankings after applying fairness constraints across three datasets: pediatric urinary tract infection risk, direct anticoagulant bleeding risk, and recidivism risk.

This yields lower bounds for TL-Q via the reduction from learning to refutation given in [KL18].

However, in many real-world scenarios, we are unable to access the model parameters and architectural details due to privacy concerns and security constraints. Traditional fine-tuning or adaptation is hindered, leading to the demand for input-level strategies that can enhance generalization without modifying model weights. To this end, we propose a \\textbf{S}tyle-\\textbf{A}daptive \\textbf{GE}neralization framework (\\textbf{SAGE}), which improves the generalization of frozen models under privacy constraints. SAGE learns to synthesize visual prompts that implicitly align feature distributions across styles instead of directly fine-tuning the backbone. Specifically, we first utilize style transfer to construct a diverse style representation of the source domain, thereby learning a set of style characteristics that can cover a wide range of visual features.

Through this closed-loop design, SAGE effectively bridges the gap between frozen model invariance and the diversity of unseen domains.

We investigate this by deriving a principled measure of equivariance error that, for convex losses, calculates the percent of total loss attributable to imperfections in learned symmetry. We focus our empirical investigation to 3D-rotation equivariance on high-dimensional molecular tasks (flow matching, force field prediction, denoising voxels) and find that models reduce equivariance error quickly to $\\leq$2\\% held-out loss within 1k-10k training steps, a result robust to model and dataset size. This happens because learning 3D-rotational equivariance is an easier learning task, with a smoother and better-conditioned loss landscape, than the main prediction task. For 3D rotations, the loss penalty for non-equivariant models is small throughout training, so they may achieve lower test loss than equivariant models per GPU-hour unless the equivariant ``efficiency gap'' is narrowed.

However, most existing methods focus on processing captured images or sequential frames in real time, without explicitly evaluating the quality of the on-the-go 3D reconstruction or providing guided feedback to enhance image acquisition in the target area. This work presents On-the-fly Feedback SfM, an explore-and-exploit framework for real-time UAV photogrammetry, enabling iterative exploration of unseen regions and exploitation of already observed and reconstructed areas in near real time. Built upon SfM on-the-fly , the proposed method integrates three modules: (1) online incremental coarse-mesh generation for dynamically expanding sparse 3D point cloud; (2) online mesh quality assessment with actionable indicators; and (3) predictive path planning for on-the-fly trajectory refinement. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves in-situ reconstruction and evaluation in near real time while providing actionable feedback that markedly reduces coverage gaps and re-flight costs. Via the integration of data collection, processing, 3D reconstruction and assessment, and online feedback, our on the-fly feedback SfM could be an alternative for the transition from traditional passive working mode to a more intelligent and adaptive exploration workflow.

More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM).

Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy.

We study online classification in non-stationary environments and propose Retrieval-Augmented Memory for Online Learning (RAM-OL), a simple extension of stochastic gradient descent that maintains a small buffer of past examples. At each time step, RAM-OL retrieves a few nearest neighbours of the current input in the hidden representation space and updates the model jointly on the current example and the retrieved neighbours. We compare a naive replay variant with a gated replay variant that constrains neighbours using a time window, similarity thresholds, and gradient reweighting, in order to balance fast reuse of relevant past data against robustness to outdated regimes. From a theoretical perspective, we interpret RAM-OL under a bounded drift model and discuss how retrieval can reduce adaptation cost and improve regret constants when patterns recur over time. Empirically, we instantiate RAM-OL on a simple online multilayer perceptron and evaluate it on three real-world data streams derived from electricity pricing, electricity load, and airline delay data. On strongly and periodically drifting streams, RAM-OL improves prequential accuracy by up to about seven percentage points and greatly reduces variance across random seeds, while on a noisy airline stream the gated variant closely matches the purely online baseline.

The RaDelft data set, although seminal, provides only LiDAR annotations and no public code to generate radar labels, limiting reproducibility and downstream research. In this work, we reproduce the numerical results of the RaDelft group and demonstrate that a camera-guided radar labeling pipeline can generate accurate labels for radar point clouds without relying on human annotations. By projecting radar point clouds into camera-based semantic segmentation and applying spatial clustering, we create labels that significantly enhance the accuracy of radar labels. These results establish a reproducible framework that allows the research community to train and evaluate the labeled 4D radar data.

However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6ce2\u58eb\u987fMBTA\u5730\u94c1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff08\u4ee5\u95f8\u673a\u5165\u53e3\u6570\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\uff09\u548c\u5ef6\u8bef\u6b21\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u65e5\u671f\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "motivation": "MBTA\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u5ef6\u8bef\u548c\u5ba2\u6d41\u6ce2\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e58\u5ba2\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u5584\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u752810\u79cd\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u94c1\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\uff0c11\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u5ef6\u8bef\u6b21\u6570\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u81ea\u6fc0\u52b1\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u65e5\u671f\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u3001\u5929\u6c14\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RMSE\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e5\u671f\u6216\u5b63\u8282\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u66f4\u6709\u76ca\uff0c\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u516c\u5171\u4ea4\u901a\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5ef6\u8bef\u65f6\uff0c\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u65e5\u671f\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5929\u6c14\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002"}}

Speculative decoding is one of the most direct and effective approaches for accelerating generation. It follows a draft-verify paradigm, where a lightweight draft model proposes several candidate tokens and the target model verifies them. However, we find that as the context length grows, verification becomes the dominant bottleneck. To further accelerate speculative decoding in long-context generation, we introduce SpecPV, a self-speculative decoding approach that performs fast verification using partial key-value states (KV) and periodically applies full verification to eliminate accumulated errors.

To address these challenges, we propose Nav-$R^2$, a framework that explicitly models two critical types of relationships, target-environment modeling and environment-action planning, through structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning coupled with a Similarity-Aware Memory. We construct a Nav$R^2$-CoT dataset that teaches the model to perceive the environment, focus on target-related objects in the surrounding context and finally make future action plans. Our SA-Mem preserves the most target-relevant and current observation-relevant features from both temporal and semantic perspectives by compressing video frames and fusing historical observations, while introducing no additional parameters. Compared to previous methods, Nav-R^2 achieves state-of-the-art performance in localizing unseen objects through a streamlined and efficient pipeline, avoiding overfitting to seen object categories while maintaining real-time inference at 2Hz.

Albeit with some advancement, we find that the performance of most existing offline FRL methods drops dramatically when provided with mixed-quality data, that is, the logging behaviors (offline data) are collected by policies with varying qualities across clients. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a new vote-based offline FRL framework, named FOVA. It exploits a \\emph{vote mechanism} to identify high-return actions during local policy evaluation, alleviating the negative effect of low-quality behaviors from diverse local learning policies. Besides, building on advantage-weighted regression (AWR), we construct consistent local and global training objectives, significantly enhancing the efficiency and stability of FOVA. Further, we conduct an extensive theoretical analysis and rigorously show that the policy learned by FOVA enjoys strict policy improvement over the behavioral policy.

Our setup enables generalizing the debate protocol with heterogeneous experts that possess single- and multi-modal capabilities. To this end, we present Weighted Iterative Society-of-Experts (WISE), a generalized and modular MAD framework that partitions the agents into Solvers, that generate solutions, and Reflectors, that verify correctness, assign weights, and provide natural language feedback. To aggregate the agents' solutions across debate rounds, while accounting for variance in their responses and the feedback weights, we present a modified Dawid-Skene algorithm for post-processing that integrates our two-stage debate model. We evaluate WISE on SMART-840, VisualPuzzles, EvoChart-QA, and a new SMART-840++ dataset with programmatically generated problem instances of controlled difficulty.

We introduce GPOMDP, a REINFORCE-like algorithm for estimating an approximation to the gradient of the average reward as a function of the parameters of a stochastic policy. The algorithm's chief advantages are that it requires only a single sample path of the underlying Markov chain, it uses only one free parameter $\u03b2\\in [0,1)$, which has a natural interpretation in terms of bias-variance trade-off, and it requires no knowledge of the underlying state. We prove convergence of GPOMDP and show how the gradient estimates produced by GPOMDP can be used in a conjugate-gradient procedure to find local optima of the average reward.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GPOMDP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08POMDPs\uff09\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9POMDPs\u4e2d\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u4e00\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u72b6\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e14\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86GPOMDP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3cREINFORCE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u6837\u672c\u8def\u5f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u7531\u53c2\u6570\u03b2\u2208[0,1)\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GPOMDP\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5171\u8f6d\u68af\u5ea6\u6cd5\u5bfb\u627e\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "GPOMDP\u4e3aPOMDPs\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, existing methods optimized for standard metrics often struggle to detect thin structural components and yield masks with irregular boundaries, lacking the geometric precision required for subsequent vectorization. To address this issue, we introduce MitUNet, a hybrid neural network architecture specifically designed for wall segmentation tasks in the context of 3D modeling. In MitUNet, we utilize a hierarchical Mix-Transformer encoder to capture global context and a U-Net decoder enhanced with scSE attention blocks for precise boundary recovery. Furthermore, we propose an optimization strategy based on the Tversky loss function to effectively balance precision and recall. By fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the loss function, we prioritize the suppression of false positive noise along wall boundaries while maintaining high sensitivity to thin structures. Our experiments on the public CubiCasa5k dataset and a proprietary regional dataset demonstrate that the proposed approach ensures the generation of structurally correct masks with high boundary accuracy, outperforming standard single-task models.

Current methods typically fine-tune a universal model on the entire dataset, which potentially compromises the ability to generalize to unseen domains. To fill this gap, we provide a theoretical understanding of the generalization ability for VLM fine-tuning, which reveals that training multiple parameter-efficient expert models on partitioned source domains leads to better generalization than fine-tuning a universal model. Inspired by this finding, we propose a two-step domain-expert-Guided DG (GuiDG) framework. GuiDG first employs prompt tuning to obtain source domain experts, then introduces a Cross-Modal Attention module to guide the fine-tuning of the vision encoder via adaptive expert integration.

However, real-world GUI environments, such as PC software and mobile Apps, are often complex and proprietary, making it difficult to obtain the comprehensive environment information needed for agent training and evaluation. This limitation hinders systematic investigation and benchmarking of agent navigation capabilities. To address this limitation, we introduce GUI Exploration Lab, a simulation environment engine for GUI agent navigation research that enables flexible definition and composition of screens, icons, and navigation graphs, while providing full access to environment information for comprehensive agent training and evaluation. Through extensive experiments, we find that supervised fine-tuning enables effective memorization of fundamental knowledge, serving as a crucial foundation for subsequent training. Building on this, single-turn reinforcement learning further enhances generalization to unseen scenarios. Finally, multi-turn reinforcement learning encourages the development of exploration strategies through interactive trial and error, leading to further improvements in screen navigation performance. We validate our methods on both static and interactive benchmarks, demonstrating that our findings generalize effectively to real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate the advantages of reinforcement learning approaches in GUI navigation and offer practical guidance for building more capable and generalizable GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GUI Exploration Lab\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5c4f\u5e55\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5728GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684GUI\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982PC\u8f6f\u4ef6\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u5e94\u7528\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u590d\u6742\u4e14\u4e13\u6709\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u5168\u9762\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GUI Exploration Lab\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5c4f\u5e55\u3001\u56fe\u6807\u548c\u5bfc\u822a\u56fe\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7528\u4e8e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7840\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5355\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bd5\u9519\u5f00\u53d1\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GUI\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684GUI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Allocating spaces for on-street parking, further hinders traffic flow, by limiting the effective road width available for driving. With the advancement of vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity technologies, we explore how the impact of on-street parking on traffic congestion could be minimized, by dynamically configuring on-street parking spaces. Towards that end, we formulate dynamic on-street parking space configuration as an optimization problem, and we follow a data driven approach, considering the nature of our problem. Our proposed solution comprises a two-layer multi agent reinforcement learning based framework, which is inherently scalable to large road networks. The lane level agents are responsible for deciding the optimal parking space configuration for each lane, and we introduce a novel Deep Q-learning architecture which effectively utilizes long short term memory networks and graph attention networks to capture the spatio-temporal correlations evident in the given problem. The block level agents control the actions of the lane level agents and maintain a sufficient level of parking around the block. We conduct a set of comprehensive experiments using SUMO, on both synthetic data as well as real-world data from the city of Melbourne.

However, scaling them to hours- or days-long videos remains highly challenging due to limited context capacity and the loss of critical visual details during abstraction. Existing memory-augmented methods mitigate this by leveraging textual summaries of video segments, yet they heavily rely on text and fail to utilize visual evidence when reasoning over complex scenes. Moreover, retrieving from fixed temporal scales further limits their flexibility in capturing events that span variable durations. To address this, we introduce WorldMM, a novel multimodal memory agent that constructs and retrieves from multiple complementary memories, encompassing both textual and visual representations. WorldMM comprises three types of memory: episodic memory indexes factual events across multiple temporal scales, semantic memory continuously updates high-level conceptual knowledge, and visual memory preserves detailed information about scenes. During inference, an adaptive retrieval agent iteratively selects the most relevant memory source and leverages multiple temporal granularities based on the query, continuing until it determines that sufficient information has been gathered.

Mainly characterized by dimmed and blurred visions, or peripheral vision loss, glaucoma is well known to occur due to damages in the optic nerve from increased intraocular pressure (IOP) or neovascularization within the retina. Traditionally, most glaucoma related works and clinical diagnosis focused on detecting these damages in the optic nerve by using patient data from perimetry tests, optic papilla inspections and tonometer-based IOP measurements. Recently, with advancements in computer vision AI models, such as VGG16 or Vision Transformers (ViT), AI-automatized glaucoma detection and optic cup segmentation based on retinal fundus images or OCT recently exhibited significant performance in aiding conventional diagnosis with high performance. However, current AI-driven glaucoma detection approaches still have significant room for improvement in terms of reliability, excessive parameter usage, possibility of spurious correlation within detection, and limitations in applications to intervention analysis or clinical simulations. Thus, this research introduced a novel causal representation driven glaucoma detection model: LightHCG, an extremely lightweight Convolutional VAE-based latent glaucoma representation model that can consider the true causality among glaucoma-related physical factors within the optic nerve region. Using HSIC-based latent space disentanglement and Graph Autoencoder based unsupervised causal representation learning, LightHCG not only exhibits higher performance in classifying glaucoma with 93~99% less weights, but also enhances the possibility of AI-driven intervention analysis, compared to existing advanced vision models such as InceptionV3, MobileNetV2 or VGG16.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86LightHCG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7HSIC\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c1193-99%\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u9752\u5149\u773c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u3001\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u5e94\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u8003\u8651\u9752\u5149\u773c\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5377\u79efVAE\u6784\u5efa\u6f5c\u5728\u9752\u5149\u773c\u8868\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408HSIC\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u56fe\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u795e\u7ecf\u533a\u57df\u5185\u9752\u5149\u773c\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u7406\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "LightHCG\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8eInceptionV3\u3001MobileNetV2\u548cVGG16\u7b49\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1193-99%\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86AI\u9a71\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u5f81\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u9752\u5149\u773c\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e72\u9884\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between the source and target domain, simply merging the data from two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively sharing source domain samples that exhibit dynamics alignment with the target domain. However, these approaches focus solely on dynamics alignment and overlook \\textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain. In this paper, we first demonstrate that both dynamics alignment and value alignment are essential for policy learning, by examining the limitations of the current theoretical framework for cross-domain RL and establishing a concrete sub-optimality gap of a policy trained on the source domain and evaluated on the target domain.

Pretrained VLMs enable fine-tuning on small datasets or zero-shot inference, achieving performance comparable to task-specific models. Contrastive learning (CL) is a key paradigm for training VLMs but inherently requires large batch sizes for effective learning, making it computationally demanding and often limited to well-resourced institutions. Moreover, with limited data in healthcare, it is important to prioritize knowledge extraction from both data and models during training to improve performance. Therefore, we focus on leveraging the momentum method combined with distillation to simultaneously address computational efficiency and knowledge exploitation. Our contributions can be summarized as follows: (1) leveraging momentum self-distillation to enhance multimodal learning, and (2) integrating momentum mechanisms with gradient accumulation to enlarge the effective batch size without increasing resource consumption. Our method attains competitive performance with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in zero-shot classification, while providing a substantial boost in the few-shot adaption, achieving over 90% AUC-ROC and improving retrieval tasks by 2-3%. Importantly, our method achieves high training efficiency with a single GPU while maintaining reasonable training time.

At the same time, the number of task-specific pre-trained models continues to grow, yet the question of how to transfer them to new tasks with minimal additional training remains relatively underexplored. We propose BOLT (Basis-Oriented Low-rank Transfer), a framework that reuses existing fine-tuned models not by merging weights, but instead by extracting an orthogonal, task-informed spectral basis and adapting within that subspace. In the offline phase, BOLT collects dominant singular directions from multiple task vectors and orthogonalizes them per layer to form reusable bases. In the online phase, we freeze these bases and train only a small set of diagonal coefficients per layer for the new task, yielding a rank-controlled update with very few trainable parameters. This design provides (i) a strong, training-free initialization for unseen tasks, obtained by pooling source-task coefficients, along with a lightweight rescaling step while leveraging the shared orthogonal bases, and (ii) a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) path that, in our experiments, achieves robust performance compared to common PEFT baselines as well as a representative meta-learned initialization. Our results show that constraining adaptation to a task-informed orthogonal subspace provides an effective alternative for unseen-task transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "BOLT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u4ea4\u8c31\u57fa\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u8fc1\u79fb\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u590d\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u8c31\u57fa\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u7684\u5143\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u800c\u5927\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u672a\u88ab\u6709\u6548\u590d\u7528\u3002BOLT\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u91cf\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u5947\u5f02\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u6b63\u4ea4\u5316\u5f62\u6210\u53ef\u590d\u7528\u57fa\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u9636\u6bb5\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\uff0c\u4ec5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bcf\u5c42\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5bf9\u89d2\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u79e9\u63a7\u5236\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "BOLT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5f3a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u5e38\u89c1PEFT\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4fe1\u606f\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTabGRU\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5546\u7528\u5fae\u6ce2\u94fe\u8def\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9762\u5bf9\u5168\u7403\u57ce\u5e02\u5316\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u5929\u6c14\u4e8b\u4ef6\u589e\u52a0\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684CML\u964d\u96e8\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u7b49\u73b0\u5b9e\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faTabGRU\u6df7\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Transformer\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u95e8\u63a7\u5faa\u73af\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6c60\u5316\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u534f\u540c\u6355\u6349CML\u4fe1\u53f7\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u745e\u5178\u54e5\u5fb7\u5821\u7684\u516c\u5171\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u671f\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u7ea610\u4e2a\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002TabGRU\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ad9\u70b9\uff08Torp\u548cBarl\uff09\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u52300.91\u548c0.96\u7684\u51b3\u5b9a\u7cfb\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5cf0\u503c\u964d\u96e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "TabGRU\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8eCML\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u964d\u96e8\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, existing SNNs typically replicate inputs directly or aggregate them into frames at fixed intervals. Such strategies lead to neurons receiving nearly identical stimuli across time steps, severely limiting the model's expressive power, particularly in complex tasks like object detection. In this work, we propose the Temporal Dynamics Enhancer (TDE) to strengthen SNNs' capacity for temporal information modeling. TDE consists of two modules: a Spiking Encoder (SE) that generates diverse input stimuli across time steps, and an Attention Gating Module (AGM) that guides the SE generation based on inter-temporal dependencies. Moreover, to eliminate the high-energy multiplication operations introduced by the AGM, we propose a Spike-Driven Attention (SDA) to reduce attention-related energy consumption. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TDE can be seamlessly integrated into existing SNN-based detectors and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving mAP50-95 scores of 57.7% on the static PASCAL VOC dataset and 47.6% on the neuromorphic EvDET200K dataset.

However, existing studies primarily focus on train-time robustness (handling dynamics shifts from training data), neglecting the test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations when deployed in practical scenarios. In this paper, we investigate dual (both train-time and test-time) robustness against dynamics shifts in cross-domain offline RL. We first empirically show that the policy trained with cross-domain offline RL exhibits fragility under dynamics perturbations during evaluation, particularly when target domain data is limited. To address this, we introduce a novel robust cross-domain Bellman (RCB) operator, which enhances test-time robustness against dynamics perturbations while staying conservative to the out-of-distribution dynamics transitions, thus guaranteeing the train-time robustness. To further counteract potential value overestimation or underestimation caused by the RCB operator, we introduce two techniques, the dynamic value penalty and the Huber loss, into our framework, resulting in the practical \\textbf{D}ual-\\textbf{RO}bust \\textbf{C}ross-domain \\textbf{O}ffline RL (DROCO) algorithm. Extensive empirical results across various dynamics shift scenarios show that DROCO outperforms strong baselines and exhibits enhanced robustness to dynamics perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5DROCO\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff08\u5904\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u79fb\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9636\u6bb5\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u9c81\u68d2\u8de8\u57dfBellman\u7b97\u5b50\uff08RCB\uff09\u589e\u5f3a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u503c\u60e9\u7f5a\u548cHuber\u635f\u5931\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u51faDROCO\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDROCO\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DROCO\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u4e2d\u53cc\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u504f\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Specifically, we introduce an active-set Lagrangian hypergradient oracle that avoids Hessian evaluations and provides finite-time, non-asymptotic approximation guarantees.

However, capturing intra-style diversity, where a single style should correspond to diverse motion variations, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering-based framework, ClusterStyle, to address this limitation. Instead of learning an unstructured embedding from each style motion, we leverage a set of prototypes to effectively model diverse style patterns across motions belonging to the same style category. We consider two types of style diversity: global-level diversity among style motions of the same category, and local-level diversity within the temporal dynamics of motion sequences.

However, effective multimodal reasoning requires both accurate perception and robust reasoning, and weakness in either limits the performance of VLMs. Prior efforts to enhance reasoning often depend on high-quality chain-of-thought (CoT) data, obtained via labor-intensive human annotations, costly proprietary models, or self-training methods that overlook perception. To address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective self-training framework called See-Think-Learn (STL). At its core, STL introduces a structured reasoning template that encourages the model to see before thinking, first extracting visual attributes in textual form, then using them to guide reasoning. The framework jointly improves perception and reasoning by having the model generate and learn from its own structured rationales in a self-training loop. Furthermore, we augment the training data with negative rationales, i.e. explanations that justify why certain answer choices are incorrect, to enhance the model's ability to distinguish between correct and misleading responses. This fosters more discriminative and robust learning. Experiments across diverse domains show that STL consistently outperforms baselines trained directly only on answers or self-generated reasoning, while qualitative analysis confirms the high quality of its rationales. STL thus provides a cost-effective solution to enhance multimodal reasoning ability of VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSee-Think-Learn\uff08STL\uff09\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u8d1f\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u77ed\u677f\uff0c\u4e14\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5ffd\u7565\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "STL\u6846\u67b6\u5f15\u5165'\u5148\u770b\u540e\u60f3'\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u5c5e\u6027\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u6307\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u5faa\u73af\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u8d1f\u5411\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u89e3\u91ca\u9519\u8bef\u9009\u9879\u4e3a\u4f55\u4e0d\u6b63\u786e\uff09\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSTL\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u6216\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u786e\u8ba4\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "STL\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In federated learning (FL) in its naive form, often biases toward certain users, and a single global model fails to capture the statistical heterogeneity across users and BSs. In contrast, the proposed DMTFL algorithm personalizes content delivery by learning individual caching models at each BS.

Investigating Audio-Video Joint Denoising for Video Generation", "comment": "Project page at https://jianzongwu.github.io/projects/does-hearing-help-seeing/", "summary": "Recent audio-video generative systems suggest that coupling modalities benefits not only audio-video synchrony but also the video modality itself. We pose a fundamental question: Does audio-video joint denoising training improve video generation, even when we only care about video quality? To study this, we introduce a parameter-efficient Audio-Video Full DiT (AVFullDiT) architecture that leverages pre-trained text-to-video (T2V) and text-to-audio (T2A) modules for joint denoising. We train (i) a T2AV model with AVFullDiT and (ii) a T2V-only counterpart under identical settings. Our results provide the first systematic evidence that audio-video joint denoising can deliver more than synchrony. We observe consistent improvements on challenging subsets featuring large and object contact motions.

However, executing agents at scale using high-capacity LLMs incurs high inference costs. We propose a simple method for reducing LLM agent inference costs without incurring the development friction costs associated with LLM fine-tuning (long training cycles, optimization hyperparameter tweaking loops) or manual prompt engineering (laborious trial and error). Most importantly, we introduce $\\textit{in-context distillation}$, which adapts the idea of knowledge distillation (training a low cost-student model to mimic a high-cost teacher) to an in-context learning setting. Our approach retrieves relevant teacher demonstrations at each agent step and provides them to the student as in-context examples, enabling the student to imitate teacher behavior on-the-fly. We combine in-context distillation with the established idea of $\\textit{self-consistency cascades}$ to know when the trust the student. This adaptive strategy realizes the cost benefits of model specialization while preserving the productivity of working with frozen models. On the multi-step embodied reasoning benchmark ALFWorld, our method matches teacher-level accuracy at $\\textbf{2.5$\\times$ lower cost}$, reducing per-episode costs from \\$0.059 to \\$0.024. The upfront demonstration cost amortizes after just 843 episodes, yielding cumulative savings exceeding \\$34,900 at deployment scale (1M episodes). On AppWorld, a complex agent benchmark requiring multi-step API workflows, we shift the Pareto frontier by achieving a $\\textbf{2$\\times$ cost reduction}$ at iso-accuracy.

However, when deployed in real life, agents often face sequential tasks, where each new sub-task follows the completion of the previous one, and certain sub-tasks may be infeasible, such as searching for a non-existent object. Compared with the single-task setting, the core challenge lies in reusing spatial knowledge accumulated from previous explorations to support subsequent reasoning and exploration. In this work, we investigate this underexplored yet practically significant embodied AI challenge. To evaluate this challenge, we introduce SEER-Bench, a new Sequential Embodied Exploration and Reasoning Benchmark encompassing encompassing two classic embodied tasks: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) and Embodied Multi-modal Navigation (EMN). Building on SEER-Bench, we propose 3DSPMR, a 3D SPatial Memory Reasoning approach that exploits relational, visual, and geometric cues from explored regions to augment Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for reasoning and exploration in sequential embodied tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explicitly incorporate geometric information into MLLM-based spatial understanding and reasoning.

Code available at: https://github.com/AlbMLpy/TN-FL-Model", "summary": "Many approximations were suggested to circumvent the cubic complexity of kernel-based algorithms, allowing their application to large-scale datasets. One strategy is to consider the primal formulation of the learning problem by mapping the data to a higher-dimensional space using tensor-product structured polynomial and Fourier features. The curse of dimensionality due to these tensor-product features was effectively solved by a tensor network reparameterization of the model parameters. However, another important aspect of model training - identifying optimal feature hyperparameters - has not been addressed and is typically handled using the standard cross-validation approach. In this paper, we introduce the Feature Learning (FL) model, which addresses this issue by representing tensor-product features as a learnable Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD).

Among various approaches, distribution matching (DM)-based methods have attracted attention for their high efficiency. However, they often overlook the evolution of feature representations during training, which limits the expressiveness of synthetic data and weakens downstream performance. To address this issue, we propose Trajectory Guided Dataset Distillation (TGDD), which reformulates distribution matching as a dynamic alignment process along the model's training trajectory. At each training stage, TGDD captures evolving semantics by aligning the feature distribution between the synthetic and original dataset. Meanwhile, it introduces a distribution constraint regularization to reduce class overlap. This design helps synthetic data preserve both semantic diversity and representativeness, improving performance in downstream tasks. Without additional optimization overhead, TGDD achieves a favorable balance between performance and efficiency.

Gaussian policies provide tractable likelihoods and smooth gradients, but their unimodal form limits expressiveness. Conversely, generative policies based on diffusion or flow matching can model rich multimodal behaviors; however, in online RL, they are frequently unstable due to intractable likelihoods and noisy gradients propagating through deep sampling chains. We address this tension with a key structural principle: decoupling optimization from generation. Building on this insight, we introduce GoRL (Generative Online Reinforcement Learning), a framework that optimizes a tractable latent policy while utilizing a conditional generative decoder to synthesize actions. A two-timescale update schedule enables the latent policy to learn stably while the decoder steadily increases expressiveness, without requiring tractable action likelihoods. Across a range of continuous-control tasks, GoRL consistently outperforms both Gaussian policies and recent generative-policy baselines. Notably, on the HopperStand task, it reaches a normalized return above 870, more than 3 times that of the strongest baseline.

This mismatch produces steep interfacial temperature gradients, making the transient thermal response highly sensitive to the interface. Conventional numerical solvers require excessive discretization to resolve these dynamics, while physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often exhibit unstable convergence and loss of physical consistency near the material interface. To address these challenges, we introduce HeatTransFormer, a physics-guided Transformer architecture for interface-dominated diffusion problems. The framework integrates physically informed spatiotemporal sampling, a Laplace-based activation emulating analytical diffusion solutions, and a mask-free attention mechanism supporting bidirectional spatiotemporal coupling. These components enable the model to resolve steep gradients, maintain physical consistency, and remain stable where PINNs typically fail. HeatTransFormer produces coherent temperature fields across the interface when applied to a finite layer and semi-infinite substrate configuration. Coupled with a physics-constrained inverse strategy, it further enables reliable identification of three unknown thermal properties simultaneously using only external measurements.

Recent multi-agent frameworks simulate Multidisciplinary Team (MDT) debates to mitigate single-model bias, but open-ended discussions amplify textual noise and computational cost while failing to anchor reasoning to visual evidence, the cornerstone of medical decision-making. We propose UCAgents, a hierarchical multi-agent framework enforcing unidirectional convergence through structured evidence auditing. Inspired by clinical workflows, UCAgents forbids position changes and limits agent interactions to targeted evidence verification, suppressing rhetorical drift while amplifying visual signal extraction. In UCAgents, a one-round inquiry discussion is introduced to uncover potential risks of visual-textual misalignment. This design jointly constrains visual ambiguity and textual noise, a dual-noise bottleneck that we formalize via information theory. Extensive experiments on four medical VQA benchmarks show UCAgents achieves superior accuracy (71.3% on PathVQA, +6.0% over state-of-the-art) with 87.7% lower token cost, the evaluation results further confirm that UCAgents strikes a balance between uncovering more visual evidence and avoiding confusing textual interference. These results demonstrate that UCAgents exhibits both diagnostic reliability and computational efficiency critical for real-world clinical deployment.

In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u673a\u5668\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ece\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u4f20\u9012\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94SVM\u6a21\u578b\u5c11100\u500d\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5efa\u6a21", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c2\u6570\u8fc7\u591a\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f20\u91cf\u6838\u673a\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5f20\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u5728\u539f\u59cb\u57df\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u5411\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u4f20\u9012\u77e5\u8bc6", "result": "\u5728\u8033\u540eEEG\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u60a3\u8005\u65e0\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u6bd4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94SVM\u5c11\u7ea6100\u500d", "conclusion": "Adapt-TKM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u5e94\u7528"}}

However, existing methods typically adopt standard decoders from language modeling, which rely on a causal attention mask. This design introduces two fundamental conflicts in 3D scene understanding: sequential bias among order-agnostic 3D objects and restricted object-instruction attention, hindering task-specific reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we propose 3D Spatial Language Instruction Mask (3D-SLIM), an effective masking strategy that replaces the causal mask with an adaptive attention mask tailored to the spatial structure of 3D scenes. Our 3D-SLIM introduces two key components: a Geometry-adaptive Mask that constrains attention based on spatial density rather than token order, and an Instruction-aware Mask that enables object tokens to directly access instruction context. This design allows the model to process objects based on their spatial relationships while being guided by the user's task. 3D-SLIM is simple, requires no architectural modifications, and adds no extra parameters, yet it yields substantial performance improvements across diverse 3D scene-language tasks.

To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp).

We present YingVideo-MV, the first cascaded framework for music-driven long-video generation. Our approach integrates audio semantic analysis, an interpretable shot planning module (MV-Director), temporal-aware diffusion Transformer architectures, and long-sequence consistency modeling to enable automatic synthesis of high-quality music performance videos from audio signals. We construct a large-scale Music-in-the-Wild Dataset by collecting web data to support the achievement of diverse, high-quality results. Observing that existing long-video generation methods lack explicit camera motion control, we introduce a camera adapter module that embeds camera poses into latent noise. To enhance continulity between clips during long-sequence inference, we further propose a time-aware dynamic window range strategy that adaptively adjust denoising ranges based on audio embedding. Comprehensive benchmark tests demonstrate that YingVideo-MV achieves outstanding performance in generating coherent and expressive music videos, and enables precise music-motion-camera synchronization.

Yet paradoxically, some of today's best generative models -- diffusion and flow-based models -- still require hundreds to thousands of neural function evaluations (NFEs) to compute a single likelihood. While recent distillation methods have successfully accelerated sampling to just a few steps, they achieve this at the cost of likelihood tractability: existing approaches either abandon likelihood computation entirely or still require expensive integration over full trajectories. We present fast flow joint distillation (F2D2), a framework that simultaneously reduces the number of NFEs required for both sampling and likelihood evaluation by two orders of magnitude. Our key insight is that in continuous normalizing flows, the coupled ODEs for sampling and likelihood are computed from a shared underlying velocity field, allowing us to jointly distill both the sampling trajectory and cumulative divergence using a single model. F2D2 is modular, compatible with existing flow-based few-step sampling models, and requires only an additional divergence prediction head. Experiments demonstrate F2D2's capability of achieving accurate log-likelihood with few-step evaluations while maintaining high sample quality, solving a long-standing computational bottleneck in flow-based generative models. As an application of our approach, we propose a lightweight self-guidance method that enables a 2-step MeanFlow model to outperform a 1024 step teacher model with only a single additional backward NFE.", "AI": {"tldr": "F2D2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6563\u5ea6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u597d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u5230\u6570\u5343\u6b21\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6765\u8ba1\u7b97\u5355\u4e2a\u4f3c\u7136\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5feb\u901f\u6d41\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\uff08F2D2\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u4e2d\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8026\u5408ODE\u5171\u4eab\u5e95\u5c42\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u84b8\u998f\u91c7\u6837\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u7d2f\u79ef\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6dfb\u52a0\u6563\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u5934\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eF2D2\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6b65\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u957f\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "F2D2\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\u8bc4\u4f30\u6240\u9700\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u51fd\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f2\u6b65MeanFlow\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u4e00\u6b21\u53cd\u5411NFE\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a1024\u6b65\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

We reveal both theoretical and practical problems associated with such deep-learning-based registration methods using GMMs, with a particular focus on the limitations of DeepGMR, a pioneering study in this line, to the partial-to-partial point set registration. Our primary goal is to uncover the causes behind such methods and propose a comprehensible solution for that. To address this, we introduce an attention-based reference point shifting (ARPS) layer, which robustly identifies a common reference point of two partial point sets, thereby acquiring transformation-invariant features. The ARPS layer employs a well-studied attention module to find a common reference point rather than the overlap region.

We present MedSeg-TTA, a comprehensive benchmark that examines twenty representative adaptation methods across seven imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, pathology, dermoscopy, OCT, and chest X-ray, under fully unified data preprocessing, backbone configuration, and test time protocols. The benchmark encompasses four significant adaptation paradigms: Input-level Transformation, Feature-level Alignment, Output-level Regularization, and Prior Estimation, enabling the first systematic cross-modality comparison of their reliability and applicability. The results show that no single paradigm performs best in all conditions. Input-level methods are more stable under mild appearance shifts. Feature-level and Output-level methods offer greater advantages in boundary-related metrics, whereas prior-based methods exhibit strong modality dependence. Several methods degrade significantly under large inter-center and inter-device shifts, which highlights the importance of principled method selection for clinical deployment.

This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines.

In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence.

In this paper, we present SkyMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model tailored for multimodal, multi-task RS interpretation. SkyMoE employs an adaptive router that generates task- and granularity-aware routing instructions, enabling specialized large language model experts to handle diverse sub-tasks. To further promote expert decoupling and granularity sensitivity, we introduce a context-disentangled augmentation strategy that creates contrastive pairs between local and global features, guiding experts toward level-specific representation learning.

In this paper, we introduce the first credal graph neural networks (CGNNs), which extend credal learning to the graph domain by training GNNs to output set-valued predictions in the form of credal sets. To account for the distinctive nature of message passing in GNNs, we develop a complementary approach to credal learning that leverages different aspects of layer-wise information propagation. We assess our approach on uncertainty quantification in node classification under out-of-distribution conditions. Our analysis highlights the critical role of the graph homophily assumption in shaping the effectiveness of uncertainty estimates.

This dissertation aims to investigate the core challenges of zero-shot AC/AS and presents principled solutions rooted in theory and algorithmic design.\n  We first formalize the problem of consistent anomalies, a failure mode in which recurring similar anomalies systematically bias distance-based methods. By analyzing the statistical and geometric behavior of patch representations from pre-trained Vision Transformers, we identify two key phenomena - similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout - that describe how relationships among normal patches change with and without consistent anomalies in settings characterized by highly similar objects.\n  We then introduce CoDeGraph, a graph-based framework for filtering consistent anomalies built on the similarity scaling and neighbor-burnout phenomena. Through multi-stage graph construction, community detection, and structured refinement, CoDeGraph effectively suppresses the influence of consistent anomalies.\n  Next, we extend this framework to 3D medical imaging by proposing a training-free, computationally efficient volumetric tokenization strategy for MRI data. This enables a genuinely zero-shot 3D anomaly detection pipeline and shows that volumetric anomaly segmentation is achievable without any 3D training samples.\n  Finally, we bridge batch-based and text-based zero-shot methods by demonstrating that CoDeGraph-derived pseudo-masks can supervise prompt-driven vision-language models.

We consider the minimisation of a mean squared error distortion, where a jammer attempts to disrupt the recovery of a Gaussian source encoded and transmitted over the adversarial channel. A straightforward consequence of existing theoretical results is the fact that the saddle point of a minimax game - involving such an encoder, its corresponding decoder, and an adversarial jammer - consists of diagonal Gaussian noise output by the jammer. We use this result as inspiration for a novel approach to distribution matching in the latent space, utilising jamming as an auxiliary objective to encourage the aggregated latent posterior to match a diagonal Gaussian distribution. Using this new technique, we achieve distribution matching comparable to standard variational autoencoders and to Wasserstein autoencoders. This approach can also be generalised to other latent distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e72\u6270\u6765\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u7834\u574f\u9ad8\u65af\u6e90\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u7684\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\uff0c\u978d\u70b9\u7531\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6784\u6210\u3002\u53d7\u6b64\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e72\u6270\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4fc3\u4f7f\u805a\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u540e\u9a8c\u5339\u914d\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u65e0\u7ebf\u5e72\u6270\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u7684\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u535a\u5f08\uff0c\u4f7f\u5e72\u6270\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u89d2\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cWasserstein\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3\u5176\u4ed6\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u624b\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing sparse-attention variants offer partial speedups, yet lack a systematic analysis of how global attention contributes to multi-view reasoning. In this paper, we first conduct an in-depth investigation of the global attention modules in VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ to better understand their roles. Our analysis reveals a clear division of roles in the alternating global-frame architecture: early global layers do not form meaningful correspondences, middle layers perform cross-view alignment, and last layers provide only minor refinements. Guided by these findings, we propose a training-free two-step acceleration scheme: (1) converting early global layers into frame attention, and (2) subsampling global attention by subsampling K/V over patch tokens with diagonal preservation and a mean-fill component. We instantiate this strategy on VGGT and $\u03c0^3$ and evaluate across standard pose and point-map benchmarks.

However, their memorization-generalization behavior remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit the flow matching (FM) objective and study its marginal velocity field, which admits a closed-form expression, allowing exact computation of the oracle FM target. Analyzing this oracle velocity field reveals that flow-based diffusion models inherently formulate a two-stage training target: an early stage guided by a mixture of data modes, and a later stage dominated by the nearest data sample. The two-stage objective leads to distinct learning behaviors: the early navigation stage generalizes across data modes to form global layouts, whereas the later refinement stage increasingly memorizes fine-grained details. Leveraging these insights, we explain the effectiveness of practical techniques such as timestep-shifted schedules, classifier-free guidance intervals, and latent space design choices.

While previous approaches have explored pedestrian generation for data augmentation, they often fail to ensure identity consistency and suffer from insufficient controllability, thereby limiting their effectiveness in dataset augmentation. To address this, We introduce OmniPerson, the first unified identity-preserving pedestrian generation pipeline for visible/infrared image/video ReID tasks. Our contributions are threefold: 1) We proposed OmniPerson, a unified generation model, offering holistic and fine-grained control over all key pedestrian attributes. Supporting RGB/IR modality image/video generation with any number of reference images, two kinds of person poses, and text. Also including RGB-to-IR transfer and image super-resolution abilities.2) We designed Multi-Refer Fuser for robust identity preservation with any number of reference images as input, making OmniPerson could distill a unified identity from a set of multi-view reference images, ensuring our generated pedestrians achieve high-fidelity pedestrian generation.3) We introduce PersonSyn, the first large-scale dataset for multi-reference, controllable pedestrian generation, and present its automated curation pipeline which transforms public, ID-only ReID benchmarks into a richly annotated resource with the dense, multi-modal supervision required for this task. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniPerson achieves SoTA in pedestrian generation, excelling in both visual fidelity and identity consistency. Furthermore, augmenting existing datasets with our generated data consistently improves the performance of ReID models.

Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off.

A popular approach to achieve robust representations is to use web-scale scientific data. However, current biomedical vision-language pretraining typically compresses rich scientific figures and text into coarse figure-level pairs, discarding the fine-grained correspondences that clinicians actually rely on when zooming into local structures. To tackle this issue, we introduce Panel2Patch, a novel data pipeline that mines hierarchical structure from existing biomedical scientific literature, i.e., multi-panel, marker-heavy figures and their surrounding text, and converts them into multi-granular supervision. Given scientific figures and captions, Panel2Patch parses layouts, panels, and visual markers, then constructs hierarchical aligned vision-language pairs at the figure, panel, and patch levels, preserving local semantics instead of treating each figure as a single data sample. Built on this hierarchical corpus, we develop a granularity-aware pretraining strategy that unifies heterogeneous objectives from coarse didactic descriptions to fine region-focused phrases.

It employs adversarial negative sampling alongside point-in-time subgraph training to learn representations that capture both the fine-grained semantics of evolving text and the time-sensitive structure of the graph. We evaluated extensively on interaction data from Upwork, a leading labor marketplace, at large scale, and discuss our approach towards low-latency inference suitable for real-time use. In our experiments, GraphMatch outperforms language-only and graph-only baselines on matching tasks while being efficient at runtime.

Recent approaches have leveraged motion graphs to harness the potential of existing video data. To retrieve an appropriate trajectory from the graph, previous methods either utilize the distance between features extracted from the input audio and those associated with the motions in the graph or embed both the input audio and motion into a shared feature space. However, these techniques may not be optimal due to the many-to-many mapping nature between audio and gestures, which cannot be adequately addressed by one-to-one mapping. To alleviate this limitation, we propose a novel framework that initially employs a diffusion model to generate gesture motions. The diffusion model implicitly learns the joint distribution of audio and motion, enabling the generation of contextually appropriate gestures from input audio sequences. Furthermore, our method extracts both low-level and high-level features from the input audio to enrich the training process of the diffusion model. Subsequently, a meticulously designed motion-based retrieval algorithm is applied to identify the most suitable path within the graph by assessing both global and local similarities in motion. Given that not all nodes in the retrieved path are sequentially continuous, the final step involves seamlessly stitching together these segments to produce a coherent video output. Experimental results substantiate the efficacy of our proposed method, demonstrating a significant improvement over prior approaches in terms of synchronization accuracy and naturalness of generated gestures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u624b\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u56fe\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7279\u5f81\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u6620\u5c04\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u624b\u52bf\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u5bf9\u4e00\u6620\u5c04\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u4e0d\u591f\u81ea\u7136\u548c\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u9690\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u97f3\u9891\u4e0e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2. \u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u97f3\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4f4e\u5c42\u7ea7\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u4e30\u5bcc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u5c40\u90e8\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f18\u8def\u5f84\uff1b4. \u5bf9\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u7f1d\u62fc\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u624b\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u68c0\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bed\u97f3\u9a71\u52a8\u624b\u52bf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u5bf9\u591a\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Previous methods on this issue often require a sufficiently large number of normal neighboring clients or prior knowledge of reliable clients, which reduces the practical applicability of DFL. To address these limitations, we develop here a novel adaptive DFL (aDFL) approach for robust estimation. The key idea is to adaptively adjust the learning rates of clients. By assigning smaller rates to suspicious clients and larger rates to normal clients, aDFL mitigates the negative impact of abnormal clients on the global model in a fully adaptive way. Our theory does not put any stringent conditions on neighboring nodes and requires no prior knowledge. A rigorous convergence analysis is provided to guarantee the oracle property of aDFL.

However, fine appearance details need to be represented as a large number of small Gaussian primitives, which can be wasteful when geometry and appearance exhibit different frequency characteristics.\n  Inspired by the long tradition of texture mapping, we propose to use texture to represent detailed appearance where possible. Our main focus is to incorporate per-primitive texture maps that adapt to the scene in a principled manner during Gaussian Splatting optimization. We do this by proposing a new appearance representation for 2D Gaussian primitives with textures where the size of a texel is bounded by the image sampling frequency and adapted to the content of the input images. We achieve this by adaptively upscaling or downscaling the texture resolution during optimization. In addition, our approach enables control of the number of primitives during optimization based on texture resolution. We show that our approach performs favorably in image quality and total number of parameters used compared to alternative solutions for textured Gaussian primitives.

A possible approach to mitigate these challenges is the development of multi-fidelity emulators, leveraging potentially biased, inexpensive low-fidelity information while correcting and refining predictions using scarce, accurate high-fidelity data. This study investigates the performance of multi-fidelity neural emulators, neural networks designed to learn the input-to-output mapping by integrating limited high-fidelity data with abundant low-fidelity model solutions. We investigate the performance of such emulators for low and high-dimensional functions, with oscillatory character, in the presence of discontinuities, for collections of models with equal and dissimilar parametrization, and for a possibly large number of potentially corrupted low-fidelity sources. In doing so, we consider a large number of architectural, hyperparameter, and dataset configurations including networks with a different amount of spectral bias (Multi-Layered Perceptron, Siren and Kolmogorov Arnold Network), various mechanisms for coordinate encoding, exact or learnable low-fidelity information, and for varying training dataset size.

To evaluate these video generation models, existing benchmarks primarily focus on factors related to visual perception and understanding, like visual aesthetics, instruction adherence, and temporal coherence. However, the rule-based reasoning capabilities of video generation models remain largely unexplored. Although recent studies have carried out preliminary explorations into whether video models can serve as zero-shot learners, they still lack a fine-grained decomposition of reasoning capabilities and a comprehensive evaluation protocol. To address this gap, we introduce RULER-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning ability of video generation models from the perspective of cognitive rules. Built upon two fundamental paradigms: text-to-video and image-to-video, RULER-Bench covers 40 representative tasks spanning six rule categories with 622 high-quality annotated instances. For the evaluation of each generated video, we construct a checklist covering four metrics and leverage GPT-o3 to assign scores to each question, achieving 85% alignment with human judgements. Extensive experiments show that the state-of-the-art model achieves only 48.87% on the rule coherence metric, highlighting significant room for improvement in the reasoning capability of next-level video models.

We propose Optimal Rollout Allocation for Test-time Policy Optimization (OptPO), a principled framework that adaptively allocates inference budgets. By formulating the voting process as a Bayesian sequential probability ratio test, OptPO dynamically halts sampling once the posterior confidence in a consensus answer exceeds a specified threshold. Crucially, it utilizes the retained rollouts for on-policy updates, seamlessly integrating with algorithms like PPO or GRPO without requiring ground-truth labels. Across diverse reasoning benchmarks, OptPO significantly reduces rollout overhead compared to fixed-sample baselines while preserving or improving accuracy. By unifying statistically optimal stopping with test-time learning, OptPO offers a computationally efficient paradigm for test-time adaptation.

To bridge this gap, we introduce PPTBench, a comprehensive multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs on PowerPoint-related tasks. Leveraging a diverse source of 958 PPTX files, PPTBench evaluates models across four categories with 4,439 samples, including Detection, Understanding, Modification, and Generation. Our experiments reveal a substantial gap between semantic understanding and visual-layout reasoning in current MLLMs: models can interpret slide content but fail to produce coherent spatial arrangements. Ablation and further analysis show that current MLLMs struggle to combine visual cues with JSON-based layout structures and fail to integrate visual information into their API planning ability. And case studies visually expose systematic layout errors such as misalignment and element overlap. These findings provides a new perspective on evaluating VLLMs in PPT scenarios, highlighting challenges and directions for future research on visual-structural reasoning and coherent slide generation.

While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods.

To address this challenge, we explore the potential of foundation models by proposing a novel pretraining strategy that leverages large-scale simulated datasets to learn robust spatial-spectral priors. Specifically, our approach first constructs diverse simulated datasets by applying various degradation operations (blur, noise, downsampling) and augmentations (bands generation, channel shuffling, high-pass filtering, color jittering, etc.) to natural images from ImageNet and remote sensing images from SkyScript. We then pretrain fusion models on these simulated data to learn generalizable spatial-spectral representations. The pretrained models are subsequently evaluated on six datasets (WorldView-2/3/4, IKONOS, QuickBird, GaoFen-2) using zero-shot and one-shot paradigms, with both full- and freeze-tuning approaches for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on different network architectures including convolutional neural networks, Transformer, and Mamba demonstrate that our pretraining strategy significantly improves generalization performance across different satellite sensors and imaging conditions for various fusion models. The pretrained models achieve superior results in zero-shot scenarios and show remarkable adaptation capability with minimal real data in one-shot settings.

We formulate this testing problem by introducing a notion of separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of $\\mathcal{T}_F$ models. We then derive upper and lower bounds on the critical threshold for testing that depend on the topology of the observation graph. For the special case of complete observation graphs, this threshold scales as $\u0398((nk)^{-1/2})$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $k$ is the number of comparisons per pair. Furthermore, we propose a hypothesis test based on our separation distance, construct confidence intervals, establish time-uniform bounds on the probabilities of type I and II errors using reverse martingale techniques, and derive minimax lower bounds using information-theoretic methods.

To appear in KDD'26 Datasets", "summary": "We consider analyzing traffic accident patterns using both road network data and satellite images aligned to road graph nodes. Previous work for predicting accident occurrences relies primarily on road network structural features while overlooking physical and environmental information from the road surface and its surroundings. In this work, we construct a large multimodal dataset across six U.S. states, containing nine million traffic accident records from official sources, and one million high-resolution satellite images for each node of the road network. Additionally, every node is annotated with features such as the region's weather statistics and road type (e.g., residential vs. motorway), and each edge is annotated with traffic volume information (i.e., Average Annual Daily Traffic). Utilizing this dataset, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of multimodal learning methods that integrate both visual and network embeddings. Our findings show that integrating both data modalities improves prediction accuracy, achieving an average AUROC of $90.1\\%$, which is a $3.7\\%$ gain over graph neural network models that only utilize graph structures. With the improved embeddings, we conduct a causal analysis based on a matching estimator to estimate the key contributing factors influencing traffic accidents. We find that accident rates rise by $24\\%$ under higher precipitation, by $22\\%$ on higher-speed roads such as motorways, and by $29\\%$ due to seasonal patterns, after adjusting for other confounding factors. Ablation studies confirm that satellite imagery features are essential for achieving accurate prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u6570\u636e\u548c\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u964d\u6c34\u3001\u9053\u8def\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u9053\u8def\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u53ca\u5176\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6765\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b600\u4e07\u6761\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u8bb0\u5f55\u548c100\u4e07\u5f20\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7f51\u7edc\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u5230AUROC 90.1%\uff0c\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53473.7%\u3002\u56e0\u679c\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u964d\u6c34\u589e\u52a0\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u4e0a\u534724%\uff0c\u9ad8\u901f\u516c\u8def\u7b49\u9ad8\u901f\u9053\u8def\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u4e0a\u534722%\uff0c\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e8b\u6545\u7387\u4e0a\u534729%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e8b\u6545\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002"}}

Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization.

The Gaussian process model is a powerful tool commonly used in nonlinear regression applications. Standard regression modeling assumes random samples and an independently, identically distributed noise. Various fast approximations that speed up Gaussian process regression work under this standard setting. But for autocorrelated data, failing to account for autocorrelation leads to a phenomenon known as temporal overfitting that deteriorates model performance on new test instances. To handle autocorrelated data, existing fast Gaussian process approximations have to be modified; one such approach is to segment the originally correlated data points into blocks in which the blocked data are de-correlated. This work explains how to make some of the existing Gaussian process approximations work with blocked data. Numerical experiments across diverse application datasets demonstrate that the proposed approaches can remarkably accelerate computation for Gaussian process regression on autocorrelated data without compromising model prediction performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u8ba1\u7b97\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u6807\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u6570\u636e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65b0\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b9e\u4f8b\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u624d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u539f\u59cb\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5206\u6bb5\u6210\u5757\uff0c\u4f7f\u5757\u5185\u6570\u636e\u53bb\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u7136\u540e\u8c03\u6574\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5757\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5757\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Conversely, OCR-based systems extract structured text with bounding box coordinates but lack semantic grounding for relevance assessment. We propose a hybrid architecture that unifies these paradigms: using ColPali's patch-level similarity scores as spatial relevance filters over OCR-extracted regions. We formalize the coordinate mapping between vision transformer patch grids and OCR bounding boxes, introduce intersection metrics for relevance propagation, and establish theoretical bounds on retrieval precision.

To address this issue, we develop a lightweight diffusion method, PGP-DiffSR, by removing redundant information from diffusion models under the guidance of the phase information of inputs for efficient image super-resolution. We first identify the intra-block redundancy within the diffusion backbone and propose a progressive pruning approach that removes redundant blocks while reserving restoration capability. We note that the phase information of the restored images produced by the pruned diffusion model is not well estimated. To solve this problem, we propose a phase-exchange adapter module that explores the phase information of the inputs to guide the pruned diffusion model for better restoration performance. We formulate the progressive pruning approach and the phase-exchange adapter module into a unified model.

However, existing benchmarks focus on either training/fine-tuning or performance of inference and provide little support for power consumption measurement and analysis of inference. We introduce TokenPowerBench, the first lightweight and extensible benchmark designed for LLM-inference power consumption studies. The benchmark combines (i) a declarative configuration interface covering model choice, prompt set, and inference engine, (ii) a measurement layer that captures GPU-, node-, and system-level power without specialized power meters, and (iii) a phase-aligned metrics pipeline that attributes energy to the prefill and decode stages of every request. These elements make it straight-forward to explore the power consumed by an LLM inference run; furthermore, by varying batch size, context length, parallelism strategy and quantization, users can quickly assess how each setting affects joules per token and other energy-efficiency metrics.

However, existing approaches typically process foreground and background regions indiscriminately, often resulting in background interference and suboptimal instance discovery performance on real-world data. To address this limitation, we propose Foreground-Aware Slot Attention (FASA), a two-stage framework that explicitly separates foreground from background to enable precise object discovery. In the first stage, FASA performs a coarse scene decomposition to distinguish foreground from background regions through a dual-slot competition mechanism. These slots are initialized via a clustering-based strategy, yielding well-structured representations of salient regions. In the second stage, we introduce a masked slot attention mechanism where the first slot captures the background while the remaining slots compete to represent individual foreground objects. To further address over-segmentation of foreground objects, we incorporate pseudo-mask guidance derived from a patch affinity graph constructed with self-supervised image features to guide the learning of foreground slots. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FASA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of explicit foreground modeling and pseudo-mask guidance for robust scene decomposition and object-coherent representation.

In this paper, we have developed a system that can detect the proper maintenance of that distance and people are properly using masks or not. We have used the customized attention-inceptionv3 model in this system for the identification of those two components. We have used two different datasets along with 10,800 images including both with and without Face Mask images. The training accuracy has been achieved 98% and validation accuracy 99.5%. The system can conduct a precision value of around 98.2% and the frame rate per second (FPS) was 25.0.

However, the scarcity and limited diversity of anomaly data severely constrain model generalization in open-world environments. Existing approaches mitigate this issue through synthetic data generation, either by copy-pasting external objects into driving scenes or by leveraging text-to-image diffusion models to inpaint anomalous regions. While these methods improve anomaly diversity, they often lack contextual coherence and physical realism, resulting in domain gaps between synthetic and real data. In this paper, we present ClimaDrive, a semantics-guided image-to-image framework for synthesizing semantically coherent, weather-diverse, and physically plausible OoD driving data. ClimaDrive unifies structure-guided multi-weather generation with prompt-driven anomaly inpainting, enabling the creation of visually realistic training data. Based on this framework, we construct ClimaOoD, a large-scale benchmark spanning six representative driving scenarios under both clear and adverse weather conditions. Extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art methods show that training with ClimaOoD leads to robust improvements in anomaly segmentation.

However, the traditional satellite-centric paradigm limits robustness when high-resolution or up-to-date satellite imagery is unavailable. It further underexploits complementary cues across views (e.g., drone, satellite, and street) and modalities (e.g., language and image). To address these challenges, we propose GeoBridge, a foundation model that performs bidirectional matching across views and supports language-to-image retrieval. Going beyond traditional satellite-centric formulations, GeoBridge builds on a novel semantic-anchor mechanism that bridges multi-view features through textual descriptions for robust, flexible localization. In support of this task, we construct GeoLoc, the first large-scale, cross-modal, and multi-view aligned dataset comprising over 50,000 pairs of drone, street-view panorama, and satellite images as well as their textual descriptions, collected from 36 countries, ensuring both geographic and semantic alignment. We performed broad evaluations across multiple tasks.

Many pruning methods rely solely on token importance and thus overlook inter-token redundancy, retaining numerous duplicated tokens and wasting capacity. Although some redundancy-aware approaches have been proposed, they often ignore the spatial relationships among visual tokens. This can lead to overly sparse selections of retained tokens that fail to adequately cover the regions of target objects. To address these limitations, we propose VLM-Pruner, a training-free token pruning algorithm that explicitly balances redundancy and spatial sparsity. We introduce a centrifugal token pruning paradigm that enables near-to-far selection while prioritizing the preservation of fine-grained object details. Moreover, we design a Buffering for Spatial Sparsity (BSS) criterion that defers the selection of spatially distant tokens.

The evaluation comprised overlap measures applied to the 71 VIBESegmentator masks: 1) Dice scores, and 2) voxel-wise label error frequency. Additionally, voxel-wise correlation between age and each of fat content and tissue volume was studied to exemplify the usefulness for medical research.\n  The proposed method exhibited a mean dice score of 0.77 / 0.75 across the cohort and the 71 masks for males/females, respectively. When compared to the intensity-only registration, the mean values were 6 percentage points (pp) higher for both sexes, and the label error frequency was decreased in most tissue regions. These differences were 9pp / 8pp against uniGradICON and 12pp / 13pp against MIRTK.

However, transferring such capabilities to remote sensing imagery remains challenging, as targets are often extremely small within kilometer-scale scenes, and queries typically involve intricate geospatial relations such as relative positions, spatial hierarchies, or contextual dependencies across distant objects. To address these challenges, we propose GeoViS, a Geospatially Rewarded Visual Search framework that reformulates remote sensing visual grounding as a progressive search-and-reasoning process. Rather than directly predicting the target location in a single step, GeoViS actively explores the global image through a tree-structured sequence of visual cues, integrating multimodal perception, spatial reasoning, and reward-guided exploration to refine geospatial hypotheses iteratively. This design enables the model to detect subtle small-scale targets while maintaining holistic scene awareness.

Project page: https://tkhkaeio.github.io/projects/25-dfmamba/index.html", "summary": "Modeling daily hand interactions often struggles with severe occlusions, such as when two hands overlap, which highlights the need for robust feature learning in 3D hand pose estimation (HPE). To handle such occluded hand images, it is vital to effectively learn the relationship between local image features (e.g., for occluded joints) and global context (e.g., cues from inter-joints, inter-hands, or the scene). However, most current 3D HPE methods still rely on ResNet for feature extraction, and such CNN's inductive bias may not be optimal for 3D HPE due to its limited capability to model the global context. To address this limitation, we propose an effective and efficient framework for visual feature extraction in 3D HPE using recent state space modeling (i.e., Mamba), dubbed Deformable Mamba (DF-Mamba). DF-Mamba is designed to capture global context cues beyond standard convolution through Mamba's selective state modeling and the proposed deformable state scanning. Specifically, for local features after convolution, our deformable scanning aggregates these features within an image while selectively preserving useful cues that represent the global context.

Accurate detection of methane emissions is the key to taking timely action and minimizing their impact on climate change. We present AttMetNet, a novel attention-enhanced deep learning framework for methane plume detection with Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The major challenge in developing a methane detection model is to accurately identify methane plumes from Sentinel-2's B11 and B12 bands while suppressing false positives caused by background variability and diverse land cover types. Traditional detection methods typically depend on the differences or ratios between these bands when comparing the scenes with and without plumes. However, these methods often require verification by a domain expert because they generate numerous false positives. Recent deep learning methods make some improvements using CNN-based architectures, but lack mechanisms to prioritize methane-specific features. AttMetNet introduces a methane-aware architecture that fuses the Normalized Difference Methane Index (NDMI) with an attention-enhanced U-Net. By jointly exploiting NDMI's plume-sensitive cues and attention-driven feature selection, AttMetNet selectively amplifies methane absorption features while suppressing background noise. This integration establishes a first-of-its-kind architecture tailored for robust methane plume detection in real satellite imagery.

Accepted to AAAI-26 (Main Technical Track)", "summary": "Electrocautery or lasers will inevitably generate surgical smoke, which hinders the visual guidance of laparoscopic videos for surgical procedures. The surgical smoke can be classified into different types based on its motion patterns, leading to distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics across smoky laparoscopic videos. However, existing desmoking methods fail to account for such smoke-type-specific distinctions. Therefore, we propose the first Smoke-Type-Aware Laparoscopic Video Desmoking Network (STANet) by introducing two smoke types: Diffusion Smoke and Ambient Smoke. Specifically, a smoke mask segmentation sub-network is designed to jointly conduct smoke mask and smoke type predictions based on the attention-weighted mask aggregation, while a smokeless video reconstruction sub-network is proposed to perform specially desmoking on smoky features guided by two types of smoke mask. To address the entanglement challenges of two smoke types, we further embed a coarse-to-fine disentanglement module into the mask segmentation sub-network, which yields more accurate disentangled masks through the smoke-type-aware cross attention between non-entangled and entangled regions. In addition, we also construct the first large-scale synthetic video desmoking dataset with smoke type annotations.

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets.

Existing data construction methods face a scale-quality trade-off: human annotations are high-quality but not scalable, while automated pipelines suffer from error propagation and noise. To address this, we introduce a lightweight data pipeline that replaces multi-toolchains with an end-to-end model and a unified post-verification stage. For scalable quality control, we train a 7B dual-task expert model, \\textbf{Qwen-Verify}, for efficient failure detection and instruction recaptioning. This pipeline yields \\textbf{UnicEdit-10M}, a 10M-scale dataset spanning diverse basic and complex editing tasks. We also propose \\textbf{UnicBench}, a general benchmark that extends beyond basic edits to explicitly assess spatial and knowledge-driven reasoning. To enable fine-grained diagnosis, we introduce novel metrics, including \\textit{Non-edit Consistency} and \\textit{Reasoning Accuracy}.

The core of this task lies in understanding the multi-modal composed query and achieving accurate composed feature learning. Within multi-modal queries, the video modality typically carries richer semantic content compared to the textual modality. However, previous works have largely overlooked the disparity in information density between these two modalities. This limitation can lead to two critical issues: 1) modification subject referring ambiguity and 2) limited detailed semantic focus, both of which degrade the performance of CVR models. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel CVR framework, namely the Hierarchical Uncertainty-aware Disambiguation network (HUD). HUD is the first framework that leverages the disparity in information density between video and text to enhance multi-modal query understanding. It comprises three key components: (a) Holistic Pronoun Disambiguation, (b) Atomistic Uncertainty Modeling, and (c) Holistic-to-Atomistic Alignment. By exploiting overlapping semantics through holistic cross-modal interaction and fine-grained semantic alignment via atomistic-level cross-modal interaction, HUD enables effective object disambiguation and enhances the focus on detailed semantics, thereby achieving precise composed feature learning. Moreover, our proposed HUD is also applicable to the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) task and achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets for both CVR and CIR tasks.

In this paper, we focus on shared world modeling, where a model generates multiple videos from a set of input images, each representing the same underlying world in different camera poses. We propose IC-World, a novel generation framework, enabling parallel generation for all input images via activating the inherent in-context generation capability of large video models.

The robustness and fairness of current detectors in this regime remain unclear, especially for under-represented populations. We present what we believe is the first systematic study of IP-AIGC detection for Indian and South-Asian faces, quantifying cross-generator generalization and intra-population performance. We assemble Indian-focused training splits from FairFD and HAV-DF, and construct two held-out IP-AIGC test sets (HIDF-img-ip-genai and HIDF-vid-ip-genai) using commercial web-UI generators (Gemini and ChatGPT) with identity-preserving prompts. We evaluate two state-of-the-art detectors (AIDE and Effort) under pretrained (PT) and fine-tuned (FT) regimes and report AUC, AP, EER, and accuracy. Fine-tuning yields strong in-domain gains (for example, Effort AUC 0.739 to 0.944 on HAV-DF-test; AIDE EER 0.484 to 0.259), but consistently degrades performance on held-out IP-AIGC for Indian cohorts (for example, AIDE AUC 0.923 to 0.563 on HIDF-img-ip-genai; Effort 0.740 to 0.533), which indicates overfitting to training-generator cues. On non-IP HIDF images, PT performance remains high, which suggests a specific brittleness to identity-preserving edits rather than a generic distribution shift.

To answer this, we trained a diverse zoo of 36 models, including CNNs and ViTs, and conducted comprehensive transferability experiments. Our results reveal a clear paradox: adversarially trained (AT) models produce perturbations that transfer more effectively than those from standard models, which introduce a new ecosystem risk.

Yet existing solutions generally collapse these factors into simplified reasoning with latent embeddings, rendering the reasoning chain opaque and essentially intractable. We therefore adopt an explicit decomposition perspective and introduce ReVSeg, which executes reasoning as sequential decisions in the native interface of pretrained vision language models (VLMs). Rather than folding all reasoning into a single-step prediction, ReVSeg executes three explicit operations -- semantics interpretation, temporal evidence selection, and spatial grounding -- aligning pretrained capabilities. We further employ reinforcement learning to optimize the multi-step reasoning chain, enabling the model to self-refine its decision quality from outcome-driven signals. Experimental results demonstrate that ReVSeg attains state-of-the-art performances on standard video object segmentation benchmarks and yields interpretable reasoning trajectories.

While conventional methods rely on extracting and aggregating temporal information from videos, as humans we can often predict upcoming actions by observing a single moment from a scene, when given sufficient context. Can a model achieve this competence? The short answer is yes, although its effectiveness depends on the complexity of the task. In this work, we investigate to what extent video aggregation can be replaced with alternative modalities. To this end, based on recent advances in visual feature extraction and language-based reasoning, we introduce AAG, a method for Action Anticipation at a Glimpse. AAG combines RGB features with depth cues from a single frame for enhanced spatial reasoning, and incorporates prior action information to provide long-term context. This context is obtained either through textual summaries from Vision-Language Models, or from predictions generated by a single-frame action recognizer.

In this work, we introduce an online RL post-training framework that optimizes a pretrained video generator for precise camera control. To make RL effective in this setting, we design a verifiable geometry reward that delivers dense segment-level feedback to guide model optimization. Specifically, we estimate the 3D camera trajectories for both generated and reference videos, divide each trajectory into short segments, and compute segment-wise relative poses.

It achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks at low cost, effectively enhancing the foundational capabilities of MLLMs and the generalization ability. Focusing on data construction, supervised fine-tuning strategies, and multimodal reinforcement learning methods, this work proposes three key innovations: (1) An information density-based data generation scheme, integrated with a dual-dimensional tree-structured label system, enabling automated generation of high-quality cross-domain data. (2) A collaborative curriculum supervised fine-tuning approach that balances the injection of domain-specific knowledge with the preservation of general capabilities. (3) A hybrid reinforcement learning paradigm that enhances reasoning ability while simultaneously addressing multi-objective optimization such as diversity exploration, maintenance of multimodal perception, and response conciseness. Moreover, we implement a series of infrastructure optimizations, such as 5D parallel training, operator optimization, and inference quantization to enhance training and inference efficiency while reducing the cost of domain adaptation. Experimental results demonstrate that the MindGPT-4ov model outperforms state-of-the-art models on benchmarks such as MMBench, MMStar, MathVision, and MathVista. In addition, MindGPT-4ov also demonstrates superior user experience in vertical domain tasks, enabling a seamless transition from academic research to industrial deployment.

Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u5e94\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u901f\u5ea6\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u667a\u80fd\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5747\u5300\u51cf\u5c11\u6b65\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u79c0\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u51cf\u5c11\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff1aSlow-LoRA\u5904\u7406\u65e9\u671f\u8bed\u4e49\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5c0f\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0cFast-LoRA\u5904\u7406\u540e\u671f\u5197\u4f59\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5927\u52a0\u901f\uff09\u3002\u4ec5\u9700\u4e3a\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\u914d\u5907\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u57fa\u6a21\u578b5\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002LoRA\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ec5\u97001\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u5728\u5355V100\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec31\u5c0f\u65f6\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f4d\u611f\u77e5\u7684LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent study address this issue by dividing the image into smaller crops and computing the semantic similarity between each crop and a query using a pretrained retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) model. The most relevant crops are then selected to localize the target object and suppress irrelevant information. However, such crop-based processing can fragment complete objects across multiple crops, thereby disrupting the computation of semantic similarity. In our experiments, we find that image crops of objects with different sizes are better handled at different resolutions. Based on this observation, we propose Multi-resolution Retrieval-Detection (MRD), a training-free framework for high-resolution image understanding. To address the issue of semantic similarity bias caused by objects being split across different image crops, we propose a multi-resolution semantic fusion method, which integrates semantic similarity maps obtained at different resolutions to produce more accurate semantic information and preserve the integrity of target objects.

We first analyze the factors that limit diversity in bitwise AR models and identify two key issues: (1) the binary classification nature of bitwise modeling, which restricts the prediction space, and (2) the overly sharp logits distribution, which causes sampling collapse and reduces diversity. Building on these insights, we propose DiverseAR, a principled and effective method that enhances image diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Specifically, we introduce an adaptive logits distribution scaling mechanism that dynamically adjusts the sharpness of the binary output distribution during sampling, resulting in smoother predictions and greater diversity. To mitigate potential fidelity loss caused by distribution smoothing, we further develop an energy-based generation path search algorithm that avoids sampling low-confidence tokens, thereby preserving high visual quality.

However, existing video benchmarks are physical commonsense-based, offering limited insight into video models' scientific reasoning capability. We introduce VideoScience-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate undergraduate-level scientific understanding in video models. Each prompt encodes a composite scientific scenario that requires understanding and reasoning across multiple scientific concepts to generate the correct phenomenon. The benchmark comprises 200 carefully curated prompts spanning 14 topics and 103 concepts in physics and chemistry. We conduct expert-annotated evaluations across seven state-of-the-art video models in T2V and I2V settings along five dimensions: Prompt Consistency, Phenomenon Congruency, Correct Dynamism, Immutability, and Spatio-Temporal Continuity. Using a VLM-as-a-Judge to assess video generations, we observe strong correlation with human assessments. To the best of our knowledge, VideoScience-Bench is the first benchmark to evaluate video models not only as generators but also as reasoners, requiring their generations to demonstrate scientific understanding consistent with expected physical and chemical phenomena.

Experimental results on the MMSafetyBench-tiny dataset show that CIA achieves high toxicity scores of 4.73 and 4.83 against the GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-VL-72B models, respectively, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) reaching 86.31\\% and 91.07\\%.

Existing solutions often rely on human intervention or underutilize the agent's ability to autonomously mitigate hallucination. To address these limitations, we draw inspiration from how humans make reliable decisions in the real world. They begin with introspective reasoning to reduce uncertainty and form an initial judgment, then rely on external verification from diverse perspectives to reach a final decision. Motivated by this cognitive paradigm, we propose InEx, a training-free, multi-agent framework designed to autonomously mitigate hallucination. InEx introduces internal introspective reasoning, guided by entropy-based uncertainty estimation, to improve the reliability of the decision agent's reasoning process. The agent first generates a response, which is then iteratively verified and refined through external cross-modal multi-agent collaboration with the editing agent and self-reflection agents, further enhancing reliability and mitigating hallucination. Extensive experiments show that InEx consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving 4%-27% gains on general and hallucination benchmarks, and demonstrating strong robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "InEx\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u601d\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f13\u89e3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u6216\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81ea\u4e3b\u7f13\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u5185\u90e8\u53cd\u601d\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cInEx\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53474%-27%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "InEx\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing datasets are often derived from limited simulators or utilize traditional Structurefrom-Motion for up-to-scale annotation and offer limited descriptive captioning, which restricts the capacity of foundation models to accurately interpret real-world dynamics from monocular videos, commonly sourced from the internet. To bridge these gaps, we introduce DynamicVerse, a physical-scale, multimodal 4D world modeling framework for dynamic real-world video. We employ large vision, geometric, and multimodal models to interpret metric-scale static geometry, real-world dynamic motion, instance-level masks, and holistic descriptive captions.

We revisit this problem from a feedforward perspective and introduce \\textbf{Driving Gaussian Grounded Transformer (DGGT)}, a unified framework for pose-free dynamic scene reconstruction. We note that the existing formulations, treating camera pose as a required input, limit flexibility and scalability. Instead, we reformulate pose as an output of the model, enabling reconstruction directly from sparse, unposed images and supporting an arbitrary number of views for long sequences. Our approach jointly predicts per-frame 3D Gaussian maps and camera parameters, disentangles dynamics with a lightweight dynamic head, and preserves temporal consistency with a lifespan head that modulates visibility over time. A diffusion-based rendering refinement further reduces motion/interpolation artifacts and improves novel-view quality under sparse inputs. The result is a single-pass, pose-free algorithm that achieves state-of-the-art performance and speed.

The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sync-LoRA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u8fc7\u6ee4\u8bad\u7ec3LoRA\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5e27\u7ea7\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8096\u50cf\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u8981\u7075\u6d3b\u800c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5404\u79cd\u4fee\u6539\uff08\u5982\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5173\u952e\u96be\u70b9\u5728\u4e8e\u4fdd\u6301\u4e3b\u4f53\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7f16\u8f91\u5e27\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6e90\u5e27\u7cbe\u786e\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e27\u5b9a\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u5185\u5bb9\u5e76\u4f20\u64ad\u5230\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u4e8e\u540c\u6b65\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LoRA\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u63cf\u7ed8\u76f8\u540c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f46\u5916\u89c2\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u9ad8\u5ea6\u7cbe\u9009\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u4eba\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0cSync-LoRA\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u7a33\u5065\u5904\u7406\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u786e\u8fd0\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

This problem is amplified when the network inputs contain time-varying corruptions. In this work, we introduce a general approach for adapting frame-based models for stable and robust inference on video. We describe a class of stability adapters that can be inserted into virtually any architecture and a resource-efficient training process that can be performed with a frozen base network. We introduce a unified conceptual framework for describing temporal stability and corruption robustness, centered on a proposed accuracy-stability-robustness loss.

Despite recent progress, directly generating B-Reps end-to-end with precise geometry and watertight topology remains a challenge. This paper presents AutoBrep, a novel Transformer model that autoregressively generates B-Reps with high quality and validity. AutoBrep employs a unified tokenization scheme that encodes both geometric and topological characteristics of a B-Rep model as a sequence of discrete tokens. Geometric primitives (i.e., surfaces and curves) are encoded as latent geometry tokens, and their structural relationships are defined as special topological reference tokens. Sequence order in AutoBrep naturally follows a breadth first traversal of the B-Rep face adjacency graph. At inference time, neighboring faces and edges along with their topological structure are progressively generated. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantages of our unified representation when coupled with next-token prediction for B-Rep generation. AutoBrep outperforms baselines with better quality and watertightness. It is also highly scalable to complex solids with good fidelity and inference speed. We further show that autocompleting B-Reps is natively supported through our unified tokenization, enabling user-controllable CAD generation with minimal changes.

Recent methods accelerate MRI by under-sampling $k$-space and reconstructing the resulting images using deep learning. Unrolled networks have been widely used for the reconstruction task due to their efficiency, but suffer from unstable evolving caused by freely-learnable parameters in intermediate steps. In contrast, diffusion models based on stochastic differential equations offer theoretical stability in both medical and natural image tasks but are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce flow ODEs to MRI reconstruction by theoretically proving that unrolled networks are discrete implementations of conditional probability flow ODEs. This connection provides explicit formulations for parameters and clarifies how intermediate states should evolve. Building on this insight, we propose Flow-Aligned Training (FLAT), which derives unrolled parameters from the ODE discretization and aligns intermediate reconstructions with the ideal ODE trajectory to improve stability and convergence.

Existing binaural approaches remain constrained by a two-stage pipeline that first generates mono audio and then performs spatialization, often resulting in error accumulation and spatio-temporal inconsistencies. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of end-to-end binaural spatial audio generation directly from silent video. To support this task, we present the BiAudio dataset, comprising approximately 97K video-binaural audio pairs spanning diverse real-world scenes and camera rotation trajectories, constructed through a semi-automated pipeline. Furthermore, we propose ViSAudio, an end-to-end framework that employs conditional flow matching with a dual-branch audio generation architecture, where two dedicated branches model the audio latent flows. Integrated with a conditional spacetime module, it balances consistency between channels while preserving distinctive spatial characteristics, ensuring precise spatio-temporal alignment between audio and the input video. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ViSAudio outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across both objective metrics and subjective evaluations, generating high-quality binaural audio with spatial immersion that adapts effectively to viewpoint changes, sound-source motion, and diverse acoustic environments.

To this end, we present Video4Spatial, a framework showing that video diffusion models conditioned solely on video-based scene context can perform complex spatial tasks. We validate on two tasks: scene navigation - following camera-pose instructions while remaining consistent with 3D geometry of the scene, and object grounding - which requires semantic localization, instruction following, and planning. Both tasks use video-only inputs, without auxiliary modalities such as depth or poses. With simple yet effective design choices in the framework and data curation, Video4Spatial demonstrates strong spatial understanding from video context: it plans navigation and grounds target objects end-to-end, follows camera-pose instructions while maintaining spatial consistency, and generalizes to long contexts and out-of-domain environments.

Our framework leverages the intrinsic architectural properties to support multi-shot video generation, featuring text-driven inter-shot consistency, customized subject with motion control, and background-driven customized scene.

In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "PPTArena\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8ePowerPoint\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u4fee\u6539\u3002PPTPilot\u662f\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7f16\u8f91\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684PowerPoint\u7f16\u8f91\u5de5\u5177\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf-PDF\u6e32\u67d3\u6216\u6587\u672c\u5230\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u9760\u539f\u4f4d\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002PPTArena\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8861\u91cf\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4e0b\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7684\u4fee\u6539\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "PPTArena\u5305\u542b100\u4e2a\u6f14\u793a\u6587\u7a3f\u30012125\u5f20\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u548c800\u591a\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u3002PPTPilot\u4ee3\u7406\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u8f91\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7f16\u7a0b\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027XML\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u8ba1\u5212-\u7f16\u8f91-\u68c0\u67e5\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "PPTPilot\u5728\u590d\u5408\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u654f\u611f\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u8de8\u5e7b\u706f\u7247\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u4e13\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u548c\u524d\u6cbfVLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u9ad8\u51fa10\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1PPTPilot\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u4ee3\u7406\u5728PPTArena\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u3001\u6587\u6863\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u7136\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8fd9\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u53ef\u9760PowerPoint\u7f16\u8f91\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches typically train separate models for different tasks and treat image and video reasoning as disjoint domains. This results in limited scalability toward a multimodal reasoning generalist, which restricts practical versatility and hinders potential knowledge sharing across tasks and modalities. To this end, we propose OneThinker, an all-in-one reasoning model that unifies image and video understanding across diverse fundamental visual tasks, including question answering, captioning, spatial and temporal grounding, tracking, and segmentation. To achieve this, we construct the OneThinker-600k training corpus covering all these tasks and employ commercial models for CoT annotation, resulting in OneThinker-SFT-340k for SFT cold start. Furthermore, we propose EMA-GRPO to handle reward heterogeneity in multi-task RL by tracking task-wise moving averages of reward standard deviations for balanced optimization. Extensive experiments on diverse visual benchmarks show that OneThinker delivers strong performance on 31 benchmarks, across 10 fundamental visual understanding tasks. Moreover, it exhibits effective knowledge transfer between certain tasks and preliminary zero-shot generalization ability, marking a step toward a unified multimodal reasoning generalist.

In this work, we first verify that the attention maps of these models acquire geometric correspondence throughout training, attending to the geometrically corresponding regions across reference and target views for view-consistent generation. However, this correspondence signal remains incomplete, with its accuracy degrading under large viewpoint changes. Building on these findings, we introduce CAMEO, a simple yet effective training technique that directly supervises attention maps using geometric correspondence to enhance both the training efficiency and generation quality of multi-view diffusion models. Notably, supervising a single attention layer is sufficient to guide the model toward learning precise correspondences, thereby preserving the geometry and structure of reference images, accelerating convergence, and improving novel view synthesis performance. CAMEO reduces the number of training iterations required for convergence by half while achieving superior performance at the same iteration counts.

While diffusion transformers excel at holistic generation, their use of singular, monolithic prompts fails to disentangle distinct user intentions for content, position, and appearance. To overcome this, our method deconstructs creative intent into a stack of controllable visual cues: a content layer for what to create, a spatial layer for where to place it, a structural layer for how it is shaped, and a color layer for its palette. Our technical contributions include a specialized data generation pipeline for context-aware content integration, a unified control module to process all visual cues, and a fine-tuned spatial branch for precise local editing, including object removal. Extensive experiments validate that this layered approach effectively resolves the user intention gap, granting creators direct, intuitive control over the generative process.", "AI": {"tldr": "MagicQuill V2\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u521b\u610f\u610f\u56fe\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u989c\u8272\u56db\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5c42\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u867d\u7136\u64c5\u957f\u6574\u4f53\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5185\u5bb9\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u521b\u5efa\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u7ed3\u6784\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u989c\u8272\u5c42\u63a7\u5236\u8c03\u8272\u677f\uff1b\u5305\u542b\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u5206\u5c42\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u521b\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u3001\u76f4\u89c2\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63a7\u5236", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u7ec4\u5408\u8303\u5f0f\u6210\u529f\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u5f62\u8f6f\u4ef6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd"}}
