Under Review", "summary": "Assistive robots operating in unstructured environments must understand not only what objects are, but what they can be used for. This requires grounding language-based action queries to objects that both afford the requested function and can be physically retrieved. Existing approaches often rely on black-box models or fixed affordance labels, limiting transparency, controllability, and reliability for human-facing applications. We introduce CRAFT-E, a modular neuro-symbolic framework that composes a structured verb-property-object knowledge graph with visual-language alignment and energy-based grasp reasoning. The system generates interpretable grounding paths that expose the factors influencing object selection and incorporates grasp feasibility as an integral part of affordance inference. We further construct a benchmark dataset with unified annotations for verb-object compatibility, segmentation, and grasp candidates, and deploy the full pipeline on a physical robot. CRAFT-E achieves competitive performance in static scenes, ImageNet-based functional retrieval, and real-world trials involving 20 verbs and 39 objects. The framework remains robust under perceptual noise and provides transparent, component-level diagnostics. By coupling symbolic reasoning with embodied perception, CRAFT-E offers an interpretable and customizable alternative to end-to-end models for affordance-grounded object selection, supporting trustworthy decision-making in assistive robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CRAFT-E\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u4f53\u529f\u80fd\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u56fa\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u9762\u5411\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u52a8\u8bcd-\u5c5e\u6027-\u5bf9\u8c61\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u80fd\u91cf\u7684\u6293\u53d6\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3001ImageNet\u529f\u80fd\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u6d89\u53ca20\u4e2a\u52a8\u8bcd\u548c39\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CRAFT-E\u4e3a\u529f\u80fd\u57fa\u7840\u7269\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002"}}

In realistic simulators such as CARLA, privileged state (e.g., lane geometry, infractions, time-to-collision) can be converted into dense rewards that stabilize and accelerate model-based reinforcement learning, but policies trained directly on these signals often overfit and fail to generalize when evaluated on sparse objectives such as route completion and collision-free overtaking. We propose reward-privileged world model distillation, a two-stage framework in which a teacher DreamerV3-style agent is first trained with a dense privileged reward, and only its latent dynamics are distilled into a student trained solely on sparse task rewards. Teacher and student share the same observation space (semantic bird's-eye-view images); privileged information enters only through the teacher's reward, and the student does not imitate the teacher's actions or value estimates. Instead, the student's world model is regularized to match the teacher's latent dynamics while its policy is learned from scratch on sparse success/failure signals. In CARLA lane-following and overtaking benchmarks, sparse-reward students outperform both dense-reward teachers and sparse-from-scratch baselines. On unseen lane-following routes, reward-privileged distillation improves success by about 23 percent relative to the dense teacher while maintaining comparable or better safety. On overtaking, students retain near-perfect performance on training routes and achieve up to a 27x improvement in success on unseen routes, with improved lane keeping. These results show that dense rewards can be leveraged to learn richer dynamics models while keeping the deployed policy optimized strictly for sparse, deployment-aligned objectives.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u7279\u6743\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u800c\u4e0d\u7ee7\u627f\u5176\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u6307\u6807\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u52a0\u901f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u8def\u7ebf\u5b8c\u6210\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\uff09\u4e0a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u7279\u6743\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6559\u5e08DreamerV3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ec5\u5c06\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u4efb\u52a1\u5956\u52b1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e2d\u3002\u5b66\u751f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6559\u5e08\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u7b56\u7565\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u6210\u529f/\u5931\u8d25\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u91cd\u65b0\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u8f66\u9053\u8ddf\u968f\u548c\u8d85\u8f66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5b66\u751f\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u8f66\u9053\u4e0a\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u7ea623%\uff0c\u5728\u8d85\u8f66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8def\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u8fbe27\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u90e8\u7f72\u7b56\u7565\u4e25\u683c\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u90e8\u7f72\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

These models have shown strong potential in generalization and reasoning, but achieving reliable and responsible robotic behavior in real-world settings remains an open challenge. In high-stakes environments, robotic agents must go beyond basic task execution to perform risk-aware reasoning, moral decision-making, and physically grounded planning. We introduce ResponsibleRobotBench, a systematic benchmark designed to evaluate and accelerate progress in responsible robotic manipulation from simulation to real world. This benchmark consists of 23 multi-stage tasks spanning diverse risk types, including electrical, chemical, and human-related hazards, and varying levels of physical and planning complexity. These tasks require agents to detect and mitigate risks, reason about safety, plan sequences of actions, and engage human assistance when necessary. Our benchmark includes a general-purpose evaluation framework that supports multimodal model-based agents with various action representation modalities. The framework integrates visual perception, context learning, prompt construction, hazard detection, reasoning and planning, and physical execution.

However, they continue to struggle with tasks requiring precise spatial and positional reasoning. ASCII art, a symbolic medium where characters encode structure and form, provides a unique probe of this limitation. We introduce ASCIIBench, a novel benchmark for evaluating both the generation and classification of ASCII-text images. ASCIIBench consists of a filtered dataset of 5,315 class-labeled ASCII images and is, to our knowledge, the first publicly available benchmark of its kind. Alongside the dataset, we release weights for a fine-tuned CLIP model adapted to capture ASCII structure, enabling the evaluation of LLM-generated ASCII art. Our analysis shows that cosine similarity over CLIP embeddings fails to separate most ASCII categories, yielding chance-level performance even for low-variance classes. In contrast, classes with high internal mean similarity exhibit clear discriminability, revealing that the bottleneck lies in representation rather than generational variance. These findings position ASCII art as a stress test for multimodal representations and motivate the development of new embedding methods or evaluation metrics tailored to symbolic visual modalities.

Existing methods model temporal artifacts as frame-to-frame instabilities, overlooking a key vulnerability: the violation of natural motion dependencies between different facial regions. In this paper, we propose a synthetic video generation method that creates training data with subtle kinematic inconsistencies. We train an autoencoder to decompose facial landmark configurations into motion bases. By manipulating these bases, we selectively break the natural correlations in facial movements and introduce these artifacts into pristine videos via face morphing.

These vehicles have limited processing capability and payload capacity, which makes advanced deep learning methods and heavy sensors impractical. Flying insects, such as bees, achieve remarkable landings with minimal neural and sensory resources, relying heavily on optical flow. By regulating flow divergence, a measure of vertical velocity divided by height, they perform smooth landings in which velocity and height decay exponentially together. However, adapting this bio-inspired strategy for spacecraft landings on sloped terrain presents two key challenges: global flow-divergence estimates obscure terrain inclination, and the nonlinear nature of divergence-based control can lead to instability when using conventional controllers. This paper proposes a nonlinear control strategy that leverages two distinct local flow divergence estimates to regulate both thrust and attitude during vertical landings. The control law is formulated based on Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion to handle the nonlinear flow divergence. The thrust control ensures a smooth vertical descent by keeping a constant average of the local flow divergence estimates, while the attitude control aligns the vehicle with the inclined surface at touchdown by exploiting their difference. The approach is evaluated in numerical simulations using a simplified 2D spacecraft model across varying slopes and divergence setpoints. Results show that regulating the average divergence yields stable landings with exponential decay of velocity and height, and using the divergence difference enables effective alignment with inclined terrain.

Yet such flexibility introduces a critical challenge: inference performance becomes highly sensitive to the decoding order of tokens. Existing heuristic methods, however, focus mainly on local effects while overlooking long-term impacts. To address this limitation, we propose the Foreseeing Decoding Method (FDM), a novel approach that integrates both local and global considerations to unlock the full potential, employing a search-based strategy to enable effective optimization in discrete spaces. Furthermore, by analyzing the consistency of chosen tokens in the full decoding process, we develop a variant, FDM with Acceleration (FDM-A), which restricts deep exploration to critical steps identified as the exploration and balance circumantences. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model architectures validate the scalability of FDM and demonstrate the superior efficiency-performance trade-off achieved by FDM-A.

Accessible as a single, self-contained executable file (https://onsightpathology.github.io/ ), OnSight Pathology operates locally on consumer-grade personal computers without complex software integration, enabling cost-effective and secure deployment in research and clinical workflows. Here we demonstrate the utility of OnSight Pathology using over 2,500 publicly available whole slide images across different slide viewers, as well as cases from our clinical digital pathology setup. The software's robustness is highlighted across routine histopathological tasks, including the classification of common brain tumor types, mitosis detection, and the quantification of immunohistochemical stains. A built-in multi-modal chat assistant provides verifiable descriptions of images, free of rigid class labels, for added quality control. Lastly, we show compatibility with live microscope camera feeds, including from personal smartphones, offering potential for deployment in more analog, inter-operative, and telepathology settings.

Our approach explicitly decouples locomotion and manipulation into two specialized visuomotor policies, allowing each subsystem to rely on its own observations. This mitigates the performance degradation that arise when a single policy is forced to fuse heterogeneous, potentially mismatched observations from locomotion and manipulation. Our key innovation lies in restoring coordination between these two independent policies through a vision-language foundation model, which encodes global observations and language instructions into a shared latent embedding conditioning both diffusion policies. On top of this backbone, we introduce a phase-progress head that uses textual descriptions of task stages to infer discrete phase and continuous progress estimates without manual phase labels. To further structure the latent space, we incorporate a coordination-aware contrastive loss that explicitly encodes cross-subsystem compatibility between arm and base actions.

Given a tabular data set and a corresponding error mask, the algorithm estimates whether or not the errors depend on the data using machine learning models. Our work extends established approaches to detect mechanisms underlying missing values and can be readily applied to other error types, provided that an error mask is available. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MechDetect in experiments on established benchmark datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MechDetect\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\u9519\u8bef\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5224\u65ad\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u5426\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\u76f8\u5173", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u9519\u8bef\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u4e86\u89e3\u9519\u8bef\u5982\u4f55\u751f\u6210\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8ffd\u8e2a\u548c\u4fee\u590d\u9519\u8bef", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e2d\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MechDetect\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u7ed9\u5b9a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u9519\u8bef\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MechDetect\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u9519\u8bef\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u524d\u63d0\u662f\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u63a9\u7801"}}

Traditional pipelines decouple detection, association, and tracking, leading to error propagation and temporal inconsistency in challenging scenarios. LAPA addresses these limitations by leveraging attention mechanisms to jointly reason across views and time, establishing soft correspondences through a cross-view attention mechanism enhanced with geometric priors. Instead of relying on classical triangulation, we construct 3D point representations via attention-weighted aggregation, inherently accommodating uncertainty and partial observations. Temporal consistency is further maintained through a transformer decoder that models long-range dependencies, preserving identities through extended occlusions. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including our newly created multi-camera (MC) versions of TAPVid-3D panoptic and PointOdyssey, demonstrate that our unified approach significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 37.5% APD on TAPVid-3D-MC and 90.3% APD on PointOdyssey-MC, particularly excelling in scenarios with complex motions and occlusions.

Current theories of rich feature learning effects revolve around networks with one or two trainable layers or deep linear networks. Furthermore, even under such limiting settings, predictions often appear in the form of high-dimensional non-linear equations, which require computationally intensive numerical solutions. Given the many details that go into defining a deep learning problem, this analytical complexity is a significant and often unavoidable challenge. Here, we propose a powerful heuristic route for predicting the data and width scales at which various patterns of feature learning emerge. This form of scale analysis is considerably simpler than such exact theories and reproduces the scaling exponents of various known results.

Under Review", "summary": "Humans naturally perceive continuous experience as a hierarchy of temporally nested events, fine-grained actions embedded within coarser routines. Replicating this structure in computer vision requires models that can segment video not just retrospectively, but predictively and hierarchically. We introduce PARSE, a unified framework that learns multiscale event structure directly from streaming video without supervision. PARSE organizes perception into a hierarchy of recurrent predictors, each operating at its own temporal granularity: lower layers model short-term dynamics while higher layers integrate longer-term context through attention-based feedback.

It remains fully com- patible with standard BT architectures, allowing seamless integration into existing multi-robot control systems. Within this framework, multi-robot cooperation is formulated as a free-energy minimization process, where each robot dynamically updates its preference matrix based on perceptual inputs and peer intentions, thereby achieving adaptive coordination in partially observ- able and dynamic environments. The proposed approach is validated through both simulation and real-world experiments, including a multi-robot maze navigation and a collaborative ma- nipulation task, compared against traditional BTs(https://youtu.be/KX_oT3IDTf4).

These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively.

With the growing adoption of industrial automation, online bin packing has gained increasing attention. However, inconsistencies in problem settings, test datasets, and evaluation metrics have hindered progress in the field, and there is a lack of a comprehensive benchmarking system. Direct testing on real hardware is costly, and building a realistic simulation environment is also challenging. To address these limitations, we introduce RoboBPP, a benchmarking system designed for robotic online bin packing. RoboBPP integrates a physics-based simulator to assess physical feasibility. In our simulation environment, we introduce a robotic arm and boxes at real-world scales to replicate real industrial packing workflows. By simulating conditions that arise in real industrial applications, we ensure that evaluated algorithms are practically deployable. In addition, prior studies often rely on synthetic datasets whose distributions differ from real-world industrial data. To address this issue, we collect three datasets from real industrial workflows, including assembly-line production, logistics packing, and furniture manufacturing.

The architecture you train with is the architecture you deploy. This assumption constrains the community from selecting architectures that may have desirable efficiency or design properties due to difficulties with optimization. We challenge this assumption with Network of Theseus (NoT), a method for progressively converting a trained, or even untrained, guide network architecture part-by-part into an entirely different target network architecture while preserving the performance of the guide network. At each stage, components in the guide network architecture are incrementally replaced with target architecture modules and aligned via representational similarity metrics. This procedure largely preserves the functionality of the guide network even under substantial architectural changes-for example, converting a convolutional network into a multilayer perceptron, or GPT-2 into a recurrent neural network.

Unlike RL methods for generative models, our framework aligns conditional intrinsic predictors by rewarding agreement between the judge's relational assessments and analytically derived relations from the model's outputs.

Moreover, their disassembly requires sequential, precise, and dexterous operations, further increasing the complexity of automation. Current robotic disassembly processes are typically divided into several stages: perception, sequence planning, task planning, motion planning, and manipulation. Each stage requires explicit modeling, which limits generalization to unfamiliar scenarios. Recent development of vision-language-action (VLA) models has presented an end-to-end approach for general robotic manipulation tasks. Although VLAs have demonstrated promising performance on simple tasks, the feasibility of applying such models to complex disassembly remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we collected a customized dataset for robotic RAM and CPU disassembly and used it to fine-tune two well-established VLA approaches, OpenVLA and OpenVLA-OFT, as a case study. We divided the whole disassembly task into several small steps, and our preliminary experimental results indicate that the fine-tuned VLA models can faithfully complete multiple early steps but struggle with certain critical subtasks, leading to task failure. However, we observed that a simple hybrid strategy that combines VLA with a rule-based controller can successfully perform the entire disassembly operation.

This allows for the rapid generation of precise and realistic schedules for different input labels. We extensively evaluate model capabilities using a joint density estimation framework and several case studies. We additionally show that our approach has practical data and computational requirements, and can be deployed within new and existing demand modelling frameworks. We evaluate the importance of generative capability more generally, by comparing our combined approach to (i) a purely generative model without conditionality, and (ii) a purely conditional model which outputs the most likely schedule given the input labels.

However, existing benchmarks primarily assess performance on common anatomical presentations and fail to capture the challenges posed by rare variants. To address this gap, we introduce AdversarialAnatomyBench, the first benchmark comprising naturally occurring rare anatomical variants across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical regions. We call such variants that violate learned priors about \"typical\" human anatomy natural adversarial anatomy. Benchmarking 22 state-of-the-art VLMs with AdversarialAnatomyBench yielded three key insights. First, when queried with basic medical perception tasks, mean accuracy dropped from 74% on typical to 29% on atypical anatomy. Even the best-performing models, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Llama 4 Maverick, showed performance drops of 41-51%. Second, model errors closely mirrored expected anatomical biases. Third, neither model scaling nor interventions, including bias-aware prompting and test-time reasoning, resolved these issues. These findings highlight a critical and previously unquantified limitation in current VLM: their poor generalization to rare anatomical presentations.

Prior approaches restrict inference to a predefined goal set, rely only on observed actions, or depend exclusively on explicit instructions, making them brittle in real-world interactions. We present BALI (Bidirectional Action-Language Inference) for goal prediction, a method that integrates natural language preferences with observed human actions in a receding-horizon planning tree.

Most existing studies typically consider the Rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function and centralized training environments. In this paper, we study the ML model robustness using ten different activation functions through adversarial training in centralized environments and explore the ML model robustness in federal learning environments. In the centralized environment, we first propose an advanced adversarial training approach to improving the ML model robustness by incorporating model architecture change, soft labeling, simplified data augmentation, and varying learning rates. Then, we conduct extensive experiments on ten well-known activation functions in addition to ReLU to better understand how they impact the ML model robustness. Furthermore, we extend the proposed adversarial training approach to the federal learning environment, where both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data settings are considered. Our proposed centralized adversarial training approach achieves a natural and robust accuracy of 77.08% and 67.96%, respectively on CIFAR-10 against the fast gradient sign attacks. Experiments on ten activation functions reveal ReLU usually performs best. In the federated learning environment, however, the robust accuracy decreases significantly, especially on non-IID data. To address the significant performance drop in the non-IID data case, we introduce data sharing and achieve the natural and robust accuracy of 70.09% and 54.79%, respectively, surpassing the CalFAT algorithm, when 40% data sharing is used. That is, a proper percentage of data sharing can significantly improve the ML model robustness, which is useful to some real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e8610\u79cd\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8ReLU\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5176\u4ed6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u53d8\u3001\u8f6f\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u7b80\u5316\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff1b\u5728\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f8310\u79cd\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u95ee\u9898\u5f15\u5165\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523077.08%\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c67.96%\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1bReLU\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c40%\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u53ef\u5c06\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f370.09%\u548c54.79%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u9002\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff0cReLU\u901a\u5e38\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b\u6570\u636e\u5171\u4eab\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Existing methods such as domain randomization, adaptation, and sim-real calibration often require extensive tuning or fail to generalize to unseen scenarios. To address this issue, we observe that if domain-invariant features are utilized during policy training in simulation, and the same features can be extracted and provided as the input to policy during real-world deployment, the domain gap can be effectively bridged, leading to significantly improved policy generalization. Accordingly, we propose Semantic 2D Gaussian Splatting (S2GS), a novel representation method that extracts object-centric, domain-invariant spatial features. S2GS constructs multi-view 2D semantic fields and projects them into a unified 3D space via feature-level Gaussian splatting. A semantic filtering mechanism removes irrelevant background content, ensuring clean and consistent inputs for policy learning. To evaluate the effectiveness of S2GS, we adopt Diffusion Policy as the downstream learning algorithm and conduct experiments in the ManiSkill simulation environment, followed by real-world deployment.

Previous work connects linear self-attention (LSA) to gradient descent (GD), this connection has primarily been established under simplified conditions with zero-mean Gaussian priors and zero initialization for GD. However, subsequent studies have challenged this simplified view by highlighting its overly restrictive assumptions, demonstrating instead that under conditions such as multi-layer or nonlinear attention, self-attention performs optimization-like inference, akin to but distinct from GD. We investigate how multi-head LSA approximates GD under more realistic conditions specifically when incorporating non-zero Gaussian prior means in linear regression formulations of ICL. We first extend multi-head LSA embedding matrix by introducing an initial estimation of the query, referred to as the initial guess. We prove an upper bound on the number of heads needed for ICL linear regression setup. Our experiments confirm this result and further observe that a performance gap between one-step GD and multi-head LSA persists. To address this gap, we introduce yq-LSA, a simple generalization of single-head LSA with a trainable initial guess yq. We theoretically establish the capabilities of yq-LSA and provide experimental validation on linear regression tasks, thereby extending the theory that bridges ICL and GD. Finally, inspired by our findings in the case of linear regression, we consider widespread LLMs augmented with initial guess capabilities, and show that their performance is improved on a semantic similarity task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u591a\u5934\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08LSA\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff08GD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u6269\u5c55\u4e86ICL\u4e0eGD\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u96f6\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u7b80\u5316\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u975e\u96f6\u9ad8\u65af\u5148\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\uff09\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u5934LSA\u5982\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3cGD\u3002", "method": "1. \u6269\u5c55\u591a\u5934LSA\u5d4c\u5165\u77e9\u9635\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\uff08\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\uff09 2. \u63d0\u51fayq-LSA\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5e26\u6709\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u7684\u5355\u5934LSA\u6cdb\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f 3. \u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1 4. \u5c06\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ICL\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u5934\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u754c 2. \u5b9e\u9a8c\u786e\u8ba4\u4e86\u5355\u6b65GD\u4e0e\u591a\u5934LSA\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd 3. yq-LSA\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272 4. \u5e26\u6709\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684LLMs\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u5f97\u5230\u63d0\u5347", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u731c\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86ICL\u4e0eGD\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u66f4\u73b0\u5b9e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u591a\u5934LSA\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fd1\u4f3cGD\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aLLMs\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

To improve the diversity of such sequential forecasts we propose a novel inference-time refinement technique that combines Gated Recurrent Unit-Normalizing Flows (GRU-NF) with stochastic sampling methods. While GRU-NF can capture multimodal distributions through its integration of normalizing flows within a temporal forecasting framework, its deterministic transformation structure can limit expressivity. To address this, inspired by Stochastic Normalizing Flows (SNF), we introduce Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) steps during GRU-NF inference, enabling the model to explore a richer output space and better approximate the true data distribution without retraining. We validate our approach in a keypoint-based video motion transfer pipeline, where capturing temporally coherent and perceptually diverse future trajectories is essential for realistic samples and low bandwidth communication. Experiments show that our inference framework, Gated Recurrent Unit- Stochastic Normalizing Flows (GRU-SNF) outperforms GRU-NF in generating diverse outputs without sacrificing accuracy, even under longer prediction horizons. By injecting stochasticity during inference, our approach captures multimodal behavior more effectively.

Inspired by this biological synergy, embodied co-design (ECD) has emerged as a transformative paradigm for creating intelligent agents-from virtual creatures to physical robots-by jointly optimizing their morphologies and controllers rather than treating control in isolation. This integrated approach facilitates richer environmental interactions and robust task performance. In this survey, we provide a systematic overview of recent advances in ECD. We first formalize the concept of ECD and position it within related fields. We then introduce a hierarchical taxonomy: a lower layer that breaks down agent design into three fundamental components-controlling brain, body morphology, and task environment-and an upper layer that integrates these components into four major ECD frameworks: bi-level, single-level, generative, and open-ended. This taxonomy allows us to synthesize insights from more than one hundred recent studies. We further review notable benchmarks, datasets, and applications in both simulated and real-world scenarios.

We ask whether a scalar hint toward a canonical solver ordering, used only during RL post-training, improves performance even when fine-tuned on randomized solution sequences. On Sudoku, we train a Transformer with standard fine-tuning on randomized solving orders, then post-train it with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with two rewards: cell accuracy and an ordering reward that increases when the model's emission order aligns with the solver order. To compare signals cleanly, we combine them via fixed mixtures and use a simple bootstrapped scaling to equalize component magnitudes at initialization. Mixed rewards generally outperform cell-only optimization--the best mixture yields substantially higher test accuracy than the fine-tuned-only model trained on random-order and approaches the fine-tuned-only model trained on solver-order sequences in accuracy. These results suggest that coarse ordering signals can steer RL post-training toward solver-order trajectories without modifying supervised data or architecture.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5982\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u5355\u5143\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u5143\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u6807\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7d22\u5728RL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u662f\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u89e3\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u6570\u72ec\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u6807\u51c6\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u968f\u673a\u6c42\u89e3\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff08GRPO\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\uff1a\u5355\u5143\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u987a\u5e8f\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7ec4\u5408\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u81ea\u4e3e\u7f29\u653e\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u5404\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u5143\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u2014\u2014\u6700\u4f73\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u987a\u5e8f\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f7f\u7528\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7c97\u7565\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u6216\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfcRL\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u671d\u5411\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, the theoretical understanding of PnP-Flow lags its empirical success. In this paper, we derive a continuous limit for PnP-Flow, resulting in a stochastic differential equation (SDE) surrogate model of PnP-Flow. The SDE model provides two particular insights to improve PnP-Flow for image restoration: (1) It enables us to quantify the error for image restoration, informing us to improve step scheduling and regularize the Lipschitz constant of the neural network-parameterized vector field for error reduction. (2) It informs us to accelerate off-the-shelf PnP-Flow models via extrapolation, resulting in a rescaled version of the proposed SDE model. We validate the efficacy of the SDE-informed improved PnP-Flow using several benchmark tasks, including image denoising, deblurring, super-resolution, and inpainting.

The absence of a realistic common benchmark represents a significant limitation for the diffusion of robust autonomous systems under real complex agricultural conditions. Vineyards pose significant challenges due to their dynamic nature, and they are increasingly drawing attention from both academic and industrial stakeholders interested in automation. In this context, we introduce the TEMPO-VINE dataset, a large-scale multi-temporal dataset specifically designed for evaluating sensor fusion, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and place recognition techniques within operational vineyard environments. TEMPO-VINE is the first multi-modal public dataset that brings together data from heterogeneous LiDARs of different price levels, AHRS, RTK-GPS, and cameras in real trellis and pergola vineyards, with multiple rows exceeding 100 m in length. In this work, we address a critical gap in the landscape of agricultural datasets by providing researchers with a comprehensive data collection and ground truth trajectories in different seasons, vegetation growth stages, terrain and weather conditions. The sequence paths with multiple runs and revisits will foster the development of sensor fusion, localization, mapping and place recognition solutions for agricultural fields.

We introduce GRASP - GRouped Activation Shared Parameterization - a lightweight PEFT framework that partitions the D-dimensional token representations of selected layers into K << D groups and learns a shared scaling and shifting vector for each group. This grouped modulation reduces the number of trainable parameters significantly while preserving the ability of the model to learn task-specific features. Building on this formulation, we further propose StochGRASP, which learns Gaussian distributions as perturbations to the pre-trained weights rather than deterministic values.

In data-driven missions, besides sensing, the drone must process the collected data at runtime to decide whether additional action must be taken on the spot, before moving to the next point of interest.

If, however, the drone starts moving to the next point and it turns out that a follow-up action is needed at the previous point, it must spend time to fly-back.

We propose a simple layerwise condition that predicts when a spectral update yields a larger decrease in the loss than a Euclidean gradient step. This condition compares, for each parameter block, the squared nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio of the gradient to the stable rank of the incoming activations. To understand when this condition may be satisfied, we first prove that post-activation matrices have low stable rank at Gaussian initialization in random feature regression, feedforward networks, and transformer blocks. In spiked random feature models we then show that, after a short burn-in, the Euclidean gradient's nuclear-to-Frobenius ratio grows with the data dimension while the stable rank of the activations remains bounded, so the predicted advantage of spectral updates scales with dimension. We validate these predictions in synthetic regression experiments and in NanoGPT-scale language model training, where we find that intermediate activations have low-stable-rank throughout training and the corresponding gradients maintain large nuclear-to-Frobenius ratios.

However, conventional monocular depth estimation often oversmooths these features, losing critical information for motion planning and stability. To address this, we introduce Gamma-from-Mono (GfM), a lightweight monocular geometry estimation method that resolves the projective ambiguity in single-camera reconstruction by decoupling global and local structure. GfM predicts a dominant road surface plane together with residual variations expressed by gamma, a dimensionless measure of vertical deviation from the plane, defined as the ratio of a point's height above it to its depth from the camera, and grounded in established planar parallax geometry. With only the camera's height above ground, this representation deterministically recovers metric depth via a closed form, avoiding full extrinsic calibration and naturally prioritizing near-road detail.

Despite prior work on collecting large-scale datasets, there still remains a significant gap to robust spatial generalization. We identify a key limitation: individual trajectories, regardless of their length, are typically collected from a \\emph{single, static spatial configuration} of the environment. This includes fixed object and target spatial positions as well as unchanging camera viewpoints, which significantly restricts the diversity of spatial information available for learning. To address this critical bottleneck in data efficiency, we propose \\textbf{MOtion-Based Variability Enhancement} (\\emph{MOVE}), a simple yet effective data collection paradigm that enables the acquisition of richer spatial information from dynamic demonstrations. Our core contribution is an augmentation strategy that injects motion into any movable objects within the environment for each demonstration. This process implicitly generates a dense and diverse set of spatial configurations within a single trajectory. We conduct extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world environments to validate our approach. For example, in simulation tasks requiring strong spatial generalization, \\emph{MOVE} achieves an average success rate of 39.1\\%, a 76.1\\% relative improvement over the static data collection paradigm (22.2\\%), and yields up to 2--5$\\times$ gains in data efficiency on certain tasks.

However, the performance of these agents in long context scenarios, particularly for action-taking WebAgents operating in realistic web environments, remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a benchmark for evaluating long context reasoning capabilities of WebAgents through sequentially dependent subtasks that require retrieval and application of information from extended interaction histories. We develop a novel evaluation framework that simulates multi-session user interactions by injecting irrelevant task trajectories between dependent subtasks, creating contexts ranging from 25,000 to 150,000 tokens. Through extensive evaluation of four popular models, Claude-3.7, GPT-4.1, Llama 4, and o4-mini, we observe a dramatic performance degradation as context length increases, with success rates dropping from 40-50\\% in baseline conditions to less than 10\\% in long context scenarios. Our detailed error analysis reveals that agents primarily fail due to getting stuck in loops and losing track of original task objectives. We further propose an implicit RAG approach that provides modest improvements by generating task-relevant summaries, though fundamental limitations in long context reasoning persist. These findings highlight critical challenges for deploying WebAgents in realistic, long-term user interaction scenarios and provide insights for developing more robust agent architectures capable of maintaining coherent task execution across extended contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30WebAgents\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u5f0fRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u65e5\u5e38\u6570\u5b57\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u957f\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f51\u7edc\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684WebAgents\uff0c\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u5165\u4e0d\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u4f1a\u8bdd\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u521b\u5efa\u4e8625,000\u5230150,000\u4e2a\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u6d41\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9690\u5f0fRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u6458\u8981\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u968f\u7740\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ece\u57fa\u7ebf\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u768440-50%\u964d\u81f3\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u8db310%\u3002\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4ee3\u7406\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u9677\u5165\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u4e22\u5931\u539f\u59cb\u4efb\u52a1\u76ee\u6807\u800c\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u9690\u5f0fRAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u9650\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u957f\u671f\u7528\u6237\u4ea4\u4e92\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72WebAgents\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u8fde\u8d2f\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u7684\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4ee3\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Although a few prior works have examined CLIP calibration in offline settings, the impact of fine-tuning CLIP in a federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\\text{FL}^2\\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that $\\text{FL}^2\\text{oRA}$ consistently produces well-calibrated models, reducing the need for explicit calibration procedures.

Three planned reference trajectories are compared against a free-driving baseline (NOREF) to assess trade-offs between lap time (LT) and steering effort (SE): NOM, the nominal time-optimal trajectory; TLC, a track-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening margins to the track edges; and FLC, a friction-limit-robust trajectory obtained by tightening against axle and tire saturation. All trajectories share the same minimum lap-time objective with a small steering-smoothness regularizer and are evaluated by two professional drivers using a high-performance car on a virtual track. The trajectories derive from a disturbance-aware minimum-lap-time framework recently proposed by the authors, where worst-case disturbance growth is propagated over a finite horizon and used to tighten tire-friction and track-limit constraints, preserving performance while providing probabilistic safety margins. LT and SE are used as performance indicators, while RMS lateral deviation, speed error, and drift angle characterize driving style. Results show a Pareto-like LT-SE trade-off: NOM yields the shortest LT but highest SE; TLC minimizes SE at the cost of longer LT; FLC lies near the efficient frontier, substantially reducing SE relative to NOM with only a small LT increase. Removing trajectory guidance (NOREF) increases both LT and SE, confirming that reference trajectories improve pace and control efficiency. Overall, the findings highlight reference-based and disturbance-aware planning, especially FLC, as effective tools for training and for achieving fast yet stable trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08NOM\u3001TLC\u3001FLC\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0FLC\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u5feb\u5708\u901f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8f6c\u5411\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5708\u901f\u4e0e\u8f6c\u5411\u8d1f\u62c5\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4f5c\u8005\u6700\u8fd1\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u6700\u5c0f\u5708\u65f6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u5185\u4f20\u64ad\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u6536\u7d27\u8f6e\u80ce\u6469\u64e6\u548c\u8d5b\u9053\u8fb9\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u7531\u4e24\u540d\u4e13\u4e1a\u8f66\u624b\u5728\u865a\u62df\u8d5b\u9053\u4e0a\u9a7e\u9a76\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u6c7d\u8f66\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\uff08NOM\u3001TLC\u3001FLC\uff09\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08NOREF\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u5f0f\u7684\u5708\u901f-\u8f6c\u5411\u8d1f\u62c5\u6743\u8861\uff1aNOM\u8f68\u8ff9\u5708\u901f\u6700\u77ed\u4f46\u8f6c\u5411\u8d1f\u62c5\u6700\u9ad8\uff1bTLC\u8f68\u8ff9\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8f6c\u5411\u8d1f\u62c5\u4f46\u5708\u901f\u8f83\u957f\uff1bFLC\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a5\u8fd1\u6548\u7387\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8f6c\u5411\u8d1f\u62c5\u800c\u5708\u901f\u4ec5\u5c0f\u5e45\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u65f6\u5708\u901f\u548c\u8f6c\u5411\u8d1f\u62c5\u5747\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fFLC\uff09\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u5708\u901f\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

Most existing algorithms are often vulnerable to reward hacking, such as quality degradation, over-stylization, or reduced diversity. Our analysis demonstrates that this can be attributed to the inherent limitations of their regularization, which provides unreliable penalties. We introduce Data-regularized Diffusion Reinforcement Learning (DDRL), a novel framework that uses the forward KL divergence to anchor the policy to an off-policy data distribution. Theoretically, DDRL enables robust, unbiased integration of RL with standard diffusion training. Empirically, this translates into a simple yet effective algorithm that combines reward maximization with diffusion loss minimization. With over a million GPU hours of experiments and ten thousand double-blind human evaluations, we demonstrate on high-resolution video generation tasks that DDRL significantly improves rewards while alleviating the reward hacking seen in baselines, achieving the highest human preference and establishing a robust and scalable paradigm for diffusion post-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "DDRL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u5f97\u5206\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578bRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\uff09\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u5176\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6269\u6563\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DDRL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548c\u6269\u6563\u635f\u5931\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8d85\u8fc7100\u4e07GPU\u5c0f\u65f6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c1\u4e07\u6b21\u53cc\u76f2\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDDRL\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u5e76\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u7834\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "DDRL\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86RL\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u6563\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u65e0\u504f\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

This work presents a low-cost, real-time system for automated sex-based sorting of Acheta domesticus, combining computer vision and physical actuation. The device integrates a Raspberry Pi 5 with the official Raspberry AI Camera and a custom YOLOv8 nano object detection model, together with a servo-actuated sorting arm. The model reached a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.5 (mAP@0.5) of 0.977 during testing, and real-world experiments with groups of crickets achieved an overall sorting accuracy of 86.8%.

In this work, we introduce Hybrid-Diffusion models that combine open-loop routines with visuomotor diffusion policies. We develop Teleoperation Augmentation Primitives (TAPs) that allow the operator to perform predefined routines, such as locking specific axes, moving to perching waypoints, or triggering task-specific routines seamlessly during demonstrations.

The data are high-dimensional, and conventional statistical methods often fail to capture the complex relationships between genes. In this study, we introduce RGE-GCN (Recursive Gene Elimination with Graph Convolutional Networks), a framework that combines feature selection and classification in a single pipeline. Our approach builds a graph from gene expression profiles, uses a Graph Convolutional Network to classify cancer versus normal samples, and applies Integrated Gradients to highlight the most informative genes. By recursively removing less relevant genes, the model converges to a compact set of biomarkers that are both interpretable and predictive. We evaluated RGE-GCN on synthetic data as well as real-world RNA-seq cohorts of lung, kidney, and cervical cancers. Across all datasets, the method consistently achieved higher accuracy and F1-scores than standard tools such as DESeq2, edgeR, and limma-voom. Importantly, the selected genes aligned with well-known cancer pathways including PI3K-AKT, MAPK, SUMOylation, and immune regulation.

Through extensive evaluation, we show that EEG alone can reliably predict dynamic, subject-specific facial expressions, including subtle emotional responses, demonstrating that neural signals contain far richer affective and geometric information than previously assumed.

In this work, we question the universality of this principle and instead revisit a complementary one: a Bayesian perspective. Rather than enforcing conservatism, the Bayesian approach tackles epistemic uncertainty in offline data by modeling a posterior distribution over plausible world models and training a history-dependent agent to maximize expected rewards, enabling test-time generalization. We first illustrate, in a bandit setting, that Bayesianism excels on low-quality datasets where conservatism fails. We then scale the principle to realistic tasks, identifying key design choices, such as layer normalization in the world model and adaptive long-horizon planning, that mitigate compounding error and value overestimation. These yield our practical algorithm, Neubay, grounded in the neutral Bayesian principle. On D4RL and NeoRL benchmarks, Neubay generally matches or surpasses leading conservative algorithms, achieving new state-of-the-art on 7 datasets.

This problem is especially pronounced in hyperspectral imaging, from satellite hyperspectral remote sensing to infrared pathology imaging, where channels capture distinct biophysical or biochemical cues. We propose DisentangleFormer, an architecture that achieves robust multi-channel vision representation through principled spatial-channel decoupling. Motivated by information-theoretic principles of decorrelated representation learning, our parallel design enables independent modeling of structural and semantic cues while minimizing redundancy between spatial and channel streams. Our design integrates three core components: (1) Parallel Disentanglement: Independently processes spatial-token and channel-token streams, enabling decorrelated feature learning across spatial and spectral dimensions, (2) Squeezed Token Enhancer: An adaptive calibration module that dynamically fuses spatial and channel streams, and (3) Multi-Scale FFN: complementing global attention with multi-scale local context to capture fine-grained structural and semantic dependencies. Extensive experiments on hyperspectral benchmarks demonstrate that DisentangleFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming existing models on Indian Pine, Pavia University, and Houston, the large-scale BigEarthNet remote sensing dataset, as well as an infrared pathology dataset. Moreover, it retains competitive accuracy on ImageNet while reducing computational cost by 17.8% in FLOPs.

However, they fall short of replicating the natural movement and interaction capabilities of the human arm. In contrast, human limbs leverage intrinsic compliance and actively modulate joint stiffness, enabling adaptive responses to varying tasks, impact absorption, and efficient energy transfer during dynamic actions. Inspired by this adaptability, we developed a transhumeral prosthesis with Variable Stiffness Actuators (VSAs) to replicate the controllable compliance found in biological joints. The proposed prosthesis features a modular design, allowing customization for different residual limb shapes and accommodating a range of independent control signals derived from users' biological cues. Integrated elastic elements passively support more natural movements, facilitate safe interactions with the environment, and adapt to diverse task requirements.

We present a novel multi-video 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) approach designed to handle real-world, unsynchronized video sets. Our approach, SyncTrack4D, directly leverages dense 4D track representation of dynamic scene parts as cues for simultaneous cross-video synchronization and 4DGS reconstruction. We first compute dense per-video 4D feature tracks and cross-video track correspondences by Fused Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport approach. Next, we perform global frame-level temporal alignment to maximize overlapping motion of matched 4D tracks. Finally, we achieve sub-frame synchronization through our multi-video 4D Gaussian splatting built upon a motion-spline scaffold representation. The final output is a synchronized 4DGS representation with dense, explicit 3D trajectories, and temporal offsets for each video. We evaluate our approach on the Panoptic Studio and SyncNeRF Blender, demonstrating sub-frame synchronization accuracy with an average temporal error below 0.26 frames, and high-fidelity 4D reconstruction reaching 26.3 PSNR scores on the Panoptic Studio dataset.

A contact-implicit formulation is used to model distributed frictional interactions during sidewinding, and validated through MATLAB Simscape simulations and physical experiments on rigid ground and loose sand. To capture terrain deformation effects, Project Chrono's Soil Contact Model (SCM) is integrated with the articulated multibody dynamics, enabling prediction of slip, sinkage, and load redistribution that reduce stride efficiency on deformable substrates. For high-energy rolling locomotion on steep slopes, the Chrono DEM Engine is used to simulate particle-resolved granular interactions, revealing soil failure, intermittent lift-off, and energy dissipation mechanisms not captured by rigid models. Together, these methods span real-time control-oriented simulation and high-fidelity granular physics. Results demonstrate that rigid-ground models provide accurate short-horizon motion prediction, while continuum and particle-based terrain modeling becomes necessary for reliable mobility analysis in soft and highly dynamic environments.

Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing.", "AI": {"tldr": "SmartAlert\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8615%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u4f46\u4f4e\u6548\u7684\u533b\u7597\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u60a3\u8005\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u533b\u7597\u6210\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u5982\u6559\u80b2\u548c\u7535\u5b50\u8b66\u62a5\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u6216\u5f71\u54cd\u6b63\u5e38\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u7597\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684SmartAlert\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u57288\u4e2a\u6025\u6027\u62a4\u7406\u5355\u4f4d\u76849270\u4f8b\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u968f\u673a\u5bf9\u7167\u8bd5\u70b9\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u5168\u8840\u7ec6\u80de\u8ba1\u6570\uff08CBC\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "result": "SmartAlert\u663e\u793a\u540e52\u5c0f\u65f6\u5185CBC\u7ed3\u679c\u6570\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\uff081.54 vs 1.82\uff0cp<0.01\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u51cf\u5c1115%\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u6b21\u8981\u5b89\u5168\u7ed3\u5c40\u65e0\u4e0d\u826f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9a71\u52a8\u7684CDS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ed3\u5408\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u4e3a\u4f4f\u9662\u60a3\u8005\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u51c6\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u91cd\u590d\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

By randomly generating control point coordinates, we construct displacement fields that encompass a variety of realistic displacement scenarios, which are subsequently used to generate speckle pattern datasets. This approach enables the generation of a large-scale dataset that capture real-world displacement field situations, thereby enhancing the training and generalization capabilities of deep learning-based DIC algorithms. Additionally, we propose a novel network architecture, termed Bayes-DIC Net, which extracts information at multiple levels during the down-sampling phase and facilitates the aggregation of information across various levels through a single skip connection during the up-sampling phase. Bayes-DIC Net incorporates a series of lightweight convolutional blocks designed to expand the receptive field and capture rich contextual information while minimizing computational costs. Furthermore, by integrating appropriate dropout modules into Bayes-DIC Net and activating them during the network inference stage, Bayes-DIC Net is transformed into a Bayesian neural network. This transformation allows the network to provide not only predictive results but also confidence levels in these predictions when processing real unlabeled datasets. This feature significantly enhances the practicality and reliability of our network in real-world displacement field prediction tasks.

To realize this potential, a key research question remains open: how can a humanoid execute the human actions from generated videos in a zero-shot manner? This challenge arises because generated videos are often noisy and exhibit morphological distortions that make direct imitation difficult compared to real video. To address this, we introduce a two-stage pipeline. First, we lift video pixels into a 4D human representation and then retarget to the humanoid morphology. Second, we propose GenMimic-a physics-aware reinforcement learning policy conditioned on 3D keypoints, and trained with symmetry regularization and keypoint-weighted tracking rewards. As a result, GenMimic can mimic human actions from noisy, generated videos. We curate GenMimicBench, a synthetic human-motion dataset generated using two video generation models across a spectrum of actions and contexts, establishing a benchmark for assessing zero-shot generalization and policy robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate improvements over strong baselines in simulation and confirm coherent, physically stable motion tracking on a Unitree G1 humanoid robot without fine-tuning.

Deploying portable sensors on mobile platforms such as cars and buses offers a low-cost, easy-to-maintain, and wide-coverage data collection solution. However, due to the random and uncontrollable movement patterns of these non-dedicated mobile platforms, the resulting sensor data are often incomplete and temporally inconsistent. By exploring potential training patterns in the reverse process of diffusion models, we propose Spatio-Temporal Physics-Informed Diffusion Models (STeP-Diff). STeP-Diff leverages DeepONet to model the spatial sequence of measurements along with a PDE-informed diffusion model to forecast the spatio-temporal field from incomplete and time-varying data. Through a PDE-constrained regularization framework, the denoising process asymptotically converges to the convection-diffusion dynamics, ensuring that predictions are both grounded in real-world measurements and aligned with the fundamental physics governing pollution dispersion. To assess the performance of the system, we deployed 59 self-designed portable sensing devices in two cities, operating for 14 days to collect air pollution data. Compared to the second-best performing algorithm, our model achieved improvements of up to 89.12% in MAE, 82.30% in RMSE, and 25.00% in MAPE, with extensive evaluations demonstrating that STeP-Diff effectively captures the spatio-temporal dependencies in air pollution fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STeP-Diff\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4ece\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e73\u53f0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u5e7f\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u53ef\u63a7\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408DeepONet\u5efa\u6a21\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528PDE-informed\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6e10\u8fdb\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6d41-\u6269\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u90e8\u7f7259\u4e2a\u4fbf\u643a\u4f20\u611f\u8bbe\u5907\u8fdb\u884c14\u5929\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b21\u4f18\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0cMAE\u63d0\u534789.12%\uff0cRMSE\u63d0\u534782.30%\uff0cMAPE\u63d0\u534725.00%\u3002", "conclusion": "STeP-Diff\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u573a\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u65e2\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53c8\u4e0e\u6c61\u67d3\u6269\u6563\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

We introduce NN-RAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system that converts large, heterogeneous PyTorch codebases into a searchable and executable library of validated neural modules. Unlike conventional code search or clone-detection tools, NN-RAG performs scope-aware dependency resolution, import-preserving reconstruction, and validator-gated promotion -- ensuring that every retrieved block is scope-closed, compilable, and runnable. Applied to 19 major repositories, the pipeline extracted 1,289 candidate blocks, validated 941 (73.0%), and demonstrated that over 80% are structurally unique. Through multi-level de-duplication (exact, lexical, structural), we find that NN-RAG contributes the overwhelming majority of unique architectures to the LEMUR dataset, supplying approximately 72% of all novel network structures. Beyond quantity, NN-RAG uniquely enables cross-repository migration of architectural patterns, automatically identifying reusable modules in one project and regenerating them, dependency-complete, in another context. To our knowledge, no other open-source system provides this capability at scale. The framework's neutral specifications further allow optional integration with language models for synthesis or dataset registration without redistributing third-party code.

Existing methods often treat long-horizon actions as linguistic sequences and apply trajectory-level optimization methods such as Trajectory-wise Preference Optimization (TPO) or Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), leading to coarse credit assignment and unstable training. However, unlike language, where a unified semantic meaning is preserved despite flexible sentence order, action trajectories progress through causally chained stages with different learning difficulties. This motivates progressive stage optimization. Thereby, we present Stage-Aware Reinforcement (STARE), a module that decomposes a long-horizon action trajectory into semantically meaningful stages and provides dense, interpretable, and stage-aligned reinforcement signals. Integrating STARE into TPO and PPO, we yield Stage-Aware TPO (STA-TPO) and Stage-Aware PPO (STA-PPO) for offline stage-wise preference and online intra-stage interaction, respectively. Further building on supervised fine-tuning as initialization, we propose the Imitation -> Preference -> Interaction (IPI), a serial fine-tuning pipeline for improving action accuracy in VLA models.

We show that, by learning optimal coordination strategies over pools of powerful worker LLMs, a 7B Conductor achieves significant performance gains beyond any individual worker, attaining state-of-the-art results in challenging reasoning benchmarks, such as LiveCodeBench and GPQA. By training with randomized agent pools, our conductor effectively adapts to arbitrary sets of open- and closed-source agents, meeting any user requirements. Furthermore, allowing the Conductor to select itself as a worker gives rise to recursive topologies, elevating performance with a new form of dynamic test-time scaling through online iterative adaptation.

Given the rapid development of face forgery generation algorithms, new fake categories are likely to keep appearing, posing a major challenge to existing face forgery detection methods. Despite recent advances in face forgery detection, existing methods are typically limited to binary Real-vs-Fake classification or the identification of known fake categories, and are incapable of detecting the emergence of novel types of forgeries. In this work, we study the Open Set Face Forgery Detection (OSFFD) problem, which demands that the detection model recognize novel fake categories. We reformulate the OSFFD problem and address it through uncertainty estimation, enhancing its applicability to real-world scenarios. Specifically, we propose the Dual-Level Evidential face forgery Detection (DLED) approach, which collects and fuses category-specific evidence on the spatial and frequency levels to estimate prediction uncertainty. Extensive evaluations conducted across diverse experimental settings demonstrate that the proposed DLED method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming various baseline models by an average of 20% in detecting forgeries from novel fake categories. Moreover, on the traditional Real-versus-Fake face forgery detection task, our DLED method concurrently exhibits competitive performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08OSFFD\uff09\u7684\u53cc\u5c42\u8bc1\u636e\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DLED\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u578b\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b20%\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u65b0\u578b\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u65ad\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u4e8c\u5143\u771f\u5b9evs\u4f2a\u9020\u5206\u7c7b\u6216\u5df2\u77e5\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u522b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5c42\u8bc1\u636e\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08DLED\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u9891\u7387\u5c42\u9762\u6536\u96c6\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u7c7b\u522b\u7279\u5b9a\u8bc1\u636e\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u89e3\u51b3\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cDLED\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b0\u578b\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b20%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u771f\u5b9evs\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DLED\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u96c6\u4eba\u8138\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u578b\u4f2a\u9020\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing EQA benchmarks assume that every question must be answered, but embodied agents should know when they do not have sufficient information to answer. In this work, we focus on a minimal requirement for EQA agents, abstention: knowing when to withhold an answer. From an initial study of 500 human queries, we find that 32.4% contain missing or underspecified context. Drawing on this initial study and cognitive theories of human communication errors, we derive five representative categories requiring abstention: actionability limitation, referential underspecification, preference dependence, information unavailability, and false presupposition. We augment OpenEQA by having annotators transform well-posed questions into ambiguous variants outlined by these categories. The resulting dataset, AbstainEQA, comprises 1,636 annotated abstention cases paired with 1,636 original OpenEQA instances for balanced evaluation. Evaluating on AbstainEQA, we find that even the best frontier model only attains 42.79% abstention recall, while humans achieve 91.17%. We also find that scaling, prompting, and reasoning only yield marginal gains, and that fine-tuned models overfit to textual cues. Together, these results position abstention as a fundamental prerequisite for reliable interaction in embodied settings and as a necessary basis for effective clarification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AbstainEQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u4f53\u5316\u95ee\u7b54\u4e2d\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5373\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u77e5\u9053\u4f55\u65f6\u56e0\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u7b54\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5f03\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a42.79%\uff0c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u768491.17%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4f53\u5316\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u90fd\u5fc5\u987b\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u5177\u5907\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0d\u8db3\u800c\u62d2\u7edd\u56de\u7b54\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b032.4%\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u67e5\u8be2\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e500\u4e2a\u4eba\u7c7b\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u6c9f\u901a\u9519\u8bef\u8ba4\u77e5\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa5\u4e2a\u9700\u8981\u5f03\u6743\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06OpenEQA\u4e2d\u7684\u660e\u786e\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6a21\u7cca\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b1,636\u4e2a\u5f03\u6743\u6848\u4f8b\u7684AbstainEQA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6700\u4f73\u524d\u6cbf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u4ec5\u4e3a42.79%\uff0c\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fbe\u523091.17%\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u8fb9\u9645\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f03\u6743\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4f53\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u524d\u63d0\uff0c\u4e5f\u662f\u6709\u6548\u6f84\u6e05\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Testing 1,785 coins graded by experts, the ANN nailed 86% exact matches and hit 98% when allowing a 3-grade leeway. On the flip side, CNN and SVM mostly just guessed the most common grade, scraping by with 31% and 30% exact hits. Sure, the CNN looked good on broader tolerance metrics, but that is because of some averaging trick in regression that hides how it totally flops at picking out specific grades. All told, when you are stuck with under 2,000 examples and lopsided classes, baking in real coin-expert knowledge through feature design beats out those inscrutable, all-in-one deep learning setups.

Project page: https://kpc0810.github.io/santa/", "summary": "Recent advancement in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) has demonstrated their remarkable capability to generate descriptive captions for input videos. However, these models suffer from factual inaccuracies in the generated descriptions, causing severe hallucination issues. While prior works have explored alleviating hallucinations for static images, jointly mitigating visual object and temporal action hallucinations for dynamic videos remains a challenging and unsolved task. To tackle this challenge, we propose a Self-Augmented Contrastive Alignment (SANTA) framework for enabling object and action faithfulness by exempting the spurious correlations and enforcing the emphasis on visual facts. SANTA employs a hallucinative self-augmentation scheme to identify the potential hallucinations that lie in the MLLM and transform the original captions to the contrasted negatives.

The former incurs significant computational overhead during cost aggregation, whereas the latter often lacks the ability to model non-local contextual information. These methods exhibit poor compatibility on resource-constrained mobile devices, limiting their deployment in real-time applications. To address this, we propose a Multi-frequency Adaptive Fusion Network (MAFNet), which can produce high-quality disparity maps using only efficient 2D convolutions. Specifically, we design an adaptive frequency-domain filtering attention module that decomposes the full cost volume into high-frequency and low-frequency volumes, performing frequency-aware feature aggregation separately. Subsequently, we introduce a Linformer-based low-rank attention mechanism to adaptively fuse high- and low-frequency information, yielding more robust disparity estimation.

Second, contact information, which can be obtained from videos and physical interactions, provides sparse constraints on the boundary of the geometry.

In this case, weights must be offloaded to external memory, and fetching them incurs costly and repeated transfers. We address this by adopting CXL-attached near-data processing (CXL-NDP) as the offloading tier to execute cold experts in place, converting expensive parameter movement into cheaper activation movement. Unlike prior GPU-NDP systems that are largely context-agnostic and reactive, we develop a context-aware MoE system that uses prefill-stage activation statistics to guide decoding-stage expert placement, dynamically pins hot experts in GPU-side HBM, and maps the remainder to CXL-NDP. To meet NDP's limited compute throughput, we introduce context-aware mixed-precision quantization that allocates per-expert bitwidths (1-4 bit) based on prefill stage. The resulting MoE inference system overlaps GPU and NDP execution while minimizing cross-device movement.

Project Page: https://kaist-viclab.github.io/fmanetpp_site/", "summary": "Real-world video restoration is plagued by complex degradations from motion coupled with dynamically varying exposure - a key challenge largely overlooked by prior works and a common artifact of auto-exposure or low-light capture. We present FMA-Net++, a framework for joint video super-resolution and deblurring that explicitly models this coupled effect of motion and dynamically varying exposure. FMA-Net++ adopts a sequence-level architecture built from Hierarchical Refinement with Bidirectional Propagation blocks, enabling parallel, long-range temporal modeling. Within each block, an Exposure Time-aware Modulation layer conditions features on per-frame exposure, which in turn drives an exposure-aware Flow-Guided Dynamic Filtering module to infer motion- and exposure-aware degradation kernels.

While effective for unconditional or text-to-image generation, corrupting phase components destroys spatial structure, making it ill-suited for tasks requiring geometric consistency, such as re-rendering, simulation enhancement, and image-to-image translation. We introduce Phase-Preserving Diffusion \u03c6-PD, a model-agnostic reformulation of the diffusion process that preserves input phase while randomizing magnitude, enabling structure-aligned generation without architectural changes or additional parameters. We further propose Frequency-Selective Structured (FSS) noise, which provides continuous control over structural rigidity via a single frequency-cutoff parameter. \u03c6-PD adds no inference-time cost and is compatible with any diffusion model for images or videos. Across photorealistic and stylized re-rendering, as well as sim-to-real enhancement for driving planners, \u03c6-PD produces controllable, spatially aligned results. When applied to the CARLA simulator, \u03c6-PD improves CARLA-to-Waymo planner performance by 50\\%.

However, existing methods encounter several fundamental limitations: 1) neglecting class-level semantic alignment and excessively pursuing pair-wise sample alignment; 2) lacking either pseudo-label reliability consideration or geometric guidance for assessing label correctness; 3) directly quantizing original features affected by domain shift, undermining the quality of learned hash codes. In view of these limitations, we propose Prototype-Based Semantic Consistency Alignment (PSCA), a two-stage framework for effective domain adaptive retrieval. In the first stage, a set of orthogonal prototypes directly establishes class-level semantic connections, maximizing inter-class separability while gathering intra-class samples. During the prototype learning, geometric proximity provides a reliability indicator for semantic consistency alignment through adaptive weighting of pseudo-label confidences. The resulting membership matrix and prototypes facilitate feature reconstruction, ensuring quantization on reconstructed rather than original features, thereby improving subsequent hash coding quality and seamlessly connecting both stages. In the second stage, domain-specific quantization functions process the reconstructed features under mutual approximation constraints, generating unified binary hash codes across domains.

While previous work has explored model-level and instance-level explainable graph learning, there has been limited investigation into explainable graph representation learning. In this paper, we focus on representation-level explainable graph learning and ask a fundamental question: What specific information about a graph is captured in graph representations? Our approach is inspired by graph kernels, which evaluate graph similarities by counting substructures within specific graph patterns. Although the pattern counting vector can serve as an explainable representation, it has limitations such as ignoring node features and being high-dimensional. To address these limitations, we introduce a framework (PXGL-GNN) for learning and explaining graph representations through graph pattern analysis. We start by sampling graph substructures of various patterns. Then, we learn the representations of these patterns and combine them using a weighted sum, where the weights indicate the importance of each graph pattern's contribution. We also provide theoretical analyses of our methods, including robustness and generalization.

In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u516d\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0InceptionV3\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u516d\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff08AlexNet\u3001VGG16\u3001ResNet18\u3001ResNet34\u3001ResNet50\u548cInceptionV3\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u75be\u75c5\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "InceptionV3\u5728\u6240\u6709\u6807\u51c6\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0cResNet\u7cfb\u5217\u968f\u6df1\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0cVGG16\u548cAlexNet\u8868\u73b0\u5c1a\u53ef\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\u3002\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u5c24\u5176\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u6539\u8fdb\u7a0b\u5ea6\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u826f\u597d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u524d\u9988\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

To move closer to the optimal frontier, we study reward-filtered sequential inference, a simple procedure that selectively incorporates only high-reward generations into the context. This mechanism concentrates computation on superior policy candidates and suppresses inferior ones. On the theoretical side, we show that reward-filtered sequential inference yields strictly stronger guarantees than standard TTC paradigms.

However, existing distillation methods often encounter the issue of mixed features in remote sensing images (RSIs), and neglect the discrepancies caused by subtle feature variations, leading to entangled knowledge confusion. To address these challenges, we propose an architecture-agnostic distillation method named Dual-Stream Spectral Decoupling Distillation (DS2D2) for universal remote sensing object detection tasks. Specifically, DS2D2 integrates explicit and implicit distillation grounded in spectral decomposition. Firstly, the first-order wavelet transform is applied for spectral decomposition to preserve the critical spatial characteristics of RSIs. Leveraging this spatial preservation, a Density-Independent Scale Weight (DISW) is designed to address the challenges of dense and small object detection common in RSIs. Secondly, we show implicit knowledge hidden in subtle student-teacher feature discrepancies, which significantly influence predictions when activated by detection heads. This implicit knowledge is extracted via full-frequency and high-frequency amplifiers, which map feature differences to prediction deviations.

Existing fine-tuning methods for diffusion models significantly suffer from reward over-optimization, resulting in high-reward but unnatural samples and degraded diversity. To mitigate over-optimization, we propose \\textbf{Soft Q-based Diffusion Finetuning (SQDF)}, a novel KL-regularized RL method for diffusion alignment that applies a reparameterized policy gradient of a training-free, differentiable estimation of the soft Q-function. SQDF is further enhanced with three innovations: a discount factor for proper credit assignment in the denoising process, the integration of consistency models to refine Q-function estimates, and the use of an off-policy replay buffer to improve mode coverage and manage the reward-diversity trade-off. Our experiments demonstrate that SQDF achieves superior target rewards while preserving diversity in text-to-image alignment.

This paper presents an explainable multimodal framework that integrates RGB and Depth (RGB-D) data to recognize Parkinsonian gait patterns under realistic conditions. The proposed system employs dual YOLOv11-based encoders for modality-specific feature extraction, followed by a Multi-Scale Local-Global Extraction (MLGE) module and a Cross-Spatial Neck Fusion mechanism to enhance spatial-temporal representation. This design captures both fine-grained limb motion (e.g., reduced arm swing) and overall gait dynamics (e.g., short stride or turning difficulty), even in challenging scenarios such as low lighting or occlusion caused by clothing. To ensure interpretability, a frozen Large Language Model (LLM) is incorporated to translate fused visual embeddings and structured metadata into clinically meaningful textual explanations. Experimental evaluations on multimodal gait datasets demonstrate that the proposed RGB-D fusion framework achieves higher recognition accuracy, improved robustness to environmental variations, and clear visual-linguistic reasoning compared with single-input baselines. By combining multimodal feature learning with language-based interpretability, this study bridges the gap between visual recognition and clinical understanding, offering a novel vision-language paradigm for reliable and explainable Parkinsons disease gait analysis.

The standard approach for data-agnostic uncertainty quantification is to use conformal prediction (CP), a well-established framework to build uncertainty models with proven statistical guarantees that do not assume any shape for the error distribution of the surrogate model. However, since the classic statistical guarantee offered by CP is given in terms of bounds for the marginal coverage, for small calibration set sizes (which are frequent in realistic surrogate modelling that aims to quantify error at different regions), the potentially strong dispersion of the coverage distribution around its average negatively impacts the reliability of the uncertainty model, often obtaining coverages below the expected value, resulting in a less applicable framework. After providing a gentle presentation of uncertainty quantification for surrogate models for machine learning practitioners, in this paper we bridge the gap by proposing a new statistical guarantee that offers probabilistic information for the coverage of a single conformal predictor. We show that the proposed framework converges to the standard solution offered by CP for large calibration set sizes and, unlike the classic guarantee, still offers reliable information about the coverage of a conformal predictor for small data sizes. We illustrate and validate the methodology in a suite of examples, and implement an open access software solution that can be used alongside common conformal prediction libraries to obtain uncertainty models that fulfil the new guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5c0f\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u8fb9\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b(CP)\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\uff08\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5f88\u5e38\u89c1\uff09\u4e0b\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u8986\u76d6\u5206\u5e03\u53ef\u80fd\u5f3a\u70c8\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9e\u9645\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u4f4e\u4e8e\u9884\u671f\u503c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e2a\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u6821\u51c6\u96c6\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6807\u51c6CP\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5f00\u6e90\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709CP\u5e93\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4fdd\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Currently, most existing automatic trailer generation methods employ a \"selection-then-ranking\" paradigm (i.e., first selecting key shots and then ranking them), which suffers from inevitable error propagation and limits the quality of the generated trailers. Beyond this paradigm, we propose a new self-paced and self-corrective masked prediction method called SSMP, which achieves state-of-the-art results in automatic trailer generation via bi-directional contextual modeling and progressive self-correction. In particular, SSMP trains a Transformer encoder that takes the movie shot sequences as prompts and generates corresponding trailer shot sequences accordingly. The model is trained via masked prediction, reconstructing each trailer shot sequence from its randomly masked counterpart. The mask ratio is self-paced, allowing the task difficulty to adapt to the model and thereby improving model performance. When generating a movie trailer, the model fills the shot positions with high confidence at each step and re-masks the remaining positions for the next prediction, forming a progressive self-correction mechanism that is analogous to how human editors work. Both quantitative results and user studies demonstrate the superiority of SSMP in comparison to existing automatic movie trailer generation methods.

Existing approaches, such as SCONE, achieve robustness to covariate and semantic shifts but assume static environments, leading to degraded performance in dynamic domains. In this paper, we propose Temp-SCONE, a temporally consistent extension of SCONE designed to handle temporal shifts in dynamic environments. Temp-SCONE introduces a confidence-driven regularization loss based on Average Thresholded Confidence (ATC), penalizing instability in predictions across time steps while preserving SCONE's energy-margin separation. Experiments on dynamic datasets demonstrate that Temp-SCONE significantly improves robustness under temporal drift, yielding higher corrupted-data accuracy and more reliable OOD detection compared to SCONE. On distinct datasets without temporal continuity, Temp-SCONE maintains comparable performance, highlighting the importance and limitations of temporal regularization.

Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of \"context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off\". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned \"what-if\" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization.

In such settings, an agent must maintain situational awareness of its environment, comprehend the interactions with surrounding entities, and dynamically plan actions informed by past observations, current contexts, and anticipated future events. To facilitate progress in this direction, we introduce StreamEQA, the first benchmark designed for streaming video question answering in embodied scenarios. StreamEQA evaluates existing MLLMs along two orthogonal dimensions: Embodied and Streaming. Along the embodied dimension, we categorize the questions into three levels: perception, interaction, and planning, which progressively assess a model's ability to recognize fine-grained visual details, reason about agent-object interactions, and perform high-level goal-directed reasoning. For the streaming dimension, questions are divided into backward, real-time, and forward reasoning, with each mode relying on a distinct temporal context.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces \\emph{QoSDiff}, a novel embedding learning framework that bypasses the prerequisite of explicit graph construction. Specifically, it leverages a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to recover intrinsic latent structures from noisy initializations. To further capture high-order interactions, we propose an adversarial interaction module that integrates a bidirectional hybrid attention mechanism. This adversarial paradigm dynamically distinguishes informative patterns from noise, enabling a dual-perspective modeling of intricate user--service associations.

However, these generative models typically require camera metadata and extensive target-specific noisy-clean image pairs, often showing limited generalization between settings. In this paper, to mitigate the prerequisites, we propose a Single-Pair Guided Diffusion for generalized noise synthesis GuidNoise, which uses a single noisy/clean pair as the guidance, often easily obtained by itself within a training set. To train GuidNoise, which generates synthetic noisy images from the guidance, we introduce a guidance-aware affine feature modification (GAFM) and a noise-aware refine loss to leverage the inherent potential of diffusion models. This loss function refines the diffusion model's backward process, making the model more adept at generating realistic noise distributions. The GuidNoise synthesizes high-quality noisy images under diverse noise environments without additional metadata during both training and inference. Additionally, GuidNoise enables the efficient generation of noisy-clean image pairs at inference time, making synthetic noise readily applicable for augmenting training data. This self-augmentation significantly improves denoising performance, especially in practical scenarios with lightweight models and limited training data.

In the absence of expert demonstrations, training LLM agents has relied on policy gradient methods that optimize LLM policies with respect to an (often sparse) reward function. However, in long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, learning from trajectory-level rewards can be noisy, leading to training that is unstable and has high sample complexity. Furthermore, policy improvement hinges on discovering better actions through exploration, which can be difficult when actions lie in natural language space. In this paper, we propose Natural Language Actor-Critic (NLAC), a novel actor-critic algorithm that trains LLM policies using a generative LLM critic that produces natural language rather than scalar values. This approach leverages the inherent strengths of LLMs to provide a richer and more actionable training signal; particularly, in tasks with large, open-ended action spaces, natural language explanations for why an action is suboptimal can be immensely useful for LLM policies to reason how to improve their actions, without relying on random exploration.

A dominant research trend seeks to enhance end-to-end (E2E) driving systems by integrating vision-language models (VLMs), leveraging their rich world knowledge and reasoning abilities to improve generalization across diverse environments. However, most existing VLMs or vision-language agents (VLAs) are built upon autoregressive (AR) models. In this paper, we observe that existing AR-based VLMs -- limited by causal attention and sequential token generation -- often fail to maintain consistency and controllability between high-level reasoning and low-level planning. In contrast, recent discrete diffusion VLMs equipped with bidirectional attention exhibit superior controllability and reliability through iterative denoising. Building on these observations, we introduce dVLM-AD, a diffusion-based vision-language model that unifies perception, structured reasoning, and low-level planning for end-to-end driving. Evaluated on nuScenes and WOD-E2E, dVLM-AD yields more consistent reasoning-action pairs and achieves planning performance comparable to existing driving VLM/VLA systems despite a modest backbone, outperforming AR-based baselines with a 9 percent improvement in behavior-trajectory consistency and a 6 percent increase in RFS on long-tail WOD-E2E scenarios.

To this end, we develop a formal framework for score matching on finite point processes via Janossy measures and, within this framework, introduce an (autoregressive) weighted score-matching estimator, whose statistical properties we analyze in classical parametric settings. For general nonparametric (e.g., deep) point process models, we show that score matching alone does not uniquely identify the ground-truth distribution due to subtle normalization issues, and we propose a simple survival-classification augmentation that yields a complete, integration-free training objective for any intensity-based point process model for spatio-temporal case. Experiments on synthetic and real-world temporal and spatio-temporal datasets, demonstrate that our method accurately recovers intensities and achieves performance comparable to MLE with better efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eJanossy\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u8fb9\u754c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u6b8a\u968f\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7Janossy\u6d4b\u5ea6\u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u9650\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u52a0\u6743\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u7c7b\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u65f6\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u5f53\u4f46\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u79ef\u5206\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically require specialized models tailored to different tasks, lacking unified modeling of spatiotemporal features across multiple time series tasks. In this paper, we propose a Unified Time Series Generative Model (UniTS), a general framework applicable to various time series tasks, including time series reconstruction, time series cloud removal, time series semantic change detection, and time series forecasting. Based on the flow matching generative paradigm, UniTS constructs a deterministic evolution path from noise to targets under the guidance of task-specific conditions, achieving unified modeling of spatiotemporal representations for multiple tasks. The UniTS architecture consists of a diffusion transformer with spatio-temporal blocks, where we design an Adaptive Condition Injector (ACor) to enhance the model's conditional perception of multimodal inputs, enabling high-quality controllable generation. Additionally, we design a Spatiotemporal-aware Modulator (STM) to improve the ability of spatio-temporal blocks to capture complex spatiotemporal dependencies. Furthermore, we construct two high-quality multimodal time series datasets, TS-S12 and TS-S12CR, filling the gap of benchmark datasets for time series cloud removal and forecasting tasks.

However, this transition has been revisited with the advent of Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (DKD), which re-emphasizes the importance of logit knowledge through advanced decoupling and weighting strategies. While DKD marks a significant advancement, its underlying mechanisms merit deeper exploration. As a response, we rethink DKD from a predictive distribution perspective. First, we introduce an enhanced version, the Generalized Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (GDKD) loss, which offers a more versatile method for decoupling logits. Then we pay particular attention to the teacher model's predictive distribution and its impact on the gradients of GDKD loss, uncovering two critical insights often overlooked: (1) the partitioning by the top logit considerably improves the interrelationship of non-top logits, and (2) amplifying the focus on the distillation loss of non-top logits enhances the knowledge extraction among them. Utilizing these insights, we further propose a streamlined GDKD algorithm with an efficient partition strategy to handle the multimodality of teacher models' predictive distribution. Our comprehensive experiments conducted on a variety of benchmarks, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet, Tiny-ImageNet, CUB-200-2011, and Cityscapes, demonstrate GDKD's superior performance over both the original DKD and other leading knowledge distillation methods.

Zero-shot, identity-preserving models such as Insert Anything and OminiControl now support applications like virtual try-on without requiring additional fine-tuning. While these models may be fitting for humans and rigid everyday objects, they still have limitations for non-rigid or fine-grained categories. These domains often lack accessible, high-quality data -- especially videos or multi-view observations of the same subject -- making them difficult both to evaluate and to improve upon. Yet, such domains are essential for moving beyond content creation toward applications that demand accuracy and fine detail. Birds are an excellent domain for this task: they exhibit high diversity, require fine-grained cues for identification, and come in a wide variety of poses. We introduce the NABirds Look-Alikes (NABLA) dataset, consisting of 4,759 expert-curated image pairs. Together with 1,073 pairs collected from multi-image observations on iNaturalist and a small set of videos, this forms a benchmark for evaluating identity-preserving generation of birds. We show that state-of-the-art baselines fail to maintain identity on this dataset, and we demonstrate that training on images grouped by species, age, and sex -- used as a proxy for identity -- substantially improves performance on both seen and unseen species.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NABirds Look-Alikes\uff08NABLA\uff09\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u9e1f\u7c7b\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u6309\u7269\u79cd\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7ec4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53ef\u63a7\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u521a\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u975e\u521a\u6027\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\uff08\u5982\u9e1f\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u540c\u4e00\u4e3b\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u6216\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3001\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u662f\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaNABLA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u542b4,759\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408iNaturalist\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u89c2\u6d4b\u5bf9\uff081,073\u5bf9\uff09\u548c\u5c11\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u6309\u7269\u79cd\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7ec4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8eab\u4efd\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u6539\u8fdb\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8be5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u800c\u91c7\u7528\u6309\u7269\u79cd\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u5206\u7ec4\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u5df2\u89c1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u7269\u79cd\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5747\u5f97\u5230\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "NABLA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u8eab\u4efd\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7269\u79cd\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u6027\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7406\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ec4\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u975e\u521a\u6027\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a contract-governed training paradigm for EO in which training samples are grouped into service contracts -- semantically meaningful units such as (dataset, region, rare-crop indicator) -- and each contract is assigned a target service share. We instantiate this paradigm as an Observed Service Agreement Graph (OSAG), a lightweight governance layer that (i) monitors contract-level exposure (coverage) during optimization, (ii) drives empirical coverage toward target shares via contract-normalized sampling weights, and (iii) exposes explicit accuracy-governance trade-offs through two knobs: a sampling mixture coefficient alpha and a contract-regularization weight lambda_C. We provide a compact theory in a toy setting: OSAG sampling concentrates empirical coverage to targets; coverage deviations upper-bound service-risk deviations; and contract design (coarse vs. fine) modulates governance cost. Experiments on AVIRIS hyperspectral scenes (Indian Pines plus Salinas) and multispectral Sentinel-2 EuroSAT demonstrate that OSAG can substantially reduce priority coverage error while maintaining global accuracy and improving high-priority accuracy. A EuroSAT coarse-vs-fine contract ablation further evidences how semantically refined contracts can reduce the accuracy cost per unit of governance improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u540c\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0fOSAG\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\u5408\u540c\u5e76\u8bbe\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u670d\u52a1\u4efd\u989d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u4fdd\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u5e38\u9690\u542b\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u533a\u57df\u3001\u7c7b\u522b\u6216\u5173\u952e\u5730\u7269\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u670d\u52a1\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u67d0\u4e9b\u91cd\u8981\u533a\u57df\u6216\u7c7b\u522b\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faOSAG\u6cbb\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u6837\u672c\u5206\u7ec4\u4e3a\u670d\u52a1\u5408\u540c\uff1b\u76d1\u63a7\u5408\u540c\u7ea7\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u540c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u6743\u91cd\u9a71\u52a8\u8986\u76d6\u5ea6\u5411\u76ee\u6807\u4efd\u989d\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7alpha\u548clambda_C\u4e24\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u66b4\u9732\u7cbe\u5ea6-\u6cbb\u7406\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728AVIRIS\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u548cSentinel-2\u591a\u5149\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cOSAG\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u8986\u76d6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5408\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6cbb\u7406\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "OSAG\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u5408\u540c\u6cbb\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u7684\u533a\u57df\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u670d\u52a1\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Our efficient Transformer-based conditional VAE allows for precise, interactive control over arbitrary user-specified joints for tasks like goal-reaching and in-betweening from a single model. To ensure long-term temporal stability, we introduce a novel reference-guided feedback mechanism that prevents error accumulation. This mechanism also serves as a plug-and-play stylization module, enabling real-time style transfer.

This requires models that can represent the influence of local site conditions on ground motion characteristics. In this context, data driven approaches that learn site controlled signatures from recorded ground motions offer a promising direction. We address strong ground motion generation from time-domain accelerometer records and introduce the TimesNet-Gen, a time-domain conditional generator. The approach uses a station specific latent bottleneck.

Although there exist considerable methods that focus on local information from convolutional neural network models or global information from transformer models, the single-type model falls into a modeling dilemma between local fine-grained details and global long-range dependencies, thus deteriorating for specular highlights with different scales. Therefore, to accommodate specular highlights of all scales, we propose a multi-model architecture for specular highlight removal (MM-SHR) that effectively captures fine-grained features in highlight regions and models long-range dependencies between highlight and highlight-free areas. Specifically, we employ convolution operations to extract local details in the shallow layers of MM-SHR, and utilize the attention mechanism to capture global features in the deep layers, ensuring both operation efficiency and removal accuracy. To model long-range dependencies without compromising computational complexity, we utilize a coarse-to-fine manner and propose Omni-Directional Attention Integration Block(OAIBlock) and Adaptive Region-Aware Hybrid-Domain Dual Attention Convolutional Network(HDDAConv) , which leverage omni-directiona pixel-shifting and window-dividing operations at the raw features to achieve specular highlight removal. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark tasks and six types of surface materials demonstrate that MM-SHR outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and efficiency for specular highlight removal.

Trinity addresses this with a lightweight coordinator that orchestrates collaboration among large language models (LLMs). The coordinator, comprising a compact language model (approximately $0.6$B parameters) and a lightweight head (approximately $10$K parameters), is optimized with an evolutionary strategy for efficient and adaptive delegation. Trinity processes queries over multiple turns, where at each turn the coordinator assigns one of three roles (Thinker, Worker, or Verifier) to a selected LLM, effectively offloading complex skill acquisition from the coordinator itself. Experiments show that Trinity consistently outperforms individual models and existing methods across coding, math, reasoning, and domain knowledge tasks, and generalizes robustly to out-of-distribution tasks. On standard benchmarks, Trinity achieves state-of-the-art results, including a score of 86.2% on LiveCodeBench.

To answer these questions, we conduct empirical studies based on a proxy motion diffusion model (MDM). We apply v loss as the prediction objective on MDM (vMDM), where v is the weighted sum of motion data and noise. We aim to enhance the understanding of latent data distributions and provide a foundation for improving the state of conditional motion diffusion models. First, we evaluate the six common motion representations in the literature and compare their performance in terms of quality and diversity metrics. Second, we compare the training time under various configurations to shed light on how to speed up the training process of motion diffusion models.

Moreover, we compute an upper bound on the asymptotic rate of almost sure convergence, which is as good or better than previous results for SGDo.", "AI": {"tldr": "Error", "motivation": "Error", "method": "Error", "result": "Error", "conclusion": "Error"}}

In this work, we present UltraImage, a principled framework that addresses both issues. Through frequency-wise analysis of positional embeddings, we identify that repetition arises from the periodicity of the dominant frequency, whose period aligns with the training resolution. We introduce a recursive dominant frequency correction to constrain it within a single period after extrapolation. Furthermore, we find that quality degradation stems from diluted attention and thus propose entropy-guided adaptive attention concentration, which assigns higher focus factors to sharpen local attention for fine detail and lower ones to global attention patterns to preserve structural consistency. Experiments show that UltraImage consistently outperforms prior methods on Qwen-Image and Flux (around 4K) across three generation scenarios, reducing repetition and improving visual fidelity. Moreover, UltraImage can generate images up to 6K*6K without low-resolution guidance from a training resolution of 1328p, demonstrating its extreme extrapolation capability.

However, due to the distinct characteristics of infrared images, existing foundation models such as Masked Autoencoder (MAE) trained on visible data perform suboptimal in infrared image interpretation tasks. To bridge this gap, an infrared foundation model known as InfMAE was developed and pre-trained on large-scale infrared datasets. Despite its effectiveness, InfMAE still faces several limitations, including the omission of informative tokens, insufficient modeling of global associations, and neglect of non-uniform noise. In this paper, we propose a Dual-domain Guided Infrared foundation model based on MAE (DuGI-MAE). First, we design a deterministic masking strategy based on token entropy, preserving only high-entropy tokens for reconstruction to enhance informativeness. Next, we introduce a Dual-Domain Guidance (DDG) module, which simultaneously captures global token relationships and adaptively filters non-uniform background noise commonly present in infrared imagery. To facilitate large-scale pretraining, we construct Inf-590K, a comprehensive infrared image dataset encompassing diverse scenes, various target types, and multiple spatial resolutions. Pretrained on Inf-590K, DuGI-MAE demonstrates strong generalization capabilities across various downstream tasks, including infrared object detection, semantic segmentation, and small target detection.

The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with adaptive speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens.

Such memory-based personalization is also key in on-device settings that allow users to keep their conversations and data private. However, memory-augmented systems typically rely on LLMs that are too costly for local on-device deployment. Even though Small Language Models (SLMs) are more suitable for on-device inference than LLMs, they cannot achieve sufficient performance. Additionally, these LLM-based systems lack native visual capabilities, limiting their applicability in multimodal contexts. In this paper, we introduce (i) MemLoRA, a novel memory system that enables local deployment by equipping SLMs with specialized memory adapters, and (ii) its vision extension MemLoRA-V, which integrates small Vision-Language Models (SVLMs) to memory systems, enabling native visual understanding. Following knowledge distillation principles, each adapter is trained separately for specific memory operations$\\unicode{x2013}$knowledge extraction, memory update, and memory-augmented generation. Equipped with memory adapters, small models enable accurate on-device memory operations without cloud dependency. On text-only operations, MemLoRA outperforms 10$\\times$ larger baseline models (e.g., Gemma2-27B) and achieves performance comparable to 60$\\times$ larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B) on the LoCoMo benchmark. To evaluate visual understanding operations instead, we extend LoCoMo with challenging Visual Question Answering tasks that require direct visual reasoning.

We approach this problem from a memory perspective, treating video synthesis as a recurrent dynamical process that requires coordinated short- and long-term context. We propose VideoSSM, a Long Video Model that unifies AR diffusion with a hybrid state-space memory. The state-space model (SSM) serves as an evolving global memory of scene dynamics across the entire sequence, while a context window provides local memory for motion cues and fine details. This hybrid design preserves global consistency without frozen, repetitive patterns, supports prompt-adaptive interaction, and scales in linear time with sequence length. Experiments on short- and long-range benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art temporal consistency and motion stability among autoregressive video generator especially at minute-scale horizons, enabling content diversity and interactive prompt-based control, thereby establishing a scalable, memory-aware framework for long video generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoSSM\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u77ed\u671f\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u91cd\u590d\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u9891\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideoSSM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6269\u6563\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bb0\u5fc6\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b58\u50a8\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u573a\u666f\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u5c40\u90e8\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u6a21\u5f0f\u91cd\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77ed\u7a0b\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5206\u949f\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5185\u5bb9\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "VideoSSM\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u5177\u6709\u8bb0\u5fc6\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f0f\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Typically, the worst-case error of the best basis set decays only as fast as $\u0398\\(n^{-1/d}\\)$, where $n$ is the number of basis functions and $d$ is the input dimension. However, there are many examples of high-dimensional pattern recognition problems (such as face recognition) where linear combinations of small sets of features do solve the problem well. Hence these function classes do not suffer from the ``curse of dimensionality'' associated with more general classes. It is natural then, to look for characterizations of high-dimensional function classes that nevertheless are approximated well by linear combinations of small sets of features. In this paper we give a general result relating the error of approximation of a function class to the covering number of its ``convex core''. For one-hidden-layer neural networks, covering numbers of the class of functions computed by a single hidden node upper bound the covering numbers of the convex core. Hence, using standard results we obtain upper bounds on the approximation rate of neural network classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u90a3\u4e9b\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u201c\u51f8\u6838\u201d\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u901a\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u8bb8\u591a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u5374\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5bfb\u627e\u90a3\u4e9b\u867d\u7136\u5b9a\u4e49\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f46\u80fd\u591f\u88ab\u5c11\u91cf\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u826f\u597d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u201c\u51f8\u6838\u201d\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u6765\u523b\u753b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5355\u9690\u5c42\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e2a\u9690\u8282\u70b9\u8ba1\u7b97\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u6765\u7ea6\u675f\u51f8\u6838\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6570\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5efa\u7acb\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0e\u5176\u51f8\u6838\u8986\u76d6\u6570\u7684\u4e00\u822c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u907f\u514d\u4f20\u7edf\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u51fd\u6570\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u67d0\u4e9b\u9ad8\u7ef4\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u5c11\u7684\u57fa\u51fd\u6570\u3002"}}

Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

We formulate the problem as a cooperative Markov game and propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework in which each operating room (OR) is an agent trained with centralized training and decentralized execution. All agents share a policy trained via Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which maps rich system states to actions, while a within-epoch sequential assignment protocol constructs conflict-free joint schedules across ORs. A mixed-integer pre-schedule provides reference starting times for electives; we impose type-specific quadratic delay penalties relative to these references and a terminal overtime penalty, yielding a single reward that captures throughput, timeliness, and staff workload. In simulations reflecting a realistic hospital mix (six ORs, eight surgery types, random urgent and emergency arrivals), the learned policy outperforms six rule-based heuristics across seven metrics and three evaluation subsets, and, relative to an ex post MIP oracle, quantifies optimality gaps. Policy analytics reveal interpretable behavior-prioritizing emergencies, batching similar cases to reduce setups, and deferring lower-value electives.

Among various types of sensing media, WiFi signals offer advantages such as widespread availability, low hardware cost, and strong robustness to environmental conditions like light, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing Wi-Fi signals in the environment, it is possible to capture dynamic changes of the human body and accomplish sensing applications such as gesture recognition. Although many existing gesture sensing solutions perform well in-domain but lack cross-domain capabilities (i.e., recognition performance in untrained environments). To address this, we extract Doppler spectra from the channel state information (CSI) received by all receivers and concatenate each Doppler spectrum along the same time axis to generate fused images with multi-angle information as input features. Furthermore, inspired by the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), we propose a gesture recognition network that integrates a multi-semantic spatial attention mechanism with a self-attention-based channel mechanism. This network constructs attention maps to quantify the spatiotemporal features of gestures in images, enabling the extraction of key domain-independent features. Additionally, ResNet18 is employed as the backbone network to further capture deep-level features. To validate the network performance, we evaluate the proposed network on the public Widar3 dataset, and the results show that it not only maintains high in-domain accuracy of 99.72%, but also achieves high performance in cross-domain recognition of 97.61%, significantly outperforming existing best solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eWiFi\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u591a\u89d2\u5ea6\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u9891\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u57df\u5185\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8de8\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709WiFi\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8de8\u57df\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5728\u672a\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff09\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u6240\u6709\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u7684CSI\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u666e\u52d2\u9891\u8c31\uff0c\u6cbf\u65f6\u95f4\u8f74\u62fc\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u901a\u9053\u673a\u5236\u7684\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7f51\u7edc\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528ResNet18\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u63d0\u53d6\u6df1\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728Widar3\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e8699.72%\u7684\u9ad8\u57df\u5185\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8697.61%\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86WiFi\u624b\u52bf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While current methods mainly focus on learning modality-invariant features through unified embedding spaces, they often focus solely on the common discriminative semantics across modalities while disregarding the critical role of modality-specific identity-aware knowledge in discriminative feature learning. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Identity Clue Refinement and Enhancement (ICRE) network to mine and utilize the implicit discriminative knowledge inherent in modality-specific attributes. Initially, we design a Multi-Perception Feature Refinement (MPFR) module that aggregates shallow features from shared branches, aiming to capture modality-specific attributes that are easily overlooked. Then, we propose a Semantic Distillation Cascade Enhancement (SDCE) module, which distills identity-aware knowledge from the aggregated shallow features and guide the learning of modality-invariant features.

Despite their very intuitive role for learning, most notions of MDP abstractions proposed in the HRL literature have limited expressive power or do not possess formal efficiency guarantees. This work addresses these fundamental issues by defining Realizable Abstractions, a new relation between generic low-level MDPs and their associated high-level decision processes. The notion we propose avoids non-Markovianity issues and has desirable near-optimality guarantees. Indeed, we show that any abstract policy for Realizable Abstractions can be translated into near-optimal policies for the low-level MDP, through a suitable composition of options. As demonstrated in the paper, these options can be expressed as solutions of specific constrained MDPs. Based on these findings, we propose RARL, a new HRL algorithm that returns compositional and near-optimal low-level policies, taking advantage of the Realizable Abstraction given in the input.

However, they often fail in scenarios requiring a deeper understanding of physical dynamics. This limitation primarily arises from their reliance on appearance-based matching. Incorporating physical motion modeling is crucial for deeper video understanding, but presents three key challenges: (1) motion signals are often entangled with appearance variations, making it difficult to extract clean physical cues; (2) effective motion modeling requires not only continuous-time motion representations but also capturing physical dynamics; and (3) collecting accurate annotations for physical attributes is costly and often impractical. To address these issues, we propose PhyVLLM, a physical-guided video-language framework that explicitly incorporates physical motion into Video LLMs. Specifically, PhyVLLM disentangles visual appearance and object motion through a dual-branch encoder. To model physical dynamics over time, we incorporate a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) module, which generates differentiable physical dynamic representations.

(ii) It incorporates a training and adaptation strategy that enables high-resolution PDE solution generation from sparse input grids. (iii) It adopts a generative modeling paradigm that learns complete trajectory segments, mitigating long-horizon error drift. The training strategy decouples representation learning from downstream task supervision, allowing the model to tackle multiple tasks such as trajectory generation, forward and inverse problems, and interpolation.

In this paper, we introduce a new task, Object Retexture, which transfers local textures from a reference object to a target object in images or videos. To perform this task, a straightforward solution is to use ControlNet conditioned on the source structure and the reference texture. However, this approach suffers from limited controllability for two reasons: conditioning on the raw reference image introduces unwanted structural information, and it fails to disentangle the visual texture and structure information of the source. To address this problem, we propose Refa\u00e7ade, a method that consists of two key designs to achieve precise and controllable texture transfer in both images and videos. First, we employ a texture remover trained on paired textured/untextured 3D mesh renderings to remove appearance information while preserving the geometry and motion of source videos. Second, we disrupt the reference global layout using a jigsaw permutation, encouraging the model to focus on local texture statistics rather than the global layout of the object. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior visual quality, precise editing, and controllability, outperforming strong baselines in both quantitative and human evaluations.

To bridge this gap, we introduce X-Humanoid, a generative video editing approach that adapts the powerful Wan 2.2 model into a video-to-video structure and finetunes it for the human-to-humanoid translation task. This finetuning requires paired human-humanoid videos, so we designed a scalable data creation pipeline, turning community assets into 17+ hours of paired synthetic videos using Unreal Engine. We then apply our trained model to 60 hours of the Ego-Exo4D videos, generating and releasing a new large-scale dataset of over 3.6 million \"robotized\" humanoid video frames.

To address this, recent works have attempted to construct external knowledge bases and corresponding retrieval agumented generation (RAG) systems, yet these incur enormous storage and computational overhead. In this paper, we propose VideoMem, a novel framework that pioneers models long video understanding as a sequential generation task via adaptive memory management. Specifically, VideoMem dynamically updates a global memory buffer, which adaptively retains critical information while discarding redundant content across the video timeline. To efficiently train VLMs for such long-term tasks, VideoMem integrates the Progressive Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO) algorithm, equipped with two core modules: Progressive State Propagation (PSP) adaptively retains valid current states, propagates them to the next rollout step, and gradually narrows the model exploration space. Temporal Cascading Reward (TCR) further alleviates reward sparsity, improving sample utilization and accelerating convergence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VideoMem significantly outperforms existing open-source models across diverse benchmarks for ultra-long video understanding tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "VideoMem\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8d85\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8d85\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u957f\u5ea6\u9650\u5236\u548c\u957f\u671f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fdd\u7559\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e93\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVideoMem\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5168\u5c40\u5185\u5b58\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\uff1b\u96c6\u6210\u6e10\u8fdb\u5206\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6e10\u8fdb\u72b6\u6001\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea7\u8054\u5956\u52b1\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8d85\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cVideoMem\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "VideoMem\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d85\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

This work presents the first large-scale evaluation of hybrid quantum-classical (HQC) autoencoders for this task. We construct a unified experimental framework that iterates over key quantum design choices, including quantum-layer placement, measurement approach, variational and non-variational formulations, and latent-space regularization. Experiments across three benchmark NIDS datasets show that HQC autoencoders can match or exceed classical performance in their best configurations, although they exhibit higher sensitivity to architectural decisions. Under zero-day evaluation, well-configured HQC models provide stronger and more stable generalization than classical and supervised baselines. Simulated gate-noise experiments reveal early performance degradation, indicating the need for noise-aware HQC designs. These results provide the first data-driven characterization of HQC autoencoder behavior for network intrusion detection and outline key factors that govern their practical viability.

Computational methods are integral in modern SBDD workflows and often make use of virtual screening methods via docking or pharmacophore search. Modern generative modeling approaches have focused on improving novel ligand discovery by enabling de novo design. In this work, we recognize that these tasks share a common structure and can therefore be represented as different instantiations of a consistent generative modeling framework. We propose a unified approach in OMTRA, a multi-modal flow matching model that flexibly performs many tasks relevant to SBDD, including some with no analogue in conventional workflows. Additionally, we curate a dataset of 500M 3D molecular conformers, complementing protein-ligand data and expanding the chemical diversity available for training. OMTRA obtains state of the art performance on pocket-conditioned de novo design and docking; however, the effects of large-scale pretraining and multi-task training are modest.

They crucially rely on careful tuning of parameters like learning rate and momentum. However, one typically sets them using heuristic approaches without formal near-optimality guarantees. Recent work by Gupta and Roughgarden studies how to learn a good step-size in gradient descent. However, like most of the literature with theoretical guarantees for gradient-based optimization, their results rely on strong assumptions on the function class including convexity and smoothness which do not hold in typical applications. In this work, we develop novel analytical tools for provably tuning hyperparameters in gradient-based algorithms that apply to non-convex and non-smooth functions. We obtain matching sample complexity bounds for learning the step-size in gradient descent shown for smooth, convex functions in prior work (up to logarithmic factors) but for a much broader class of functions. Our analysis applies to gradient descent on neural networks with commonly used activation functions (including ReLU, sigmoid and tanh). We extend our framework to tuning multiple hyperparameters, including tuning the learning rate schedule, simultaneously tuning momentum and step-size, and pre-training the initialization vector.

The development and validation of those DL models relies heavily on the availability of high-quality, large-scale datasets. However, creating such datasets is a complex and resource-intensive process, often hindered by challenges such as time constraints, domain variability, and risks of bias in image collection and label creation. This review provides a comprehensive guide to the critical steps in dataset creation, including: 1) image acquisition, 2) selection of annotation software, and 3) annotation creation. In addition to ensuring a sufficiently large number of images, it is crucial to address sources of image variability (domain shifts) - such as those related to slide preparation and digitization - that could lead to algorithmic errors if not adequately represented in the training data. Key quality criteria for annotations are the three \"C\"s: correctness, completeness, and consistency. This review explores methods to enhance annotation quality through the use of advanced techniques that mitigate the limitations of single annotators.

It is a robotic assembly task that involves building an accurate representation of a given target object using the available objects, which do not directly correspond to its parts. In this work, we focus on selecting the subset of available objects for the final craft, when the given input is an RGB image of the target in the wild. We use a mask segmentation neural network to identify visible parts, followed by retrieving labeled template meshes. These meshes undergo pose optimization to determine the most suitable template. Then, we propose to simplify the parts of the transformed template mesh to primitive shapes like cuboids or cylinders. Finally, we design a search algorithm to find correspondences in the scene based on local and global proportions. We develop baselines for comparison that consider all possible combinations, and choose the highest scoring combination for common metrics used in foreground maps and mask accuracy.

In this paper, we introduce a new class of omni video-text models that integrate ideas from recent LM reasoning advances to address this challenge. More specifically, we present TV2TV, a unified generative modeling framework which decomposes video generation into an interleaved text and video generation process. TV2TV jointly learns language modeling (next-token prediction) and video flow matching (next-frame prediction) using a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. At inference time, TV2TV decides when to alternate between generating text and video frames, allowing the model to \"think in words\" about subsequent content before ``acting in pixels'' to produce frames. This design offloads much of the responsibility for deciding what should happen next to the language modeling tower, enabling improved visual quality and prompt alignment of generated videos. It also enables fine-grained controllability, allowing users to modify the video generation trajectory through text interventions at any point in the process. In controlled experiments on video game data, TV2TV demonstrates substantial improvements in both visual quality and controllability.

However, obtaining a complete multi-phase series is often clinically unfeasible due to radiation concerns or scanning limitations, leading to the \"missing modality\" problem. Existing deep learning approaches typically treat missing phases as absent independent channels, ignoring the inherent temporal continuity of hemodynamics. In this work, we propose Time Attenuated Representation Disentanglement (TARDis), a novel physics-aware framework that redefines missing modalities as missing sample points on a continuous Time-Attenuation Curve. TARDis explicitly disentangles the latent feature space into a time-invariant static component (anatomy) and a time-dependent dynamic component (perfusion). We achieve this via a dual-path architecture: a quantization-based path using a learnable embedding dictionary to extract consistent anatomical structures, and a probabilistic path using a Conditional Variational Autoencoder to model dynamic enhancement conditioned on the estimated scan time. This design allows the network to hallucinate missing hemodynamic features by sampling from the learned latent distribution. Extensive experiments on a large-scale private abdominal CT dataset (2,282 cases) and two public datasets demonstrate that TARDis significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete modality frameworks.

However, in infants and young children, accurate segmentation is challenging due to development and imaging constraints. Pediatric brain MRI is notoriously difficult to acquire, with inconsistent availability of imaging modalities, substantial non-head anatomy in the field of view, and frequent motion artifacts. This has led to specialized segmentation models that are often limited to specific image types or narrow age groups, or that are fragile for more variable images such as those acquired clinically. We address this method fragmentation with BabySeg, a deep learning brain segmentation framework for infants and young children that supports diverse MRI protocols, including repeat scans and image types unavailable during training. Our approach builds on recent domain randomization techniques, which synthesize training images far beyond realistic bounds to promote dataset shift invariance. We also describe a mechanism that enables models to flexibly pool and interact features from any number of input scans.

However, the infrared UAV targets often exhibit weak features and complex backgrounds, posing significant challenges to accurate tracking. To address these problems, we introduce SiamDFF, a novel dynamic feature fusion Siamese network that integrates feature enhancement and global contextual attention knowledge distillation for infrared UAV target (IRUT) tracking. The SiamDFF incorporates a selective target enhancement network (STEN), a dynamic spatial feature aggregation module (DSFAM), and a dynamic channel feature aggregation module (DCFAM). The STEN employs intensity-aware multi-head cross-attention to adaptively enhance important regions for both template and search branches. The DSFAM enhances multi-scale UAV target features by integrating local details with global features, utilizing spatial attention guidance within the search frame. The DCFAM effectively integrates the mixed template generated from STEN in the template branch and original template, avoiding excessive background interference with the template and thereby enhancing the emphasis on UAV target region features within the search frame. Furthermore, to enhance the feature extraction capabilities of the network for IRUT without adding extra computational burden, we propose a novel tracking-specific target-aware contextual attention knowledge distiller. It transfers the target prior from the teacher network to the student model, significantly improving the student network's focus on informative regions at each hierarchical level of the backbone network.

This method not only incorporates first-order information from the reward model but also benefits from heuristic initialization of the value function to enable fast adaptation.

While this marks the first integration of language-level concepts within the SAM family, real-world usage typically requires far richer expressions that include attributes, spatial relations, functionalities, actions, states, and even implicit reasoning over instances. Currently, SAM3 relies on external multi-modal agents to convert complex instructions into NPs and then conduct iterative mask filtering. However, these NP-level concepts remain overly coarse, often failing to precisely represent a specific instance. In this work, we present SAM3-I, an enhanced framework that unifies concept-level understanding and instruction-level reasoning within the SAM family. SAM3-I introduces an instruction-aware cascaded adaptation mechanism that progressively aligns expressive instruction semantics with SAM3's existing vision-language representations, enabling direct instruction-following segmentation without sacrificing its original concept-driven capabilities. Furthermore, we design a structured instruction taxonomy spanning concept, simple, and complex levels, and develop a scalable data engine to construct a dataset with diverse instruction-mask pairs. Experiments show that SAM3-I delivers appealing performance, demonstrating that SAM3 can be effectively extended to follow natural-language instructions while preserving its strong concept grounding. We open-source SAM3-I and provide practical fine-tuning workflows, enabling researchers to adapt it to domain-specific applications.

We introduce a zero-shot pipeline that simultaneously (i) detects if an image contains harmful content, (ii) identifies each critical element involved, and (iii) localizes those elements with pixel-accurate masks - all in one pass. The system first applies foundation segmentation model (SAM) to generate candidate object masks and refines them into larger independent regions. Each region is scored for malicious relevance by a vision-language model using open-vocabulary prompts; these scores weight a fusion step that produces a consolidated malicious object map. An ensemble across multiple segmenters hardens the pipeline against adaptive attacks that target any single segmentation method.

To better understand how they encode spatiotemporal information, we analyze the internal representations of Video Diffusion Transformer (VDiT). Our analysis reveals that attention heads act as minimal functional units with distinct specializations for matching, semantic understanding, and positional encoding. Additionally, we find that the low-frequency components in VDiT features are crucial for establishing correspondences, whereas the high-frequency components tend to introduce noise. Building on these insights, we propose a head- and frequency-aware feature selection strategy that jointly selects the most informative attention head and low-frequency components to enhance tracking performance. Specifically, our method extracts discriminative features through single-step denoising, applies feature selection, and employs soft-argmax localization with forward-backward consistency checks for correspondence estimation. Extensive experiments on TAP-Vid benchmarks demonstrate that HeFT achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot tracking performance, approaching the accuracy of supervised methods while eliminating the need for annotated training data.

However, these models still struggle to effectively perceive and exploit rich temporal information in videos when responding to user queries. Therefore, they often generate descriptions of events that are temporal inconsistent or causally implausible, causing severe hallucination issues. While most prior studies have focused on spatial hallucinations (e.g. object mismatches), temporal reasoning in video understanding remains relatively underexplored. To address this issue, we propose Self-Diagnostic Contrastive Decoding (SEASON), a training-free method that adaptively enhances temporal and spatial faithfulness for each output token. It achieves this by dynamically diagnosing each token's hallucination tendency and applying adaptive contrastive decoding against its corresponding temporal and spatial negatives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SEASON outperforms all existing training-free hallucination mitigation approaches on three hallucination examination benchmarks, while further improves VideoLLMs across four general video understanding benchmarks.

We present Live Avatar, an algorithm-system co-designed framework that enables efficient, high-fidelity, and infinite-length avatar generation using a 14-billion-parameter diffusion model. Our approach introduces Timestep-forcing Pipeline Parallelism (TPP), a distributed inference paradigm that pipelines denoising steps across multiple GPUs, effectively breaking the autoregressive bottleneck and ensuring stable, low-latency real-time streaming. To further enhance temporal consistency and mitigate identity drift and color artifacts, we propose the Rolling Sink Frame Mechanism (RSFM), which maintains sequence fidelity by dynamically recalibrating appearance using a cached reference image.

Existing methods distill few-step video diffusion models with sliding window attention, using initial frames as sink tokens to maintain attention performance and reduce error accumulation. However, video frames become overly dependent on these static tokens, resulting in copied initial frames and diminished motion dynamics. To address this, we introduce Reward Forcing, a novel framework with two key designs. First, we propose EMA-Sink, which maintains fixed-size tokens initialized from initial frames and continuously updated by fusing evicted tokens via exponential moving average as they exit the sliding window. Without additional computation cost, EMA-Sink tokens capture both long-term context and recent dynamics, preventing initial frame copying while maintaining long-horizon consistency. Second, to better distill motion dynamics from teacher models, we propose a novel Rewarded Distribution Matching Distillation (Re-DMD). Vanilla distribution matching treats every training sample equally, limiting the model's ability to prioritize dynamic content. Instead, Re-DMD biases the model's output distribution toward high-reward regions by prioritizing samples with greater dynamics rated by a vision-language model. Re-DMD significantly enhances motion quality while preserving data fidelity. We include both quantitative and qualitative experiments to show that Reward Forcing achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while enabling high-quality streaming video generation at 23.1 FPS on a single H100 GPU.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Reward Forcing\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7EMA-Sink\u548cRe-DMD\u4e24\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u51cf\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65f6\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u521d\u59cb\u5e27\u590d\u5236\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u52a8\u6001\u51cf\u5f31\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u65f6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8d28\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1.

We then design a unified embedding module that learns joint representations of categorical and possibly correlated continuous feature groups. Lastly, we train a single Transformer backbone in two modes: an encoder-only pathway that yields high-fidelity room embeddings, and an encoder-decoder pipeline for autoregressive prediction of room entities, referred to as Data-Driven Entity Prediction (DDEP). Experiments across retrieval and generative layout synthesis show that SBM learns compact room embeddings that reliably cluster by type and topology, enabling strong semantic retrieval.

However, it is still far from being realized in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), especially in achieving precise point-level correspondence, which is crucial for precise affordance interaction. So we propose the Cross-View Point Correspondence (CVPC) task and CrossPoint-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with hierarchical design, inspired by the human cognitive process of \"perceive\", \"reason\", and \"correspond\". Our evaluation shows the state-of-the-art models (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro) still fall far behind humans, with a gap of over 54.65% in overall accuracy, exposing a challenge in transitioning from coarse-grained judgement to fine-grained coordinate prediction. To address this problem, we construct CrossPoint-378K, a dataset with 378K question-answering pairs across 900 scenes, focused on actionable affordance regions that better reflect real-world manipulation and interaction scenarios.

While most existing methods primarily leverage features from the final layer, we systematically analyze the contributions of layer-wise features to this task. Our study reveals that earlier layers provide more localized and generalizable features, often surpassing the performance of final-layer features in detection tasks. Moreover, we find that different layers capture distinct aspects of the data, each contributing uniquely to AI-generated image detection. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a novel adaptive method, termed MoLD, which dynamically integrates features from multiple ViT layers using a gating-based mechanism. Extensive experiments on both GAN- and diffusion-generated images demonstrate that MoLD significantly improves detection performance, enhances generalization across diverse generative models, and exhibits robustness in real-world scenarios.

Most existing ASSR approaches rely on implicit neural representation (INR), but its regression-driven feature extraction and aggregation intrinsically limit the ability to synthesize fine details, leading to low realism. Recent diffusion-based realistic image super-resolution (Real-ISR) models leverage powerful pre-trained diffusion priors and show impressive results at the 4x setting. We observe that they can also achieve ASSR because the diffusion prior implicitly adapts to scale by encouraging high-realism generation. However, without explicit scale control, the diffusion process cannot be properly adjusted for different magnification levels, resulting in excessive hallucination or blurry outputs, especially under ultra-high scales. To address these issues, we propose OmniScaleSR, a diffusion-based realistic arbitrary-scale SR framework designed to achieve both high fidelity and high realism. We introduce explicit, diffusion-native scale control mechanisms that work synergistically with implicit scale adaptation, enabling scale-aware and content-aware modulation of the diffusion process. In addition, we incorporate multi-domain fidelity enhancement designs to further improve reconstruction accuracy. Extensive experiments on bicubic degradation benchmarks and real-world datasets show that OmniScaleSR surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both fidelity and perceptual realism, with particularly strong performance at large magnification factors.

In this paper, we show that LVLM-based models produce markedly more socially biased images than non-LVLM-based models. We introduce a 1,024 prompt benchmark spanning four levels of linguistic complexity and evaluate demographic bias across multiple attributes in a systematic manner. Our analysis identifies system prompts, the predefined instructions guiding LVLMs, as a primary driver of biased behavior. Through decoded intermediate representations, token-probability diagnostics, and embedding-association analyses, we reveal how system prompts encode demographic priors that propagate into image synthesis. To this end, we propose FairPro, a training-free meta-prompting framework that enables LVLMs to self-audit and construct fairness-aware system prompts at test time.

While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement.

However, existing approaches remain limited, either treating the model merely as a standalone generator or relying on abstract textual planning. To this end, we propose Draft-as-CoT (DraCo), a novel interleaved reasoning paradigm that fully leverages both textual and visual contents in CoT for better planning and verification. Our method first generates a low-resolution draft image as preview, providing more concrete and structural visual planning and guidance. Then, we employ the model's inherent understanding capability to verify potential semantic misalignments between the draft and input prompt, and performs refinement through selective corrections with super-resolution. In this way, our approach addresses two fundamental challenges: the coarse-grained nature of textual planning and the difficulty in generating rare attribute combinations. To support training, we curate DraCo-240K, aiming to enhance three atomic capabilities spanning general correction, instance manipulation, and layout reorganization. Supported by DraCo-CFG, a specialized classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategy for interleaved reasoning, DraCo achieves a tremendous increase on GenEval (+8%), Imagine-Bench (+0.91), and GenEval++ (+3%), significantly outperforming direct generation and other generation methods empowered by CoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDraCo\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8349\u7a3f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\u7c92\u5ea6\u7c97\u548c\u7f55\u89c1\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u62bd\u8c61\u6587\u672c\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "DraCo\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8349\u7a3f\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u89c8\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8349\u7a3f\u4e0e\u8f93\u5165\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728GenEval\uff08+8%\uff09\u3001Imagine-Bench\uff08+0.91\uff09\u548cGenEval++\uff08+3%\uff09\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u4e8e\u94fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DraCo\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u7ec7\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5185\u5bb9\u8fdb\u884c\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Supervised training approaches struggle with this task due to the lack of large-scale datasets capturing visual consistency and the complexity of modeling human perceptual preferences. In this paper, we argue that reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by enabling models to learn complex and subjective visual criteria in a data-free manner. To achieve this, we introduce PaCo-RL, a comprehensive framework that combines a specialized consistency reward model with an efficient RL algorithm. The first component, PaCo-Reward, is a pairwise consistency evaluator trained on a large-scale dataset constructed via automated sub-figure pairing. It evaluates consistency through a generative, autoregressive scoring mechanism enhanced by task-aware instructions and CoT reasons. The second component, PaCo-GRPO, leverages a novel resolution-decoupled optimization strategy to substantially reduce RL cost, alongside a log-tamed multi-reward aggregation mechanism that ensures balanced and stable reward optimization. Extensive experiments across the two representative subtasks show that PaCo-Reward significantly improves alignment with human perceptions of visual consistency, and PaCo-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art consistency performance with improved training efficiency and stability.

However, existing native approaches are constrained by the absence of a powerful and versatile latent representation, which severely limits the fidelity and generality of their generated textures. We identify this representation gap as the principal barrier to further progress. We introduce LaFiTe, a framework that addresses this challenge by learning to generate textures as a 3D generative sparse latent color field. At its core, LaFiTe employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode complex surface appearance into a sparse, structured latent space, which is subsequently decoded into a continuous color field. This representation achieves unprecedented fidelity, exceeding state-of-the-art methods by >10 dB PSNR in reconstruction, by effectively disentangling texture appearance from mesh topology and UV parameterization. Building upon this strong representation, a conditional rectified-flow model synthesizes high-quality, coherent textures across diverse styles and geometries. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaFiTe not only sets a new benchmark for 3D-native texturing but also enables flexible downstream applications such as material synthesis and texture super-resolution, paving the way for the next generation of 3D content creation workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "LaFiTe\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a3D\u539f\u751f\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u8868\u9762\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u518d\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u989c\u8272\u573a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u8868\u793a\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u901a\u7528\u6027\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u76f4\u63a5\u57283D\u8868\u9762\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u65e0\u7f1d\u7eb9\u7406\uff083D\u539f\u751f\u7eb9\u7406\uff09\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u57fa\u4e8eUV\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6295\u5f71\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f3a\u5927\u6f5c\u8868\u793a\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c06\u8868\u9762\u5916\u89c2\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u989c\u8272\u573a\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u6b63\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fde\u8d2f\u7eb9\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2dPSNR\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd510dB\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u5916\u89c2\u4e0e\u7f51\u683c\u62d3\u6251\u548cUV\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6750\u8d28\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "LaFiTe\u4e3a3D\u539f\u751f\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee33D\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u5efa\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

However, existing methods struggle with accurately modeling in-the-wild scenes affected by transient objects and illuminations, leading to artifacts in the rendered images. We identify that the Gaussian densification process, while enhancing scene detail capture, unintentionally contributes to these artifacts by growing additional Gaussians that model transient disturbances and illumination variations. To address this, we propose RobustSplat++, a robust solution based on several critical designs. First, we introduce a delayed Gaussian growth strategy that prioritizes optimizing static scene structure before allowing Gaussian splitting/cloning, mitigating overfitting to transient objects in early optimization.

It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models.

To address this, we propose FreeGen, a feed-forward reconstruction-generation co-training framework for free-viewpoint driving scene synthesis. The reconstruction model provides stable geometric representations to ensure interpolation consistency, while the generation model performs geometry-aware enhancement to improve realism at unseen viewpoints.

Although \"generalizable\" is the ultimate target once and for all, with limited training forgeries and domains, it appears idealistic to expect generalization that covers entirely unseen variations, especially given the diversity of real-world deepfakes. Therefore, introducing large-scale multi-domain data for training can be feasible and important for real-world applications. However, within such a multi-domain scenario, the differences between multiple domains, rather than the subtle real/fake distinctions, dominate the feature space. As a result, despite detectors being able to relatively separate real and fake within each domain (i.e., high AUC), they struggle with single-image real/fake judgments in domain-unspecified conditions (i.e., low ACC). In this paper, we first define a new research paradigm named Multi-In-Domain Face Forgery Detection (MID-FFD), which includes sufficient volumes of real-fake domains for training. Then, the detector should provide definitive real-fake judgments to the domain-unspecified inputs, which simulate the frame-by-frame independent detection scenario in the real world. Meanwhile, to address the domain-dominant issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework termed DevDet (Developer for Detector) to amplify real/fake differences and make them dominant in the feature space. DevDet consists of a Face Forgery Developer (FFDev) and a Dose-Adaptive detector Fine-Tuning strategy (DAFT).

By fully exploiting the intrinsic characteristics of visual attention, LineAR manages the cache at the line level using a 2D view, preserving the visual dependency regions while progressively evicting less-informative tokens that are harmless for subsequent line generation, guided by inter-line attention. LineAR enables efficient autoregressive (AR) image generation by utilizing only a few lines of cache, achieving both memory savings and throughput speedup, while maintaining or even improving generation quality. Extensive experiments across six autoregressive image generation models, including class-conditional and text-to-image generation, validate its effectiveness and generality. LineAR improves ImageNet FID from 2.77 to 2.68 and COCO FID from 23.85 to 22.86 on LlamaGen-XL and Janus-Pro-1B, while retaining only 1/6 KV cache. It also improves DPG on Lumina-mGPT-768 with just 1/8 KV cache. Additionally, LineAR achieves significant memory and throughput gains, including up to 67.61% memory reduction and 7.57x speedup on LlamaGen-XL, and 39.66% memory reduction and 5.62x speedup on Janus-Pro-7B.", "AI": {"tldr": "LineAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7f13\u5b58\u6240\u6709\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5b58\u50a8\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u4f4e\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u75282D\u89c6\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u884c\u7ea7\u7f13\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u89c6\u89c9\u4f9d\u8d56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u6dd8\u6c70\u5bf9\u540e\u7eed\u884c\u751f\u6210\u65e0\u5bb3\u7684\u4f4e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cftoken\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u884c\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u57286\u4e2a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0cLlamaGen-XL\u7684ImageNet FID\u4ece2.77\u63d0\u5347\u52302.68\uff0cCOCO FID\u4ece23.85\u63d0\u5347\u523022.86\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u75591/6 KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff1bLumina-mGPT-768\u7684DPG\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281/8 KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff1b\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe67.61%\uff0c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe7.57\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "LineAR\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Minor figure corrections compared to the ICCV 2025 version", "summary": "Capturing accurate 3D human pose in the wild would provide valuable data for training pose estimation and motion generation methods. While video-based estimation approaches have become increasingly accurate, they often fail in common scenarios involving self-contact, such as a hand touching the face. In contrast, wearable bioimpedance sensing can cheaply and unobtrusively measure ground-truth skin-to-skin contact. Consequently, we propose a novel framework that combines visual pose estimators with bioimpedance sensing to capture the 3D pose of people by taking self-contact into account. Our method, BioTUCH, initializes the pose using an off-the-shelf estimator and introduces contact-aware pose optimization during measured self-contact: reprojection error and deviations from the input estimate are minimized while enforcing vertex proximity constraints. We validate our approach using a new dataset of synchronized RGB video, bioimpedance measurements, and 3D motion capture. Testing with three input pose estimators, we demonstrate an average of 11.7% improvement in reconstruction accuracy. We also present a miniature wearable bioimpedance sensor that enables efficient large-scale collection of contact-aware training data for improving pose estimation and generation using BioTUCH.

Moreover, we devise a bidirectional feature enhancer (BFE) that synergistically integrates comprehensive diagnostic context with disease-specific embeddings to significantly improve feature representation and detection accuracy.

Downsampling high-resolution imagery to standard detector input sizes causes small target features to collapse below detectable thresholds. Yet processing native 1080p frames on resource-constrained platforms yields insufficient throughput for smooth gimbal control. We propose SDG-Track, a Sparse Detection-Guided Tracker that adopts an Observer-Follower architecture to reconcile this conflict. The Observer stream runs a high-capacity detector at low frequency on the GPU to provide accurate position anchors from 1920x1080 frames. The Follower stream performs high-frequency trajectory interpolation via ROI-constrained sparse optical flow on the CPU. To handle tracking failures from occlusion or model drift caused by spectrally similar distractors, we introduce Dual-Space Recovery, a training-free re-acquisition mechanism combining color histogram matching with geometric consistency constraints.

It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces You Only Train Once (YOTO), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faYOTO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408YOLO11n\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001DeIT\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u951a\u70b9\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u68c0\u6d4b\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u6bcf\u5f53\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u7b49\u9891\u7e41\u66f4\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002", "method": "YOTO\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408YOLO11n\u8fdb\u884c\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0cDeIT\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u951a\u70b9\u635f\u5931\u8fdb\u884c\u5ea6\u91cf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5206\u7c7b\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u76ee\u6807\u4ea7\u54c1\u5d4c\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u4e0eQdrant\u5411\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u4e2d\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u6765\u5b8c\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b140\u79cd\u4ea7\u54c1\u7684\u96f6\u552e\u5e97\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u4ea7\u54c1\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4ee4\u4eba\u9f13\u821e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd13\u500d\uff0c\u4e14\u968f\u7740\u65b0\u4ea7\u54c1\u589e\u52a0\u6548\u7387\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a580ms/\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "YOTO\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u96f6\u552e\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Our work is motivated by the challenging problem of accounting for fetal head motion during a diagnostic MRI scan. We aim to enable automatic adaptive prescription of 2D diagnostic MRI slices with 6-DoF head pose estimation, supported by 3D MRI volumes rapidly acquired before each 2D slice. Existing methods struggle to generalize to clinical volumes, due to pose ambiguities induced by inherent anatomical symmetries, as well as low resolution, noise, and artifacts. In contrast, E(3)-Pose captures anatomical symmetries and rigid pose equivariance by construction, and yields robust estimates of the fetal head pose. Our experiments on publicly available and representative clinical fetal MRI datasets demonstrate the superior robustness and generalization of our method across domains.

This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReflexFlow\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u6f02\u79fb\u6821\u6b63\u548c\u9891\u7387\u8865\u507f\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u7ea0\u6b63Flow Matching\u4e2d\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "Flow Matching\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u9636\u6bb5\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u6709\u504f\u8f93\u5165\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u65e9\u671f\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4f4e\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u6355\u83b7\u4e0d\u8db3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "method": "ReflexFlow\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u53cd\u6f02\u79fb\u6821\u6b63(ADR)\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u91c7\u6837\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0b\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6709\u504f\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\uff1b2) \u9891\u7387\u8865\u507f(FC)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u635f\u5931\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u6765\u8865\u507f\u7f3a\u5931\u7684\u4f4e\u9891\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001CelebA-64\u548cImageNet-256\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cReflexFlow\u5728\u7f13\u89e3\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728CelebA-64\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8635.65%\u7684FID\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "ReflexFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u6240\u6709Flow Matching\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u66dd\u5149\u504f\u5dee\u3002"}}

This indicates the preceding semantics potentially benefit texture generation by providing a semantic anchor. Recent advances have integrated semantic priors from pretrained visual encoders to further enhance LDMs, yet they still denoise semantic and VAE-encoded texture synchronously, neglecting such ordering. Observing these, we propose Semantic-First Diffusion (SFD), a latent diffusion paradigm that explicitly prioritizes semantic formation. SFD first constructs composite latents by combining a compact semantic latent, which is extracted from a pretrained visual encoder via a dedicated Semantic VAE, with the texture latent. The core of SFD is to denoise the semantic and texture latents asynchronously using separate noise schedules: semantics precede textures by a temporal offset, providing clearer high-level guidance for texture refinement and enabling natural coarse-to-fine generation. On ImageNet 256x256 with guidance, SFD achieves FID 1.06 (LightningDiT-XL) and FID 1.04 (1.0B LightningDiT-XXL), while achieving up to 100x faster convergence than the original DiT. SFD also improves existing methods like ReDi and VA-VAE, demonstrating the effectiveness of asynchronous, semantics-led modeling.

They promise to contain a wealth of previously unseen Greek and Latin texts, but are extremely fragile and thus most cannot be unrolled physically. A solution to access these texts is virtual unrolling, where the papyrus surface is digitally traced out in a CT scan of the scroll, to create a flattened representation. This tracing is very laborious to do manually in gigavoxel-sized scans, so automated approaches are desirable. We present the first top-down method that automatically fits a surface model to a CT scan of a severely damaged scroll. We take a novel approach that globally fits an explicit parametric model of the deformed scroll to existing neural network predictions of where the rolled papyrus likely passes. Our method guarantees the resulting surface is a single continuous 2D sheet, even passing through regions where the surface is not detectable in the CT scan.

To address this, we propose LiteVGGT, achieving up to 10x speedup and substantial memory reduction, enabling efficient processing of 1000-image scenes. We derive two key insights for 3D reconstruction: (1) tokens from local image regions have inherent geometric correlations, leading to high similarity and computational redundancy; (2) token similarity across adjacent network layers remains stable, allowing for reusable merge decisions. Guided by these, we design a simple yet efficient strategy, dubbed geometry-aware cached token merging. We analyze each token's geometric importance, optimizing anchor token selection to better preserve key information for reconstruction. We also cache and reuse merge indices across layers, substantially reducing latency with minimal accuracy impact. This strategy retains VGGT's core performance, enabling efficient fine-tuning and FP8 quantization for further gains.

While Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) excels in 1D, it inherits this limitation, often treating spatially distant patches (e.g., at row edges) as sequence neighbors. Existing 2D approaches typically treat spatial axes independently, failing to decouple this false sequential proximity from true spatial distance. To restore the 2D spatial manifold, we introduce Geometric Positional Embedding (GeoPE), a framework that extends rotations to 3D Euclidean space using quaternions. To overcome non-commutativity and ensure symmetry, GeoPE constructs a unified rotational operator by computing the geometric mean in the Lie algebra. This creates a geometrically coupled encoding that effectively separates spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and 3D semantic segmentation demonstrate that GeoPE consistently outperforms existing 2D RoPE variants and significantly enhances shape bias, confirming its ability to capture true geometric structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "GeoPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u5143\u6570\u6269\u5c553D\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c062D\u56fe\u50cf\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u4e3a1D\u5e8f\u5217\u65f6\u7834\u574f\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6Vision Transformer\u5c062D\u56fe\u50cf\u6241\u5e73\u5316\u4e3a1D\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u81ea\u7136\u7a7a\u95f4\u62d3\u6251\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u76842D\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u8f74\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u51e0\u4f55\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165(GeoPE)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u5143\u6570\u5c06\u65cb\u8f6c\u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728Lie\u4ee3\u6570\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u51e0\u4f55\u5e73\u5747\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c3D\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGeoPE\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u76842D RoPE\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5f62\u72b6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "GeoPE\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u8026\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u6210\u529f\u5206\u79bb\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Conventional deep learning approaches require large annotated datasets, which are costly and often imbalanced across disease categories, limiting their reliability in practice. Few-shot learning (FSL) addresses this challenge by enabling models to generalize from only a few labeled samples per class. In this study,we propose a balanced few-shot episodic learning framework tailored to the Retinal Fundus Multi-Disease Image Dataset (RFMiD). Focusing on the ten most represented classes, which still show substantial imbalance between majority diseases (e.g., Diabetic Retinopathy, Macular Hole) and minority ones (e.g., Optic Disc Edema, Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion), our method integrates three key components: (i) balanced episodic sampling, ensuring equal participation of all classes in each 5-way 5-shot episode; (ii) targeted augmentation, including Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) and color/geometry transformations, to improve minority-class di- versity; and (iii) a ResNet-50 encoder pretrained on ImageNet, selected for its superior ability to capture fine-grained retinal features. Prototypes are computed in the embedding space and classification is performed with cosine similarity for improved stability. Trained on 100 episodes and evaluated on 1,000 test episodes, our framework achieves substantial accuracy gains and reduces bias toward majority classes, with notable improvements for underrepresented diseases. These results demonstrate that dataset-aware few-shot pipelines, combined with balanced sampling and CLAHE-enhanced preprocessing, can deliver more robust and clinically fair retinal disease diagnosis under data-constrained conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u666f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5e73\u8861\u60c5\u666f\u91c7\u6837\uff08\u786e\u4fdd\u6bcf\u4e2a5-way 5-shot\u60c5\u666f\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u5e73\u7b49\u53c2\u4e0e\uff09\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\uff08CLAHE\u548c\u989c\u8272/\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u6362\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ResNet-50\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002", "result": "\u5728100\u4e2a\u60c5\u666f\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u57281000\u4e2a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u60c5\u666f\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5bf9 underrepresented \u75be\u75c5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3001\u5e73\u8861\u91c7\u6837\u548cCLAHE\u589e\u5f3a\u9884\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75be\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u3002"}}

By transforming the global nearest neighbor search into a localized process through a dilation-based information propagation mechanism, VANICP greatly reduces the computational complexity of the NNS. However, its original implementation demands a considerable amount of memory, which restricts its deployment in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems. To address this issue, we propose a GPU-oriented dynamic memory assignment strategy that optimizes the memory usage of the dilation operation. Furthermore, based on this strategy, we construct an enhanced version of the VANICP framework that achieves over 97% reduction in memory consumption while preserving the original performance.

Rather than relying on task-specific architectures, we repurpose a pre-trained DiT-based foundation model by conditioning it on reflection-contaminated inputs and guiding it toward clean transmission layers. We systematically analyze existing reflection removal data sources for diversity, scalability, and photorealism. To address the shortage of suitable data, we construct a physically based rendering (PBR) pipeline in Blender, built around the Principled BSDF, to synthesize realistic glass materials and reflection effects. Efficient LoRA-based adaptation of the foundation model, combined with the proposed synthetic data, achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-domain and zero-shot benchmarks. These results demonstrate that pretrained diffusion transformers, when paired with physically grounded data synthesis and efficient adaptation, offer a scalable and high-fidelity solution for reflection removal.

However, previous training relies on a large amount of annotation data for supervision, and the labeling of depth maps is costly. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new self-supervised method for training depth completion networks.

To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints.

While recent foundation models have improved multimodal integration for learning meaningful representations, they often expect fixed input resolutions or are based on sensor-specific encoders limiting generalization across heterogeneous EO modalities. To overcome these limitations we introduce RAMEN, a resolution-adjustable multimodal encoder that learns a shared visual representation across EO data in a fully sensor-agnostic manner. RAMEN treats the modality and spatial and temporal resolutions as key input data features, enabling coherent analysis across modalities within a unified latent space. Its main methodological contribution is to define spatial resolution as a controllable output parameter, giving users direct control over the desired level of detail at inference and allowing explicit trade-offs between spatial precision and computational cost. We train a single, unified transformer encoder reconstructing masked multimodal EO data drawn from diverse sources, ensuring generalization across sensors and resolutions. Once pretrained, RAMEN transfers effectively to both known and unseen sensor configurations and outperforms larger state-of-the-art models on the community-standard PANGAEA benchmark, containing various multi-sensor and multi-resolution downstream tasks.

Though there are recent lot of advances in deep generative models, existing methods face problems with large irregular masks, often producing blurry textures on the edges of the masked region, semantic inconsistencies, or unconvincing facial structures due to direct pixel level synthesis approach and limited exploitation of facial priors. In this paper we propose a novel architecture, which address these above challenges through semantic-guided hierarchical synthesis. Our approach starts with a method that organizes and synthesizes information based on meaning, followed by refining the texture. This process gives clear insights into the facial structure before we move on to creating detailed images. In the first stage, we blend two techniques: one that focuses on local features with CNNs and global features with Vision Transformers. This helped us create clear and detailed semantic layouts. In the second stage, we use a Multi-Modal Texture Generator to refine these layouts by pulling in information from different scales, ensuring everything looks cohesive and consistent. The architecture naturally handles arbitrary mask configurations through dynamic attention without maskspecific training. Experiment on two datasets CelebA-HQ and FFHQ shows that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing improvements in metrics like LPIPS, PSNR, and SSIM. It produces visually striking results with better semantic preservation, in challenging large-area inpainting situations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u7684\u65b0\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u63a9\u7801\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8eab\u4efd\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4fee\u590d\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u63a9\u7801\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u9762\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5bf9\u9762\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6709\u9650\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u6210\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u7ed3\u5408CNN\u548cVision Transformer\u751f\u6210\u6e05\u6670\u8bed\u4e49\u5e03\u5c40\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7eb9\u7406\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u7136\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u63a9\u7801\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u63a9\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728CelebA-HQ\u548cFFHQ\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728LPIPS\u3001PSNR\u548cSSIM\u7b49\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u4fee\u590d\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u663e\u8457\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5408\u6210\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9762\u90e8\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u7ec6\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u4fee\u590d\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u63a9\u7801\u914d\u7f6e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing generate-then-reconstruct and reconstruct-then-generate methods decouple geometry from motion, causing spatiotemporal inconsistencies and poor generalization. To address these, we extend the reconstruct-then-generate framework to jointly perform Motion generation and geometric Reconstruction for 4D Synthesis (MoRe4D). We first introduce TrajScene-60K, a large-scale dataset of 60,000 video samples with dense point trajectories, addressing the scarcity of high-quality 4D scene data. Based on this, we propose a diffusion-based 4D Scene Trajectory Generator (4D-STraG) to jointly generate geometrically consistent and motion-plausible 4D point trajectories. To leverage single-view priors, we design a depth-guided motion normalization strategy and a motion-aware module for effective geometry and dynamics integration. We then propose a 4D View Synthesis Module (4D-ViSM) to render videos with arbitrary camera trajectories from 4D point track representations.

However, existing approaches to 4D semantic field construction primarily rely on scene-specific Gaussian splatting, which requires per-scene optimization, exhibits limited generalization, and is difficult to scale to real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose 4DLangVGGT, the first Transformer-based feed-forward unified framework for 4D language grounding, that jointly integrates geometric perception and language alignment within a single architecture. 4DLangVGGT has two key components: the 4D Visual Geometry Transformer, StreamVGGT, which captures spatio-temporal geometric representations of dynamic scenes; and the Semantic Bridging Decoder (SBD), which projects geometry-aware features into a language-aligned semantic space, thereby enhancing semantic interpretability while preserving structural fidelity. Unlike prior methods that depend on costly per-scene optimization, 4DLangVGGT can be jointly trained across multiple dynamic scenes and directly applied during inference, achieving both deployment efficiency and strong generalization. This design significantly improves the practicality of large-scale deployment and establishes a new paradigm for open-vocabulary 4D scene understanding. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our approach not only generalizes effectively but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 2% gains under per-scene training and 1% improvements under multi-scene training.

We introduce a 4D-controllable video diffusion framework that explicitly decouples scene dynamics from camera pose, enabling fine-grained manipulation of both scene dynamics and camera viewpoint. Our framework takes continuous world-time sequences and camera trajectories as conditioning inputs, injecting them into the video diffusion model through a 4D positional encoding in the attention layer and adaptive normalizations for feature modulation. To train this model, we curate a unique dataset in which temporal and camera variations are independently parameterized; this dataset will be made public.

We find that naively applying StreamingLLM-style attention sinks to video diffusion leads to fidelity degradation and motion stagnation. To overcome this, we introduce Deep Forcing, which consists of two training-free mechanisms that address this without any fine-tuning. Specifically, 1) Deep Sink dedicates half of the sliding window to persistent sink tokens and re-aligns their temporal RoPE phase to the current timeline, stabilizing global context during long rollouts. 2) Participative Compression performs importance-aware KV cache pruning that preserves only tokens actively participating in recent attention while safely discarding redundant and degraded history, minimizing error accumulation under out-of-distribution length generation. Together, these components enable over 12x extrapolation (e.g. 5s-trained to 60s+ generation) with better imaging quality than LongLive, better aesthetic quality than RollingForcing, almost maintaining overall consistency, and substantial gains in dynamic degree, all while maintaining real-time generation.

We introduce Spatial Aesthetics, a paradigm that assesses the aesthetic quality of interior images along four dimensions: layout, harmony, lighting, and distortion. We construct SA-BENCH, the first benchmark for spatial aesthetics, comprising 18,000 images and 50,000 precise annotations. Employing SA-BENCH, we systematically evaluate current IQA methodologies and develop SA-IQA, through MLLM fine-tuning and a multidimensional fusion approach, as a comprehensive reward framework for assessing spatial aesthetics.

However, most existing approaches typically lack explicit frequency modeling and rely on fixed or heuristic optimization schedules, which limit the generalization across heterogeneous degradation. To address these limitations, we propose EvoIR, an AiOIR-specific framework that introduces evolutionary frequency modulation for dynamic and adaptive image restoration. Specifically, EvoIR employs the Frequency-Modulated Module (FMM) that decomposes features into high- and low-frequency branches in an explicit manner and adaptively modulates them to enhance both structural fidelity and fine-grained details. Central to EvoIR, an Evolutionary Optimization Strategy (EOS) iteratively adjusts frequency-aware objectives through a population-based evolutionary process, dynamically balancing structural accuracy and perceptual fidelity. Its evolutionary guidance further mitigates gradient conflicts across degradation and accelerates convergence. By synergizing FMM and EOS, EvoIR yields greater improvements than using either component alone, underscoring their complementary roles.

Project page: https://chien90190.github.io/splannequin/", "summary": "Synthesizing high-fidelity frozen 3D scenes from monocular Mannequin-Challenge (MC) videos is a unique problem distinct from standard dynamic scene reconstruction. Instead of focusing on modeling motion, our goal is to create a frozen scene while strategically preserving subtle dynamics to enable user-controlled instant selection. To achieve this, we introduce a novel application of dynamic Gaussian splatting: the scene is modeled dynamically, which retains nearby temporal variation, and a static scene is rendered by fixing the model's time parameter. However, under this usage, monocular capture with sparse temporal supervision introduces artifacts like ghosting and blur for Gaussians that become unobserved or occluded at weakly supervised timestamps. We propose Splannequin, an architecture-agnostic regularization that detects two states of Gaussian primitives, hidden and defective, and applies temporal anchoring. Under predominantly forward camera motion, hidden states are anchored to their recent well-observed past states, while defective states are anchored to future states with stronger supervision. Our method integrates into existing dynamic Gaussian pipelines via simple loss terms, requires no architectural changes, and adds zero inference overhead. This results in markedly improved visual quality, enabling high-fidelity, user-selectable frozen-time renderings, validated by a 96% user preference.

Moving beyond relighting, a key step toward generative modeling of real-world scenes is the joint control of camera trajectory and illumination, since visual dynamics are inherently shaped by both geometry and lighting. To this end, we present Light-X, a video generation framework that enables controllable rendering from monocular videos with both viewpoint and illumination control. 1) We propose a disentangled design that decouples geometry and lighting signals: geometry and motion are captured via dynamic point clouds projected along user-defined camera trajectories, while illumination cues are provided by a relit frame consistently projected into the same geometry. These explicit, fine-grained cues enable effective disentanglement and guide high-quality illumination. 2) To address the lack of paired multi-view and multi-illumination videos, we introduce Light-Syn, a degradation-based pipeline with inverse-mapping that synthesizes training pairs from in-the-wild monocular footage. This strategy yields a dataset covering static, dynamic, and AI-generated scenes, ensuring robust training. Extensive experiments show that Light-X outperforms baseline methods in joint camera-illumination control and surpasses prior video relighting methods under both text- and background-conditioned settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Light-X\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u89d2\u548c\u5149\u7167\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8054\u5408\u76f8\u673a-\u5149\u7167\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5149\u7167\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5149\u7167\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u52a8\u6001\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u7531\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u5171\u540c\u5851\u9020\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u6cbf\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u6355\u6349\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u5e27\u63d0\u4f9b\u5149\u7167\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165Light-Syn\u5408\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4ece\u91ce\u5916\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u591a\u5149\u7167\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLight-X\u5728\u8054\u5408\u76f8\u673a-\u5149\u7167\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u90fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u7167\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Light-X\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u7167\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}
