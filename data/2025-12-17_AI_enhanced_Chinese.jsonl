While earlier works emphasize highly diverse predictions, they often generate unrealistic human motions. More recent methods focus on accuracy and real-time performance, yet there remains potential to improve prediction quality further without exceeding time budgets. Additionally, current research on stochastic human motion prediction in HRC typically considers human motion in isolation, neglecting the influence of robot motion on human behavior. To address these research gaps and enable real-time, realistic, and interaction-aware human motion prediction, we propose a novel prediction-refinement framework that integrates both human and robot observed motion to refine the initial predictions produced by a pretrained state-of-the-art predictor. The refinement module employs a Flow Matching structure to account for uncertainty. Experimental studies on the HRC desktop disassembly dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves prediction accuracy while preserving the uncertainties and multi-modalities of human motion. Moreover, the total inference time of the proposed framework remains within the time budget, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b-\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u968f\u673a\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8fd0\u52a8\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e0d\u8d85\u51fa\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u6d4b-\u7cbe\u70bc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u4eba\u7c7b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Flow Matching\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728HRC\u684c\u9762\u62c6\u5378\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u603b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u9884\u7b97\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u4e14\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, field inspection with robots still depends on human teleoperation and manual reporting, which are labor-intensive. This paper aims to connect what a robot sees during autonomous navigation to the safety rules that are common in construction sites, automatically generating a safety inspection report. To this end, we proposed a multi-layer framework with two main modules: robotics and AI. On the robotics side, SLAM and autonomous navigation provide repeatable coverage and targeted revisits via waypoints. On AI side, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based layer produces scene descriptions; a retrieval component powered grounds those descriptions in OSHA and site policies; Another VLM-based layer assesses the safety situation based on rules; and finally Large Language Model (LLM) layer generates safety reports based on previous outputs. The framework is validated with a proof-of-concept implementation and evaluated in a lab environment that simulates common hazards across three scenarios. Results show high recall with competitive precision compared to state-of-the-art closed-source models.

This paper investigates how a robot's task performance and its expressive responses after outcomes shape the dynamics of human trust over time. To this end, we designed a controlled within-subjects study with two construction-inspired tasks, Material Delivery (physical assistance) and Information Gathering (perceptual assistance), and measured trust repeatedly (four times per task) using the 14-item Trust Perception Scale for HRI plus a redelegation choice. The robot produced two multimodal expressions, a \"glad\" display with a brief confirmation after success, and a \"sad\" display with an apology and a request for a second chance after failure. The study was conducted in a lab environment with 30 participants and a quadruped platform, and we evaluated trust dynamics and repair across both tasks. Results show that robot success reliably increases trust, failure causes sharp drops, and apology-based expressions partially restores trust (44% recovery in Material Delivery; 38% in Information Gathering). Item-level analysis indicates that recovered trust was driven mostly by interaction and communication factors, with competence recovering partially and autonomy aspects changing least. Additionally, age group and prior attitudes moderated trust dynamics with younger participants showed larger but shorter-lived changes, mid-20s participants exhibited the most durable repair, and older participants showed most conservative dynamics.

Given the initial guess and pairs of images and LiDAR point clouds, CLAIM utilizes a coarse-to-fine searching method to find the optimal transformation minimizing a patched Pearson correlation-based structure loss and a mutual information-based texture loss.

In this paper, we first introduce CMER-Bench, a carefully constructed benchmark that categorizes expressions into three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and complex. Leveraging CMER-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing MER models and general-purpose multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The results reveal that while current methods perform well on easy and moderate expressions, their performance degrades significantly when handling complex mathematical expressions, mainly because existing public training datasets are primarily composed of simple samples. In response, we propose MER-17M and CMER-3M that are large-scale datasets emphasizing the recognition of complex mathematical expressions. The datasets provide rich and diverse samples to support the development of accurate and robust complex MER models. Furthermore, to address the challenges posed by the complicated spatial layout of complex expressions, we introduce a novel expression tokenizer, and a new representation called Structured Mathematical Language, which explicitly models the hierarchical and spatial structure of expressions beyond LaTeX format. Based on these, we propose a specialized model named CMERNet, built upon an encoder-decoder architecture and trained on CMER-3M.

The goal is to understand both task performance and the practical effort needed to deploy each approach on real jobs. The authors developed two teleoperation interfaces to control the robots and collect the demonstrations needed, both of which proved effective for training robots for long-horizon and dexterous tasks. In addition, the authors conduct a three-stage evaluation. First, the authors compare a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) policy with a Deep Q-network (DQN) imitation model to identify the stronger RL baseline, focusing on model performance, generalization, and a pick-up experiment. Second, three different VLA models are trained in two different scenarios and compared with each other. Third, the authors benchmark the selected RL baseline against the VLA model using computational and sample-efficiency measures and then a robot experiment on a multi-stage panel installation task that includes transport and installation. The VLA model demonstrates strong generalization and few-shot capability, achieving 60% and 100% success in the pickup phase. In comparison, DQN can be made robust but needs additional noise during tuning, which increases the workload. Overall, the findings indicate that VLA offers practical advantages for changing tasks by reducing programming effort and enabling useful performance with minimal data, while DQN provides a viable baseline when sufficient tuning effort is acceptable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5efa\u7b51\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6280\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83VLA\u6a21\u578b\u548cRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u7a0b\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6240\u9700\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u63a5\u53e3\u6536\u96c6\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a1\uff09\u6bd4\u8f83MLP\u548cDQN\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e09\u79cdVLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b3\uff09\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73RL\u57fa\u7ebf\u548cVLA\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u62fe\u53d6\u9636\u6bb5\u8fbe\u523060%\u548c100%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff1bDQN\u7ecf\u8fc7\u8c03\u4f18\u540e\u53ef\u4ee5\u7a33\u5065\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u53d8\u66f4\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u7f16\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5e76\u4ee5\u6700\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff1bDQN\u5728\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u8db3\u591f\u8c03\u4f18\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the transferability of annealing dynamics in large language model training and refine a generalized predictive framework for optimizing annealing strategies under the Warmup-Steady-Decay (WSD) scheduler. Our improved framework incorporates training steps, maximum learning rate, and annealing behavior, enabling more efficient optimization of learning rate schedules. Our work provides a practical guidance for selecting optimal annealing strategies without exhaustive hyperparameter searches, demonstrating that smaller models can serve as reliable proxies for optimizing the training dynamics of larger models.

Key issues involve misinformation, authenticity, semantic fidelity, and interpretability. Most AIGC tools are opaque \"black boxes,\" hindering the dual demands of content accuracy and semantic alignment and creating ethical, sociotechnical, and trust dilemmas. This paper explores pathways for controllable image production in journalism's special coverage and conducts two experiments with projects from China's media agency: (1) Experiment 1 tests cross-platform adaptability via standardized prompts across three scenes, revealing disparities in semantic alignment, cultural specificity, and visual realism driven by training-corpus bias and platform-level filtering. (2) Experiment 2 builds a human-in-the-loop modular pipeline combining high-precision segmentation (SAM, GroundingDINO), semantic alignment (BrushNet), and style regulating (Style-LoRA, Prompt-to-Prompt), ensuring editorial fidelity through CLIP-based semantic scoring, NSFW/OCR/YOLO filtering, and verifiable content credentials. Traceable deployment preserves semantic representation. Consequently, we propose a human-AI collaboration mechanism for AIGC assisted image production in special coverage and recommend evaluating Character Identity Stability (CIS), Cultural Expression Accuracy (CEA), and User-Public Appropriateness (U-PA).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86AIGC\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "AIGC\u5de5\u5177\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u5f15\u53d1\u4e89\u8bae\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u5305\u62ec\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002\u5927\u591a\u6570AIGC\u5de5\u5177\u662f\"\u9ed1\u7bb1\"\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a(1) \u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e09\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff1b(2) \u6784\u5efa\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5206\u5272\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8c03\u8282\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7CLIP\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc4\u5206\u3001NSFW/OCR/YOLO\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5185\u5bb9\u51ed\u8bc1\u786e\u4fdd\u7f16\u8f91\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c1\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u6587\u5316\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7531\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u7ea7\u8fc7\u6ee4\u9a71\u52a8\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c2\u7684\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u90e8\u7f72\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\u7528\u4e8e\u7279\u6b8a\u62a5\u9053\u4e2d\u7684AIGC\u8f85\u52a9\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u4ea7\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u8bae\u8bc4\u4f30\u89d2\u8272\u8eab\u4efd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u6587\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7528\u6237-\u516c\u4f17\u9002\u5b9c\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing navigation systems adopt fixed execution configurations without considering environmental dynamics based on available computing resources, e.g., with a high execution frequency and task workload. This static approach causes rigid flight strategies and excessive computations, ultimately degrading flight performance or even leading to failures in UAVs. Despite the necessity for an adaptive system, dynamically adjusting workloads remains challenging, due to difficulties in quantifying environmental complexity and modeling the relationship between environment and system configuration. Aiming at adapting to dynamic environments, this paper proposes E-Navi, an environmental-adaptive navigation system for UAVs that dynamically adjusts task executions on the CPUs in response to environmental changes based on available computational resources. Specifically, the perception-planning pipeline of UAVs navigation system is redesigned through dynamic adaptation of mapping resolution and execution frequency, driven by the quantitative environmental complexity evaluations. In addition, E-Navi supports flexible deployment across hardware platforms with varying levels of computing capability. Extensive Hardware-In-the-Loop and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system significantly outperforms the baseline method across various hardware platforms, achieving up to 53.9% navigation task workload reduction, up to 63.8% flight time savings, and delivering more stable velocity control.", "AI": {"tldr": "E-Navi\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6267\u884c\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u98de\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u50f5\u5316\u548c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u98de\u884c\u6027\u80fd\u751a\u81f3\u5bfc\u81f4\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u611f\u77e5-\u89c4\u5212\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u6267\u884c\u9891\u7387\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9a\u91cf\u73af\u5883\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7075\u6d3b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u786c\u4ef6\u5728\u73af\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cE-Navi\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe53.9%\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u8d1f\u8f7d\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u9ad8\u8fbe63.8%\u7684\u98de\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "E-Navi\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u914d\u7f6e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Models available at https://huggingface.co/collections/MarioBarbeque/catastrophic-forgetting-in-mathematical-reasoning", "summary": "When finetuning large language models for specialized tasks such as mathematical reasoning, models exhibit catastrophic forgetting, losing previously learned capabilities. We investigate this by finetuning Flan-T5-Base (250M parameters) on the DeepMind Mathematics dataset and measuring forgetting on MultiNLI. Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\\% to 12.0\\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\\% to 16.5\\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\\%) provides effective regularization. These findings demonstrate that specialization need not require forgetting general capabilities, with implications for scaling to larger models where mixed training may confer additional benefits beyond forgetting prevention.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4e13\u95e8\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u5b66\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4e27\u5931\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u5e76\u627e\u5230\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728Flan-T5-Base\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u7eaf\u6570\u5b66\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u548cNLI\u793a\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a2\u7d22\u4ece1:1\u523015:1\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u7eaf\u6570\u5b66\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c06\u6570\u5b66\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece3.1%\u63d0\u5347\u523012.0%\uff0c\u4f46\u5bfc\u81f4NLI\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece81.0%\u66b4\u8dcc\u81f316.5%\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\uff081:1\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff09\u5728\u4fdd\u630112.0%\u6570\u5b66\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0cNLI\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7ef4\u6301\u572886.2%\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4ee5\u9057\u5fd8\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u8d85\u8d8a\u9057\u5fd8\u9884\u9632\u7684\u989d\u5916\u76ca\u5904\u3002"}}

Large language models can generate clinical text, yet they struggle with visual reasoning and often produce unstable or incorrect explanations. This leaves a gap between what a model sees and the type of reasoning a clinician expects. We introduce a framework that links image classification with structured clinical reasoning. A new hybrid model, MobileCoAtNet, is designed for endoscopic images and achieves high accuracy across eight stomach-related classes. Its outputs are then used to drive reasoning by several LLMs. To judge this reasoning, we build two expert-verified benchmarks covering causes, symptoms, treatment, lifestyle, and follow-up care. Thirty-two LLMs are evaluated against these gold standards. Strong classification improves the quality of their explanations, but none of the models reach human-level stability. Even the best LLMs change their reasoning when prompts vary. Our study shows that combining DL with LLMs can produce useful clinical narratives, but current LLMs remain unreliable for high-stakes medical decisions. The framework provides a clearer view of their limits and a path for building safer reasoning systems.

While modern detectors such as YOLOv8 offer strong baseline performance, single-model pipelines struggle to remain robust across the extreme scale transitions that occur during descent, where helipads appear small at high altitude and large near touchdown. To address this limitation, we propose a scale-adaptive dual-expert perception framework that decomposes the detection task into far-range and close-range regimes. Two YOLOv8 experts are trained on scale-specialized versions of the HelipadCat dataset, enabling one model to excel at detecting small, low-resolution helipads and the other to provide high-precision localization when the target dominates the field of view. During inference, both experts operate in parallel, and a geometric gating mechanism selects the expert whose prediction is most consistent with the AAV's viewpoint. This adaptive routing prevents the degradation commonly observed in single-detector systems when operating across wide altitude ranges. The dual-expert perception module is evaluated in a closed-loop landing environment that integrates CARLA's photorealistic rendering with NASA's GUAM flight-dynamics engine. Results show substantial improvements in alignment stability, landing accuracy, and overall robustness compared to single-detector baselines. By introducing a scale-aware expert routing strategy tailored to the landing problem, this work advances resilient vision-based perception for autonomous descent and provides a foundation for future multi-expert AAV frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u53cc\u4e13\u5bb6\u611f\u77e5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u5728GPS\u7f3a\u5931\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u9000\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7740\u9646\u65f6\u7684\u505c\u673a\u576a\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684YOLOv8\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7740\u9646\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u7740\u9646\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4ece\u9ad8\u7a7a\u5230\u8fd1\u5730\u7684\u5927\u8303\u56f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f53\u505c\u673a\u576a\u5728\u9ad8\u7a7a\u663e\u5f97\u5c0f\u800c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u8fd1\u5730\u5360\u636e\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u89c6\u91ce\u65f6\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u4e2aYOLOv8\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u8fd1\u8ddd\u79bb\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5e76\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u6700\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u96c6\u6210CARLA\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6e32\u67d3\u548cNASA GUAM\u98de\u884c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7740\u9646\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u51c6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u7740\u9646\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u7740\u9646\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u4e13\u5bb6\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We investigate this limitation using two challenging datasets: (1) three-stage Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification (normal, mild cognitive impairment, dementia), where category differences are visually subtle, and (2) MIMIC-CXR chest radiograph classification with 14 non-mutually exclusive conditions. Our empirical study shows that text-only reasoning consistently outperforms vision-only or vision-text settings, with multimodal inputs often performing worse than text alone. To mitigate this, we explore three strategies: (1) in-context learning with reason-annotated exemplars, (2) vision captioning followed by text-only inference, and (3) few-shot fine-tuning of the vision tower with classification supervision.

Context-adaptive meta reinforcement learning addresses these limitations by conditioning on the task representation, yet they mostly rely on complete action information in the experience making task inference tightly coupled to a specific policy. This paper introduces Context Representation via Action Free Transformer encoder decoder (CRAFT), a belief model that infers task representations solely from sequences of states and rewards. By removing the dependence on actions, CRAFT decouples task inference from policy optimization, supports modular training, and leverages amortized variational inference for scalable belief updates. Built on a transformer encoder decoder with rotary positional embeddings, the model captures long range temporal dependencies and robustly encodes both parametric and non-parametric task variations. Experiments on the MetaWorld ML-10 robotic manipulation benchmark show that CRAFT achieves faster adaptation, improved generalization, and more effective exploration compared to context adaptive meta--RL baselines. These findings highlight the potential of action-free inference as a foundation for scalable RL in robotic control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CRAFT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u63a8\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5143\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002CRAFT\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CRAFT\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e26\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684Transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u5e8f\u5217\u8fdb\u884c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u793a\u63a8\u65ad\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728MetaWorld ML-10\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCRAFT\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52a8\u4f5c\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u63a8\u65ad\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0cCRAFT\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data.

By freezing the parameters of the fundamental autoregressive (AR) model and progressively stacking isomorphic AR modules, it avoids cross-task interference while expanding the model's capabilities. Concurrently, we introduce a high-capacity VQ to enhance the granularity of image representations and employ an implicit reasoning mechanism to improve generation quality under complex conditions. Experiments demonstrate that STAR achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenEval (0.91), DPG-Bench (87.44), and ImgEdit (4.34), validating its efficacy for unified multimodal learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "STAR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5806\u53e0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u907f\u514d\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5806\u53e0\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1b\u51bb\u7ed3\u57fa\u7840AR\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9010\u6b65\u5806\u53e0\u540c\u6784AR\u6a21\u5757\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5bb9\u91cfVQ\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u7c92\u5ea6\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf", "result": "\u5728GenEval(0.91)\u3001DPG-Bench(87.44)\u548cImgEdit(4.34)\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "STAR\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

We propose the Configuration Space Ergonomic Field (CSEF), a continuous and differentiable field over the human joint space that quantifies ergonomic quality and provides gradients for real-time ergonomics-aware planning. An efficient algorithm constructs CSEF from established metrics with joint-wise weighting and task conditioning, and we integrate it into a gradient-based planner compatible with impedance-controlled robots. In a 2-DoF benchmark, CSEF-based planning achieves higher success rates, lower ergonomic cost, and faster computation than a task-space ergonomic planner. Hardware experiments with a dual-arm robot in unimanual guidance, collaborative drilling, and bimanual cocarrying show faster ergonomic cost reduction, closer tracking to optimized joint targets, and lower muscle activation than a point-to-point baseline. CSEF-based planning method reduces average ergonomic scores by up to 10.31% for collaborative drilling tasks and 5.60% for bimanual co-carrying tasks while decreasing activation in key muscle groups, indicating practical benefits for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u573a\uff08CSEF\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u611f\u77e5\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u75b2\u52b3\u548c\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u8fc5\u901f\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u64cd\u4f5c\u4eba\u5458\u7684\u75b2\u52b3\u548c\u808c\u8089\u9aa8\u9abc\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CSEF\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u5173\u8282\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u573a\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u68af\u5ea6\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u5df2\u6709\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efaCSEF\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u57282\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCSEF\u89c4\u5212\u6bd4\u4efb\u52a1\u7a7a\u95f4\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u6210\u672c\u548c\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u5728\u5355\u81c2\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u94bb\u5b54\u548c\u53cc\u81c2\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u964d\u4f4e\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4f18\u5316\u5173\u8282\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u808c\u8089\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "CSEF\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u534f\u4f5c\u94bb\u5b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u8bc4\u5206\u964d\u4f4e10.31%\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u81c2\u534f\u540c\u642c\u8fd0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u964d\u4f4e5.60%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5173\u952e\u808c\u7fa4\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While much progress has been made in unlearning for LLMs, document classification models remain relatively understudied. In this paper, we study class-level unlearning for document classifiers and present Hessian Reassignment, a two-step, model-agnostic solution. First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification. On standard text benchmarks, Hessian Reassignment achieves retained-class accuracy close to full retrain-without-class while running orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, it consistently lowers membership-inference advantage on the removed class, measured with pooled multi-shadow attacks.

The scientific novelty lies in the derivation of a real-time risk indicator that is backend-agnostic and exploits the Schur complement blocks of the Gauss-Newton normal matrix to propagate uncertainties. Practically, the Schur complement captures the sensitivity that reflects the influence of the uncertainty on the risk occurrence. Our framework estimates risks on the basis of the residual magnitudes, geometric conditioning, and short horizon temporal trends without requiring ground truth knowledge. Our framework enables to reliably predict trajectory degradation 50 frames ahead with an improvement of 20% to the baseline. In addition, SUPER initiates a stop or relocalization policy with 89.1% recall. The framework is backend agnostic and operates in real time with less than 0.2% additional CPU cost. Experiments show that SUPER provides consistent uncertainty estimates. A SLAM evaluation highlights the applicability to long horizon mapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "SUPER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u60ef\u6027\u91cc\u7a0b\u8ba1\uff08VIO\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\u5373\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u9000\u5316\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VO/VIO/SLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9e\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u6307\u6807\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u9ad8\u65af-\u725b\u987f\u6b63\u89c4\u77e9\u9635\u7684Schur\u8865\u5757\u4f20\u64ad\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b8b\u5dee\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u77ed\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u540e\u7aef\u65e0\u5173\u4e14\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u524d50\u5e27\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u8f68\u8ff9\u9000\u5316\uff08\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u534720%\uff09\uff0c\u542f\u52a8\u505c\u6b62\u6216\u91cd\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u8fbe89.1%\uff0c\u989d\u5916CPU\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4e8e0.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "SUPER\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684 uncertainty \u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u65f6\u7a0bSLAM\uff0c\u662f\u540e\u7aef\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This study developed a machine learning framework to predict RSV-associated hospitalizations in the United States (U.S.) by integrating wastewater surveillance, meteorological, and air quality data. The dataset combined weekly hospitalization rates, wastewater RSV levels, daily meteorological measurements, and air pollutant concentrations. Classification models, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosting, were trained to predict weekly RSV-associated hospitalization rates classified as \\textit{Low risk}, \\textit{Alert}, and \\textit{Epidemic} levels. The wastewater RSV level was identified as the strongest predictor, followed by meteorological and air quality variables such as temperature, ozone levels, and specific humidity. Notably, the analysis also revealed significantly higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Further research is needed to better understand the drivers of RSV disparity in these communities to improve prevention strategies. Furthermore, states at high altitudes, characterized by lower surface pressure, showed consistently higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates. These findings highlight the value of combining environmental and community surveillance data to forecast RSV outbreaks, enabling more timely public health interventions and resource allocation. In order to provide accessibility and practical use of the models, we have developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard (https://f6yxlu-eric-guo.shinyapps.io/rsv_app/), which allows users to explore RSV-associated hospitalization risk levels across different states, visualize the impact of key predictors, and interactively generate RSV outbreak forecasts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5e9f\u6c34\u76d1\u6d4b\u3001\u6c14\u8c61\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u7f8e\u56fdRSV\u76f8\u5173\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e9f\u6c34RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u4eba\u7fa4\u548c\u5730\u533a\u7684RSV\u98ce\u9669\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "RSV\u662f\u5bfc\u81f4\u513f\u7ae5\u4f4f\u9662\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5176\u66b4\u53d1\u53d7\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u5f3a\u70c8\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u652f\u6301\u53ca\u65f6\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u6bcf\u5468\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u3001\u5e9f\u6c34RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u3001\u6c14\u8c61\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u7a7a\u6c14\u6c61\u67d3\u7269\u6d53\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CART\u3001\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u548cBoosting\u7b49\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4bRSV\u4f4f\u9662\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\uff08\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3001\u8b66\u62a5\u3001\u6d41\u884c\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5e9f\u6c34RSV\u6c34\u5e73\u662f\u6700\u5f3a\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u5176\u6b21\u662f\u6e29\u5ea6\u548c\u81ed\u6c27\u7b49\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u7f8e\u56fd\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11\u548c\u963f\u62c9\u65af\u52a0\u539f\u4f4f\u6c11RSV\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u9ad8\u6d77\u62d4\u5730\u533a\u4f4f\u9662\u7387\u4e5f\u6301\u7eed\u8f83\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u793e\u533a\u76d1\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4bRSV\u66b4\u53d1\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0fR Shiny\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u4f9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u4f9b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge. Federated fine-tuning achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.43 (centralized: 0.52), Cohen's kappa of 0.42 (0.49), and weighted F1 of 0.69 (0.74). In the FFSL stage, client-specific models reached an average balanced accuracy of 0.77, Cohen's kappa of 0.62, and weighted F1 of 0.73 across four sites with heterogeneous event distributions. These results suggest that FFSL can support effective patient-adaptive seizure detection under realistic data-availability and privacy constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8054\u90a6\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316EEG\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "EEG\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7a00\u7f3a\u3001\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u53d7\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u96c6\u4e2d\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u533b\u7597\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u533b\u9662\u7ad9\u70b9\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684BIOT\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u4ec55\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0EEG\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u60a3\u8005\u8fdb\u884c\u8054\u90a6\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u9002\u914d", "result": "\u8054\u90a6\u5fae\u8c03\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u73870.43\uff0cFFSL\u9636\u6bb5\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe0.77\uff0cCohen's kappa 0.62\uff0c\u52a0\u6743F1 0.73", "conclusion": "FFSL\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u652f\u6301\u6709\u6548\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u766b\u75eb\u68c0\u6d4b"}}

Despite recent progress, current teleoperation systems still suffer from limitations in efficiency and ergonomics, particularly in challenging scenarios. In this paper, we propose CaFe-TeleVision, a coarse-to-fine teleoperation system with immersive situated visualization for enhanced ergonomics. At its core, a coarse-to-fine control mechanism is proposed in the retargeting module to bridge workspace disparities, jointly optimizing efficiency and physical ergonomics. To stream immersive feedback with adequate visual cues for human vision systems, an on-demand situated visualization technique is integrated in the perception module, which reduces the cognitive load for multi-view processing. The system is built on a humanoid collaborative robot and validated with six challenging bimanual manipulation tasks. User study among 24 participants confirms that CaFe-TeleVision enhances ergonomics with statistical significance, indicating a lower task load and a higher user acceptance during teleoperation. Quantitative results also validate the superior performance of our system across six tasks, surpassing comparative methods by up to 28.89% in success rate and accelerating by 26.81% in completion time.

For example, in a mobile shopping interface, users interact with recommendations by scrolling, where each scroll triggers a list of items called slate. Users incur an evaluation cost - time spent assessing item features before deciding to click. Highly relevant items having higher evaluation costs may not fit within the user's time budget, affecting engagement. In this position paper, our objective is to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that learn patterns in user preferences and time budgets simultaneously, crafting recommendations with higher engagement potential under resource constraints. Our experiments explore the use of reinforcement learning to recommend items for users using Alibaba's Personalized Re-ranking dataset supporting slate optimization in e-commerce contexts. Our contributions include (i) a unified formulation of time-constrained slate recommendation modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with budget-aware utilities; (ii) a simulation framework to study policy behavior on re-ranking data; and (iii) empirical evidence that on-policy and off-policy control can improve performance under tight time budgets than traditional contextual bandit-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684slate\u63a8\u8350\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u963f\u91cc\u5df4\u5df4\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8350\u4efb\u52a1\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u6709\u9650\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u8350\u7269\u54c1\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4f46\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7269\u54c1\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u7528\u6237\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7684slate\u63a8\u8350\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u9884\u7b97\u611f\u77e5\u6548\u7528\u7684\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8d4c\u535a\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u9ad8\u7528\u6237\u53c2\u4e0e\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u7269\u54c1\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7528\u6237\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u8350\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

Recent works perform latent space diffusion, either on the whole latent at once or auto-regressively over multiple latents. In this paper, we study how to make diffusion on continuous motion latents work best. We focus on two questions: (1) how to build a semantically aligned latent space so diffusion becomes more effective, and (2) how to best inject text conditioning so the motion follows the description closely. We propose a semantic-aligned motion encoder trained with frame-level text labels so that latents with similar text meaning stay close, which makes the latent space more diffusion-friendly. We also compare single-token conditioning with a multi-token cross-attention scheme and find that cross-attention gives better motion realism and text-motion alignment. With semantically aligned latents, auto-regressive generation, and cross-attention text conditioning, our model sets a new state of the art in human motion generation on standard metrics and in a user study.

These may appear as gradual drifts, transient fluctuations, or abrupt shifts, demanding real-time adaptation that is robust to short-term variation yet responsive to lasting change. We propose a framework for modeling the nonlinear dynamics of robotic systems that can be updated in real time from streaming data. The method decouples representation learning from online adaptation, using latent representations learned offline to support online closed-form Bayesian updates. To handle evolving conditions, we introduce a changepoint-aware mechanism with a latent variable inferred from data likelihoods that indicates continuity or shift. When continuity is likely, evidence accumulates to refine predictions; when a shift is detected, past information is tempered to enable rapid re-learning. This maintains calibrated uncertainty and supports probabilistic reasoning about transient, gradual, or structural change. We prove that the adaptive regret of the framework grows only logarithmically in time and linearly with the number of shifts, competitive with an oracle that knows timings of shift.

Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns.\n  We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies.\n  With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines.

Existing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods apply uniform adapter dimensions across all transformer layers, leading to suboptimal parameter allocation and reduced adaptation efficiency. We introduce Telescopic Adapters, a novel PEFT framework that employs depth-aware scaling to progressively increase adapter capacity from shallow to deep transformer layers. Our method integrates lightweight bottleneck modules within CLIPSeg's vision and text encoders, with adapter dimensions dynamically scaled based on layer depth and semantic relevance. Using only 613k trainable parameters--244x fewer than end-to-end fine-tuning, Telescopic Adapters achieve superior performance across five diverse medical datasets spanning polyp segmentation, skin lesion detection, and breast ultrasound imaging. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate that deeper layers require substantially more adaptation capacity than shallow layers, validating our telescopic scaling hypothesis.

While above-canopy flight has reached a high level of autonomy, navigating under-canopy remains a significant challenge. The use of autonomous UAVs could reduce the burden of data collection, which has motivated the development of numerous solutions for under-canopy autonomous flight. However, the experiments conducted in the literature and their reporting lack rigor. Very rarely, the density and the difficulty of the test forests are reported, or multiple flights are flown, and the success rate of those flights is reported. The aim of this study was to implement an autonomously flying quadrotor based on a lightweight lidar using openly available algorithms and test its behavior in real forest environments. A set of rigorous experiments was conducted with a quadrotor prototype utilizing the IPC path planner and LTA-OM SLAM algorithm. Based on the results of the first 33 flights, the original system was further enhanced. With the optimized system, 60 flights were performed, resulting in a total of 93 test flights. The optimized system performed significantly better in terms of reliability and flight mission completion times, achieving success rates of 12/15 in a medium-density forest and 15/15 in a dense forest, at a target flight velocity of 1 m/s. At a target flight velocity of 2 m/s, it had a success rate of 12/15 and 5/15, respectively.

While recent methods like Dion reduce per-step communication through low-rank updates, they synchronize at every step regardless of the optimization landscape. We observe that synchronization requirements vary dramatically throughout training: workers naturally compute similar gradients in flat regions, making frequent synchronization redundant, while high-curvature regions require coordination to prevent divergence.

As a remedy, synthetic simulators are adopted to generate annotated data, with a low annotation cost. However, the domain gap between synthetic and real images hinders the model from being effectively applied to the target domain. Accordingly, we introduce Coarse-to-Fine Hierarchical Alignment (CFHA), a three-stage diffusion-based framework designed to transform synthetic data for UAV-based human detection, narrowing the domain gap while preserving the original synthetic labels. CFHA explicitly decouples global style and local content domain discrepancies and bridges those gaps using three modules: (1) Global Style Transfer -- a diffusion model aligns color, illumination, and texture statistics of synthetic images to the realistic style, using only a small real reference set; (2) Local Refinement -- a super-resolution diffusion model is used to facilitate fine-grained and photorealistic details for the small objects, such as human instances, preserving shape and boundary integrity; (3) Hallucination Removal -- a module that filters out human instances whose visual attributes do not align with real-world data to make the human appearance closer to the target distribution. Extensive experiments on public UAV Sim2Real detection benchmarks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve the detection accuracy compared to the non-transformed baselines. Specifically, our method achieves up to $+14.1$ improvement of mAP50 on Semantic-Drone benchmark. Ablation studies confirm the complementary roles of the global and local stages and highlight the importance of hierarchical alignment.

However, during deployment, the parameters of the underlying MPC must usually be fine-tuned. This often renders AMPC impractical as it requires repeatedly generating a new dataset and retraining the neural network. Recent work addresses this problem by adapting AMPC without retraining using approximated sensitivities of the MPC's optimization problem. Currently, this adaption must be done by hand, which is labor-intensive and can be unintuitive for high-dimensional systems. To solve this issue, we propose using Bayesian optimization to tune the parameters of AMPC policies based on experimental data. By combining model-based control with direct and local learning, our approach achieves superior performance to nominal AMPC on hardware, with minimal experimentation. This allows automatic and data-efficient adaptation of AMPC to new system instances and fine-tuning to cost functions that are difficult to directly implement in MPC.

Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout.

With this in mind, one would expect video reasoning models to reason flexibly across different durations. However, SOTA models are still trained to predict answers in a single turn while processing a large number of frames, akin to watching an entire long video, requiring significant resources. This raises the question: Is it possible to develop performant any-horizon video reasoning systems? Inspired by human behavior, we first propose SAGE, an agent system that performs multi-turn reasoning on long videos while handling simpler problems in a single turn. Secondly, we introduce an easy synthetic data generation pipeline using Gemini-2.5-Flash to train the orchestrator, SAGE-MM, which lies at the core of SAGE. We further propose an effective RL post-training recipe essential for instilling any-horizon reasoning ability in SAGE-MM. Thirdly, we curate SAGE-Bench with an average duration of greater than 700 seconds for evaluating video reasoning ability in real-world entertainment use cases. Lastly, we empirically validate the effectiveness of our system, data, and RL recipe, observing notable improvements of up to 6.1% on open-ended video reasoning tasks, as well as an impressive 8.2% improvement on videos longer than 10 minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSAGE\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u5e27\uff0c\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u6839\u636e\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u63a8\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faSAGE\u4ee3\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u5904\u7406\u957f\u89c6\u9891\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528Gemini-2.5-Flash\u6784\u5efa\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u9053\u8bad\u7ec3\u6838\u5fc3\u534f\u8c03\u5668SAGE-MM\uff1b3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1b4) \u6784\u5efaSAGE-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u65f6\u957f>700\u79d2\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5f00\u653e\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u63d0\u53476.1%\uff0c\u572810\u5206\u949f\u4ee5\u4e0a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u63d0\u53478.2%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SAGE\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

It is crucial to detect both dynamic road users and static objects like traffic signs or lanes as these are required for safe motion planning. However, in many circumstances a complete perception of other objects or lanes is not achievable due to limited sensor ranges, occlusions, and curves. In scenarios where an accurate localization is not possible or for roads where no HD maps are available, an autonomous vehicle must rely solely on its perceived road information. Thus, extending local sensing capabilities through collective perception using vehicle-to-vehicle communication is a promising strategy that has not yet been explored for lane detection. Therefore, we propose a real-time capable approach for collective perception of lanes using a spline-based estimation of undetected road sections. We evaluate our proposed fusion algorithm in various situations and road types.

This challenge is ubiquitous in fields such as fluid mechanics, seismic inversion, and structural health monitoring. Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\\%$--$88.73\\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PIS\uff08Physical Inversion Solver\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u96c6\u5408\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u51b3PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u3001\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5e03\u5c40\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eSet Transformer\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4f59\u5f26\u9000\u706b\u7a00\u758f\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4f34\u968f\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u6781\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aPDE\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\uff08Darcy\u6d41\u3001Helmholtz\u6ce2\u573a\u53cd\u6f14\u3001Hooke\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7ed3\u6784\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cPIS\u57280.29%\u89c2\u6d4b\u7387\u7684\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u7a33\u5b9a\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u53cd\u6f14\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e12.28%-88.73%\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u6837\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "PIS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u5177\u6709\u72ec\u7279\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53cd\u6f14\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u6b20\u91c7\u6837\u89c2\u6d4b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Our key insight is distinguishing between competing queries (targeting the same object) versus complementary queries (targeting different objects) using inter-query similarity, confidence scores, and geometry. We introduce dual routing mechanisms: suppressor routes that modulate attention between competing queries to reduce duplication, and delegator routes that encourage exploration of different regions. These are implemented via learnable low-rank attention biases enabling asymmetric query interactions. A dual-branch training strategy incorporates routing biases only during training while preserving standard attention for inference, ensuring no additional computational cost. Experiments on COCO and Cityscapes demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple DETR baselines, achieving +1.7% mAP gain over DINO on ResNet-50 and reaching 57.6% mAP on Swin-L, surpassing prior state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Route-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6210\u5bf9\u8def\u7531\u89e3\u51b3DETR\u4e2d\u67e5\u8be2\u7ade\u4e89\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6291\u5236\u8def\u7531\u548c\u59d4\u6258\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u8def\u7531\u504f\u7f6e\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728COCO\u548cCityscapes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "DETR\u5b58\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u7ade\u4e89\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u591a\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u533a\u5206\u7ade\u4e89\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u4e92\u8865\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u67e5\u8be2\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f97\u5206\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u533a\u5206\u67e5\u8be2\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6291\u5236\u8def\u7531\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\uff0c\u59d4\u6258\u8def\u7531\u9f13\u52b1\u533a\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u79e9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u504f\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u67e5\u8be2\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565", "result": "\u5728COCO\u548cCityscapes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2aDETR\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0cResNet-50\u4e0a\u6bd4DINO\u63d0\u5347+1.7% mAP\uff0cSwin-L\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523057.6% mAP\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "Route-DETR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DETR\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7ade\u4e89\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd"}}

Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. Compared to other compression techniques, our approach consistently outperforms fine-tuning-free variants of SVD-LLM and LLM-Pruner across datasets and compression rates.

This work targets faster development cycles and improved robustness in complex, contested settings by exposing humanoid systems to broad scenario diversity early in the development process.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omnia\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a0\u901f\u519b\u4e8b\u5316\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u51c6\u5907\u3002\u8be5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5c06\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b9e\u5730\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5b58\u5728\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u98ce\u9669\u5927\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u9650\u5236\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6c\u6362\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u7a7a\u95f4\u89c2\u5bdf\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u89c6\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u667a\u80fd\u773c\u955c\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u5934\u663e\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6d4f\u89c8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\uff09\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6a21\u62df\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u8c03\u6574\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u4f5c\u6218\u73af\u5883\u548c\u5a01\u80c1\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u7840\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5982\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u53cd\u68c0\u6d4b\u751f\u5b58\u80fd\u529b\u548cCBRNE\u76f8\u5173\u4fa6\u5bdf\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u8ba9\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a5\u89e6\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u5468\u671f\u548c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Federated Recommendation (FR) enables such multi-end collaborative training while preserving privacy by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. However, the large number of parameters, primarily due to the massive item embeddings, significantly hampers communication efficiency. While existing studies mainly focus on improving the efficiency of FR models, they largely overlook the issue of embedding parameter overhead. To address this gap, we propose a FR training framework with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) based embedding designed to reduce the volume of embedding parameters that need to be transmitted. Our approach offers a lightweight, plugin-style solution that can be seamlessly integrated into existing FR methods. In addition to incorporating common PEFT techniques such as LoRA and Hash-based encoding, we explore the use of Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RQ-VAE) as a novel PEFT strategy within our framework. Extensive experiments across various FR model backbones and datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly reduces communication overhead while improving accuracy.

For texturing, conditional image generators now allow the synthesis of realistic RGB images of a 3D scene that align with the geometry of that scene. For appearance modeling, SVBRDF prediction networks recover material parameters from RGB images. Combining these technologies allows us to quickly generate SVBRDF maps for multiple views of a 3D scene, which can be merged to form a SVBRDF texture atlas of that scene. In this paper, we analyze the challenges and opportunities for SVBRDF prediction in the context of such a fast appearance modeling pipeline. On the one hand, single-view SVBRDF predictions might suffer from multiview incoherence and yield inconsistent texture atlases. On the other hand, generated RGB images, and the different modalities on which they are conditioned, can provide additional information for SVBRDF estimation compared to photographs. We compare neural architectures and conditions to identify designs that achieve high accuracy and coherence. We find that, surprisingly, a standard UNet is competitive with more complex designs.

The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is often used as a foundation for this, but its signals can be unreliable in obstructed environments due to multi-path effects or loss-of-signal. While existing datasets compensate for the sporadic loss of GNSS signals by incorporating Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) measurements, the commonly used Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) or Fiber Optic Gyroscope (FOG)-based systems do not permit the prolonged study of GNSS-denied environments. To close this gap, we present Odyssey, a LIO dataset with a focus on GNSS-denied environments such as tunnels and parking garages as well as other underrepresented, yet ubiquitous situations such as stop-and-go-traffic, bumpy roads and wide open fields. Our ground truth is derived from a navigation-grade Inertial Navigation System (INS) equipped with a Ring Laser Gyroscope (RLG), offering exceptional bias stability characteristics compared to IMUs used in existing datasets and enabling the prolonged and accurate study of GNSS-denied environments.

While existing approaches excel in recognizing the distinct patterns under the low-dimensional scenarios, they often fail to robustly capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies when learning representations from the high-dimensional noisy time series. To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs. A series of ablation studies are also conducted to explore the crucial design factors of our proposed components.

While prior work targets general concepts (e.g., styles, celebrities), it fails to address specific brand identifiers. Crucially, we note that brand recognition is multi-dimensional, extending beyond explicit logos to encompass distinctive structural features (e.g., a car's front grille). To tackle this, we introduce unbranding, a novel task for the fine-grained removal of both trademarks and subtle structural brand features, while preserving semantic coherence. To facilitate research, we construct a comprehensive benchmark dataset. Recognizing that existing brand detectors are limited to logos and fail to capture abstract trade dress (e.g., the shape of a Coca-Cola bottle), we introduce a novel evaluation metric based on Vision Language Models (VLMs). This VLM-based metric uses a question-answering framework to probe images for both explicit logos and implicit, holistic brand characteristics. Furthermore, we observe that as model fidelity increases, with newer systems (SDXL, FLUX) synthesizing brand identifiers more readily than older models (Stable Diffusion), the urgency of the unbranding challenge is starkly highlighted. Our results, validated by our VLM metric, confirm unbranding is a distinct, practically relevant problem requiring specialized techniques.

The torsional capability index TI_1 and tilting capability index TI_2 are defined to evaluate the orientation performance of the mechanism. Numerical simulation studies are completed to indicate the analysis, providing reasonable but essential references for the parameter optimization of 3-(PP(2-(UPS))) and other similar redundant parallel mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b3-(PP(2-(UPS)))\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u8054\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f53\u79ef\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u5411\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u626d\u8f6c\u80fd\u529b\u6307\u6570TI_1\u548c\u503e\u659c\u80fd\u529b\u6307\u6570TI_2\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u6784\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u8054\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5927\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u672c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u578b3-(PP(2-(UPS)))\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u8054\u673a\u6784\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5173\u952e\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49TI_1\u548cTI_2\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a3-(PP(2-(UPS)))\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u8054\u673a\u6784\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5197\u4f59\u5e76\u8054\u673a\u6784\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations. We evaluated the performance of our model on the publicly available datasets MODMA and PRED+CT and show a significant improvement in accuracy, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 5.87% and 9.96%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u548c\u591a\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u635f\u5931\uff08TF-MCL\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cd\u5ea6\u6291\u90c1\u75c7\uff08MDD\uff09\u7684\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5934\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728MDD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8868\u5f81\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8bed\u4e49\u6570\u636e\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "TF-MCL\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u6620\u5c04\u5934\uff08FMH\uff09\u5c06\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u878d\u5408\u57df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u591a\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4ee5\u91cd\u6784\u65f6\u9891\u57df\u548c\u878d\u5408\u57df\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6MODMA\u548cPRED+CT\u4e0a\uff0cTF-MCL\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.87%\u548c9.96%\u3002", "conclusion": "TF-MCL\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u878d\u5408\u548c\u591a\u57df\u4ea4\u53c9\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MDD\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8111\u7535\u56fe\u4fe1\u53f7\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

These factors degrade image quality, while the scarcity and structural repetition of marine datasets limit the diversity of available training data. Although mask-conditioned diffusion models can synthesize layout-aligned samples, they often produce low-diversity outputs when conditioned on low-entropy masks and prompts, limiting their utility for improving robustness. In this paper, we propose a quality-driven and diversity-aware sample expansion pipeline that generates training data entirely at inference time, without retraining the diffusion model. The framework combines two key components:(i) a class-aware style bank that constructs high-entropy, semantically grounded prompts, and (ii) an adaptive annealing sampler that perturbs early conditioning, while a COD-guided proportional controller regulates this perturbation to boost diversity without compromising layout fidelity. Across marine obstacle benchmarks, augmenting training data with these controlled synthetic samples consistently improves segmentation performance across multiple backbones and increases visual variation in rare and texture-sensitive classes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8d28\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u6d77\u6d0b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5206\u5272\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6d77\u6d0b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u9633\u5149\u95ea\u70c1\u3001\u96fe\u6c14\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6ce2\u6d6a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u5272\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u7d20\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u800c\u6d77\u6d0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7a00\u7f3a\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d28\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(i) \u4e00\u4e2a\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u98ce\u683c\u5e93\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u71b5\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u63d0\u793a\uff1b(ii) \u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9000\u706b\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u65e9\u671f\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7COD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8c03\u8282\u6270\u52a8\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u5e03\u5c40\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d77\u6d0b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d7\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u7a00\u6709\u548c\u7eb9\u7406\u654f\u611f\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6d77\u6d0b\u969c\u788d\u7269\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have advanced robotic manipulation by leveraging large language models, yet remain fundamentally limited by Supervised Finetuning (SFT): requiring hundreds of demonstrations per task, rigidly memorizing trajectories, and failing to adapt when deployment conditions deviate from training. We introduce EVOLVE-VLA, a test-time training framework enabling VLAs to continuously adapt through environment interaction with minimal or zero task-specific demonstrations. The key technical challenge is replacing oracle reward signals (unavailable at test time) with autonomous feedback. We address this through a learned progress estimator providing dense feedback, and critically, we design our framework to ``tame'' this inherently noisy signal via two mechanisms: (1) an accumulative progress estimation mechanism smoothing noisy point-wise estimates, and (2) a progressive horizon extension strategy enabling gradual policy evolution.

Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism.

This challenge, where a high-performing model fails catastrophically on external datasets, is a critical barrier to trustworthy AI. Addressing this requires moving beyond simple performance metrics toward deeper understanding, making Explainable AI (XAI) an essential diagnostic tool in medical image analysis. We present a rigorous, two-phase approach to diagnose the generalization failure of state-of-the-art State-Space Models (SSMs), specifically UMamaba, applied to cerebrovascular segmentation. We first established a quantifiable domain gap between our Source (RSNA CTA Aneurysm) and Target (TopCoW Circle of Willis CT) datasets, noting significant differences in Z-resolution and background noise. The model's Dice score subsequently plummeted from 0.8604 (Source) to 0.2902 (Target). In the second phase, which is our core contribution, we utilized Seg-XRes-CAM to diagnose the cause of this failure. We quantified the model's focus by measuring the overlap between its attention maps and the Ground Truth segmentations, and between its attention maps and its own Prediction Mask. Our analysis proves the model failed to generalize because its attention mechanism abandoned true anatomical features in the Target domain. Quantitative metrics confirm the model's focus shifted away from the Ground Truth vessels (IoU~0.101 at 0.3 threshold) while still aligning with its own wrong predictions (IoU~0.282 at 0.3 threshold). This demonstrates the model learned spurious correlations, confirming XAI is a powerful diagnostic tool for identifying dataset bias in emerging architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bca\u65adSSM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8111\u8840\u7ba1\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7XAI\u5de5\u5177\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u53d7\u5230\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528XAI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u91cf\u5316\u6e90\u57df\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528Seg-XRes-CAM\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5272\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u91cd\u53e0\u6765\u8bca\u65ad\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\u4ece0.8604\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u52300.2902\u3002\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u8840\u7ba1\u8f6c\u79fb\uff08IoU~0.101\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4e0e\u81ea\u8eab\u9519\u8bef\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08IoU~0.282\uff09\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u4e86\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "XAI\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u65b0\u5174\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u4e2d\u653e\u5f03\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u89e3\u5256\u7279\u5f81\u3002"}}

This study provides a comparative evaluation of embedding-based methods for financial news sentiment classification in resource-constrained environments. Word2Vec, GloVe, and sentence transformer representations are evaluated in combination with gradient boosting on manually labeled headlines. Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification. For practitioners operating with limited resources, the results indicate the need to consider alternative approaches such as few-shot learning, data augmentation, or lexicon-enhanced hybrid methods when labeled samples are scarce.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u65b0\u95fb\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u8fc7\u5c0f\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6NLP\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u91d1\u878d\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Word2Vec\u3001GloVe\u548c\u53e5\u5b50\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b0\u95fb\u6807\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5982\u7b80\u5355\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u65f6\u6536\u76ca\u9012\u51cf", "conclusion": "\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u7a00\u7f3a\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6216\u8bcd\u5178\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

However, existing CP approaches often optimize for vehicle detection performance metrics, underperforming on smaller, safety-critical objects such as pedestrians, where detection failures can be catastrophic. Furthermore, previous CP methods rely on full feature exchange rather than communicating only salient features that help reduce false negatives. To this end, we present FocalComm, a novel collaborative perception framework that focuses on exchanging hard-instance-oriented features among connected collaborative agents. FocalComm consists of two key novel designs: (1) a learnable progressive hard instance mining (HIM) module to extract hard instance-oriented features per agent, and (2) a query-based feature-level (intermediate) fusion technique that dynamically weights these identified features during collaboration. We show that FocalComm outperforms state-of-the-art collaborative perception methods on two challenging real-world datasets (V2X-Real and DAIR-V2X) across both vehicle-centric and infrastructure-centric collaborative setups.

We study constrained policy learning where model parameters must satisfy unknown, rollout-based safety constraints. We propose SCPO, a sampling-based weight-space projection method that enforces safety directly in parameter space without requiring gradient access to the constraint functions. Our approach constructs a local safe region by combining trajectory rollouts with smoothness bounds that relate parameter changes to shifts in safety metrics. Each gradient update is then projected via a convex SOCP, producing a safe first-order step. We establish a safe-by-induction guarantee: starting from any safe initialization, all intermediate policies remain safe given feasible projections. In constrained control settings with a stabilizing backup policy, our approach further ensures closed-loop stability and enables safe adaptation beyond the conservative backup.

Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) has emerged as a promising strategy by duplicating layers and applying Continual Pre-training (CPT), but its reliance on feed-forward networks (FFNs) limits efficiency and attainable gains. We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off.

However, their inference speed remains suboptimal due to the need to repeatedly process redundant masked tokens at every sampling step. In this work, we propose Sparse-LaViDa, a novel modeling framework that dynamically truncates unnecessary masked tokens at each inference step to accelerate MDM sampling.

While successful navigation demands both global environmental reasoning and local scene comprehension, existing UAV agents typically adopt mono-granularity frameworks that struggle to balance these two aspects. To address this limitation, this work proposes a History-Enhanced Two-Stage Transformer (HETT) framework, which integrates the two aspects through a coarse-to-fine navigation pipeline. Specifically, HETT first predicts coarse-grained target positions by fusing spatial landmarks and historical context, then refines actions via fine-grained visual analysis. In addition, a historical grid map is designed to dynamically aggregate visual features into a structured spatial memory, enhancing comprehensive scene awareness. Additionally, the CityNav dataset annotations are manually refined to enhance data quality.

However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal feature representations and limited performance. To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space. Second, recognizing the instability and incompleteness of single graph construction methods, we combine both KNN-based and semi-supervised graph construction approaches on each view, thereby enhancing the robustness of the data structure representation and reducing generalization error. Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-SupGCN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

Key frame sampling is crucial for efficient long-form video understanding.

KFS-Bench addresses the limitation of prior works that only indirectly assess frame selection quality via QA accuracy. By providing ground-truth annotations of multiple disjoint scenes required per question, KFS-Bench allows us to directly analyze how different sampling approaches capture essential content across an entire long video. Using KFS-Bench, we conduct a comprehensive study of key frame sampling methods and identify that not only sampling precision but also scene coverage and sampling balance are the key factors influencing QA performance. Regarding all the factors, we design a novel sampling quality metric that correlates with QA accuracy. Furthermore, we develop a novel key frame sampling method that leverages question-video relevance to balance sampling diversity against question-frame similarity, thereby improving coverage of relevant scenes.

Our framework coordinates specialized foundation models at test time: (1) a $\\textbf{Dreamer}$ that employs generative models to visualize $\\textit{how}$ an interaction would look; (2) a $\\textbf{Thinker}$ that utilizes large vision-language models to decide $\\textit{what}$ object part to interact with; and (3) a $\\textbf{Spotter}$ that orchestrates vision foundation models to precisely locate $\\textit{where}$ the interaction area is. By leveraging the complementary strengths of pre-trained models without any task-specific fine-tuning, our zero-shot framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art supervised methods across multiple benchmarks and demonstrates robust generalization to real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "A4-Agent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u9ad8\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u63a5\u5730\u8026\u5408\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f9d\u8d56\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u65b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) Dreamer\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u4ea4\u4e92\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2) Thinker\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u5b9a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bf9\u8c61\u90e8\u5206\uff1b3) Spotter\u534f\u8c03\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4ea4\u4e92\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u8be5\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u53ef\u4f9b\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Prior work on joint human-scene reconstruction relies on data-driven priors and joint optimization with no physics in the loop, or recovers noisy geometry with artifacts that cause motion tracking policies with scene interactions to fail. In contrast, our key insight is to recover convex, clean, and simulation-ready geometry by fitting planar primitives to a point cloud reconstruction of the scene, via a simple clustering pipeline over depth, normals, and flow. To reconstruct scene geometry that might be occluded during interactions, we make use of human-scene contact modeling (e.g., we use human posture to reconstruct the occluded seat of a chair). Finally, we ensure that human and scene reconstructions are physically-plausible by using them to drive a humanoid controller via reinforcement learning. Our approach reduces motion tracking failure rates from 55.2\\% to 6.9\\% on human-centric video benchmarks (EMDB, PROX), while delivering a 43\\% faster RL simulation throughput. We further validate it on in-the-wild videos including casually-captured videos, Internet videos, and even Sora-generated videos.

However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification.

Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for pretraining these models on large-scale unlabeled image-tabular data, aiming to learn discriminative representations. However, existing SSL methods for image-tabular representation learning are often confined to specific data cohorts, mainly due to their rigid tabular modeling mechanisms when modeling heterogeneous tabular data. This inter-tabular barrier hinders the multi-modal SSL methods from effectively learning transferrable medical knowledge shared across diverse cohorts. In this paper, we propose a novel SSL framework, namely CITab, designed to learn powerful multi-modal feature representations in a cross-tabular manner. We design the tabular modeling mechanism from a semantic-awareness perspective by integrating column headers as semantic cues, which facilitates transferrable knowledge learning and the scalability in utilizing multiple data sources for pretraining. Additionally, we propose a prototype-guided mixture-of-linear layer (P-MoLin) module for tabular feature specialization, empowering the model to effectively handle the heterogeneity of tabular data and explore the underlying medical concepts. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on Alzheimer's disease diagnosis task across three publicly available data cohorts containing 4,461 subjects.

Traditional structured light methods typically decode depth correspondences through pixel-domain matching algorithms, resulting in limited robustness under challenging scenarios like occlusions, fine-structured details, and non-Lambertian surfaces. Inspired by recent advances in neural feature matching, we propose a learning-based structured light decoding framework that performs robust correspondence matching within feature space rather than the fragile pixel domain. Our method extracts neural features from the projected patterns and captured infrared (IR) images, explicitly incorporating their geometric priors by building cost volumes in feature space, achieving substantial performance improvements over pixel-domain decoding approaches. To further enhance depth quality, we introduce a depth refinement module that leverages strong priors from large-scale monocular depth estimation models, improving fine detail recovery and global structural coherence. To facilitate effective learning, we develop a physically-based structured light rendering pipeline, generating nearly one million synthetic pattern-image pairs with diverse objects and materials for indoor settings. Experiments demonstrate that our method, trained exclusively on synthetic data with multiple structured light patterns, generalizes well to real-world indoor environments, effectively processes various pattern types without retraining, and consistently outperforms both commercial structured light systems and passive stereo RGB-based depth estimation methods.

We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem.

For the first time, we explore the use of Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) as the core implicit map representation in a neural SLAM pipeline, a paradigm that trains a lightweight network to directly map 2D image features to 3D global coordinates. SCR networks provide efficient, low-memory 3D map representations, enable extremely fast relocalization, and inherently preserve privacy, making them particularly suitable for neural implicit SLAM.\n  Our system is the first one to achieve strict real-time in neural implicit RGB-D SLAM by relying on a SCR-based representation. We introduce a novel SCR architecture specifically tailored for this purpose and detail the critical design choices required to integrate SCR into a live SLAM pipeline. The resulting framework is simple yet flexible, seamlessly supporting both sparse and dense features, and operates reliably in dynamic environments without special adaptation.

However, the added texture parameters introduce significant memory efficiency challenges. Rather than proposing new texture formulations, we take a step back to examine the characteristics of existing textured Gaussian methods and identify two key limitations in common: (1) Textures are typically defined in canonical space, leading to inefficient sampling that wastes textures' capacity on low-contribution regions; and (2) texture parameterization is uniformly assigned across all Gaussians, regardless of their visual complexity, resulting in over-parameterization. In this work, we address these issues through two simple yet effective strategies: adaptive sampling based on the Gaussian density distribution and error-driven anisotropic parameterization that allocates texture resources according to rendering error. Our proposed ASAP Textured Gaussians, short for Adaptive Sampling and Anisotropic Parameterization, significantly improve the quality efficiency tradeoff, achieving high-fidelity rendering with far fewer texture parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faASAP Textured Gaussians\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u7eb9\u7406\u9ad8\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7eb9\u7406\u9ad8\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff1a(1)\u7eb9\u7406\u5728\u89c4\u8303\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d21\u732e\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u4f4e\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff1b(2)\u7eb9\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5747\u5300\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6240\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\uff0c\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u89c9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8fc7\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6839\u636e\u6e32\u67d3\u8bef\u5dee\u5206\u914d\u7eb9\u7406\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u9a71\u52a8\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3002", "result": "ASAP Textured Gaussians\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u8d28\u91cf\u6548\u7387\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7eb9\u7406\u9ad8\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf3D\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem.

Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made notable progress in automated chart understanding, yet they remain heavily dependent on explicit textual annotations and the performance degrades markedly when key numerals are absent. To address this limitation, we introduce ChartAgent, a chart understanding framework grounded in Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR). Inspired by human cognition, ChartAgent decomposes complex chart analysis into a sequence of observable, replayable steps. Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions. Experiments show that ChartAgent substantially improves robustness under sparse annotation settings, offering a practical path toward trustworthy and extensible systems for chart understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChartAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406(TIR)\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u5c11\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5f53\u5173\u952e\u6570\u503c\u7f3a\u5931\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406(TIR)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u56fe\u8868\u5206\u6790\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5305\u542b\u5173\u952e\u5143\u7d20\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u3001OCR\u7b49\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u6001\u7f16\u6392\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eChartAgent\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u6ce8\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u5305\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8ffd\u6eaf\u548c\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "ChartAgent\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u9ed1\u76d2\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u900f\u660e\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

This failure stems from their reliance on ungrounded, text-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.While existing multi-modal CoT approaches attempt mitigation, they suffer from two fundamental flaws: (1) decoupled perception and reasoning stages that prevent end-to-end joint optimization, and (2) reliance on expensive, dense localization labels.Thus we introduce OmniDrive-R1, an end-to-end VLM framework designed for autonomous driving, which unifies perception and reasoning through an interleaved Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought (iMCoT) mechanism. Our core innovation is an Reinforcement-driven visual grounding capability, enabling the model to autonomously direct its attention and \"zoom in\" on critical regions for fine-grained analysis. This capability is enabled by our pure two-stage reinforcement learning training pipeline and Clip-GRPO algorithm. Crucially, Clip-GRPO introduces an annotation-free, process-based grounding reward.

However, deployment of such solutions is limited by privacy concerns around audio data, sensitivity to background noise, and domain shift across recording environments. We present an end-to-end infant cry analysis pipeline that integrates a denoising autoencoder (DAE), a convolutional tokenizer, and a Transformer encoder trained using communication-efficient federated learning (FL). The system performs on-device denoising, adaptive segmentation, post hoc calibration, and energy-based out-of-distribution (OOD) abstention. Federated training employs a regularized control variate update with 8-bit adapter deltas under secure aggregation. Using the Baby Chillanto and Donate-a-Cry datasets with ESC-50 noise overlays, the model achieves a macro F1 score of 0.938, an AUC of 0.962, and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.032, while reducing per-round client upload from approximately 36 to 42 MB to 3.3 MB. Real-time edge inference on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano (4 GB, TensorRT FP16) achieves 96 ms per one-second spectrogram frame.

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement.

While small-parameter models are progressively endowed with strong general capabilities, standard Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders remain a critical bottleneck, suffering from excessive latency and memory consumption when processing high-resolution inputs.To address these challenges, we introduce HyperVL, an efficient multimodal large language model tailored for on-device inference. HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperVL\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u4e3a\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff08VRC\u548cDCL\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u76f4\u63a5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u3002\u6807\u51c6ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u8fc7\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5757\u7b56\u7565\u9650\u5236\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u79cd\u65b0\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u538b\u7f29\u5668\uff08VRC\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9884\u6d4b\u6700\u4f18\u7f16\u7801\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DCL\uff09\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u5185\u5bf9\u9f50\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6ViT\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u5171\u4eabLLM\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u5207\u6362\u89c6\u89c9\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cHyperVL\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u529f\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperVL\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u767e\u4e07\u7ea7token\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4f7f\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u601d\u8003token\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u8fc5\u901f\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u514b\u670d\u9759\u6001\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587LLM\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5927\u91cf\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u601d\u8003token\uff09\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u514b\u670d\u9759\u6001\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u601d\u8003token\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Qwen3-4B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728LongBench-v2\u548cZeroScrolls\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u5347\u4e8612.6\u548c14.1\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c11\u91cf\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5982\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u591a\u601d\u8003token\uff09\u662f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose viewing both not as separate tasks but as subtasks of a unifying formulation, speech-conditional facial motion infilling. We explore facial motion infilling as a self-supervised pretext task that also serves as a unifying formulation of dynamic talking face synthesis. To instantiate this idea, we propose FacEDiT, a speech-conditional Diffusion Transformer trained with flow matching. Inspired by masked autoencoders, FacEDiT learns to synthesize masked facial motions conditioned on surrounding motions and speech. This formulation enables both localized generation and edits, such as substitution, insertion, and deletion, while ensuring seamless transitions with unedited regions. In addition, biased attention and temporal smoothness constraints enhance boundary continuity and lip synchronization. To address the lack of a standard editing benchmark, we introduce FacEDiTBench, the first dataset for talking face editing, featuring diverse edit types and lengths, along with new evaluation metrics. Extensive experiments validate that talking face editing and generation emerge as subtasks of speech-conditional motion infilling; FacEDiT produces accurate, speech-aligned facial edits with strong identity preservation and smooth visual continuity while generalizing effectively to talking face generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4eba\u8138\u8bf4\u8bdd\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u586b\u5145\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FacEDiT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563Transformer\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u533a\u57df\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u8fc7\u6e21\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\uff0c\u4eba\u8138\u8bf4\u8bdd\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u5b83\u4eec\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u540c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5373\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u586b\u5145\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFacEDiT\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563Transformer\u548c\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5468\u56f4\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5408\u6210\u88ab\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u6ed1\u7ea6\u675f\u589e\u5f3a\u8fb9\u754c\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u5507\u90e8\u540c\u6b65\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFacEDiT\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4eba\u8138\u8bf4\u8bdd\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4eba\u8138\u8bf4\u8bdd\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u97f3\u6761\u4ef6\u8fd0\u52a8\u586b\u5145\u7684\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\uff0cFacEDiT\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss. The results of this research confirm the viability of DL models for climate forecasting, solidifying a global trend in major meteorological and climate forecasting centers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5357\u7f8e\u6d32\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f3a\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578bBAM\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\u7b49\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caCNN 1D\u3001LSTM\u3001GRU\u7b49\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u5df4\u897f\u5168\u7403\u5927\u6c14\u6a21\u578bBAM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\uff0c\u5bf92019\u5e74\u5357\u7f8e\u6d32\u5404\u5b63\u8282\u7684\u964d\u6c34\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u62a5\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "LSTM\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u5f3a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f3a\u964d\u6c34\u9884\u62a5\u65b9\u9762\u6700\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\uff1bBAM\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\uff1bXGBoost\u5728\u6210\u672c\u8003\u8651\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7565\u6709\u635f\u5931\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6c14\u5019\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6c14\u8c61\u548c\u6c14\u5019\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u5168\u7403\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6c14\u8c61\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e8c\u7c92\u5b50\u7ea6\u5316\u5bc6\u5ea6\u77e9\u9635\uff08TD2RDM\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcODE\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8c\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u4e09\u7c92\u5b50\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6a21\u62df\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u8054\u533a\u57df\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4e09\u7c92\u5b50\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u975e\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5b50\u591a\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u5173\u8054\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22TD2RDM\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c40\u57df\u91cd\u6784\u51fd\u6570\u5ffd\u7565\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcODE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7cbe\u786e\u76842RDM\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u964d\u7ef4\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u4e09\u7c92\u5b50\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8c\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u4e09\u7c92\u5b50\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u7684\u76ae\u5c14\u900a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcODE\u4ec5\u5728\u4e8c\u7c92\u5b50\u548c\u4e09\u7c92\u5b50\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u533a\u57df\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u518d\u73b0\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff1b\u5728\u53cd\u76f8\u5173\u6216\u65e0\u5173\u8054\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u6548\uff1b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u4e09\u7c92\u5b50\u5173\u8054\u5efa\u7acb\u5e45\u5ea6\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u6210\u529f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edcODE\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6620\u5c04\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u5c55\u5f00\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9002\u7528\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u5bfc\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u95ed\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff1b\u5b66\u4e60\u9ad8\u7ef4RDM\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\u5b50\u7269\u8d28\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose CODSR, a controllable one-step diffusion network for image super-resolution. First, we propose an LQ-guided feature modulation module that leverages original uncompressed information from LQ inputs to provide high-fidelity conditioning for the diffusion process. We then develop a region-adaptive generative prior activation method to effectively enhance perceptual richness without sacrificing local structural fidelity. Finally, we employ a text-matching guidance strategy to fully harness the conditioning potential of text prompts.

However, its practical adoption has been limited by high training cost, slow convergence, and instability, which have so far kept it behind strong autoregressive (AR) baselines. We present \\textbf{SDAR-VL}, the first systematic application of block-wise discrete diffusion to large-scale vision-language understanding (VLU), together with an \\emph{integrated framework for efficient and stable training}. This framework unifies three components: (1) \\textbf{Asynchronous Block-wise Noise Scheduling} to diversify supervision within each batch; (2) \\textbf{Effective Mask Ratio Scaling} for unbiased loss normalization under stochastic masking; and (3) a \\textbf{Progressive Beta Noise Curriculum} that increases effective mask coverage while preserving corruption diversity. Experiments on 21 single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks show that SDAR-VL consistently improves \\emph{training efficiency}, \\emph{convergence stability}, and \\emph{task performance} over conventional block diffusion.

While 3DGS exhibits robust reconstruction of scene appearance for novel-view synthesis, it lacks structural representations underlying those appearances (e.g., branching patterns of plants), which limits its applicability to tasks such as plant phenotyping. To achieve both high-fidelity appearance and structural reconstruction, we introduce GaussianPlant, a hierarchical 3DGS representation, which disentangles structure and appearance. Specifically, we employ structure primitives (StPs) to explicitly represent branch and leaf geometry, and appearance primitives (ApPs) to the plants' appearance using 3D Gaussians. StPs represent a simplified structure of the plant, i.e., modeling branches as cylinders and leaves as disks. To accurately distinguish the branches and leaves, StP's attributes (i.e., branches or leaves) are optimized in a self-organized manner. ApPs are bound to each StP to represent the appearance of branches or leaves as in conventional 3DGS. StPs and ApPs are jointly optimized using a re-rendering loss on the input multi-view images, as well as the gradient flow from ApP to StP using the binding correspondence information. We conduct experiments to qualitatively evaluate the reconstruction accuracy of both appearance and structure, as well as real-world experiments to qualitatively validate the practical performance.

These models extend traditional message-passing GNNs and Transformers by representing node and edge features as spherical tensors that transform under irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3), ensuring that predictions change in physically meaningful ways under rotations of the input. This guide develops a complete, intuitive foundation for spherical equivariant modeling - from group representations and spherical harmonics, to tensor products, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition, and the construction of SO(3)-equivariant kernels. Building on this foundation, we construct the Tensor Field Network and SE(3)-Transformer architectures and explain how they perform equivariant message-passing and attention on geometric graphs. Through clear mathematical derivations and annotated code excerpts, this guide serves as a self-contained introduction for researchers and learners seeking to understand or implement spherical EGNNs for applications in chemistry, molecular property prediction, protein structure modeling, and generative modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7403\u9762\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc(EGNNs)\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u5357\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caTensor Field Network\u548cSE(3)-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u5206\u5b50\u548c\u751f\u7269\u5206\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u5fc5\u987b\u5c0a\u91cd\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301SO(3)\u65cb\u8f6c\u7fa4\u7b49\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8282\u70b9\u548c\u8fb9\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7403\u9762\u5f20\u91cf\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u53ef\u7ea6\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7403\u8c10\u51fd\u6570\u3001\u5f20\u91cf\u79ef\u548cClebsch-Gordan\u5206\u89e3\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6784\u5efaSO(3)-\u7b49\u53d8\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b49\u53d8\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Tensor Field Network\u548cSE(3)-Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u7b49\u53d8\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u65cb\u8f6c\u65f6\u4ee5\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6307\u5357\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u81ea\u5305\u542b\u7684\u7403\u9762\u7b49\u53d8\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ecb\u7ecd\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5316\u5b66\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

While scene graphs offer a structured abstraction of surgical events, their full potential remains untapped. In this work, we introduce ProtoFlow, a novel framework that learns dynamic scene graph prototypes to model complex surgical workflows in an interpretable and robust manner.\n  Methods: ProtoFlow leverages a graph neural network (GNN) encoder-decoder architecture that combines self-supervised pretraining for rich representation learning with a prototype-based fine-tuning stage. This process discovers and refines core prototypes that encapsulate recurring, clinically meaningful patterns of surgical interaction, forming an explainable foundation for workflow analysis.\n  Results: We evaluate our approach on the fine-grained CAT-SG dataset. ProtoFlow not only outperforms standard GNN baselines in overall accuracy but also demonstrates exceptional robustness in limited-data, few-shot scenarios, maintaining strong performance when trained on as few as one surgical video. Our qualitative analyses further show that the learned prototypes successfully identify distinct surgical sub-techniques and provide clear, interpretable insights into workflow deviations and rare complications.\n  Conclusion: By uniting robust representation learning with inherent explainability, ProtoFlow represents a significant step toward developing more transparent, reliable, and data-efficient AI systems, accelerating their potential for clinical adoption in surgical training, real-time decision support, and workflow optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProtoFlow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u539f\u578b\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u624b\u672f\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u624b\u672f\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u800c\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u62bd\u8c61\u624b\u672f\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u6316\u6398\u3002", "method": "ProtoFlow\u91c7\u7528\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u63d0\u70bc\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u578b\u6765\u5c01\u88c5\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u624b\u672f\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CAT-SG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cProtoFlow\u4e0d\u4ec5\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6GNN\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u624b\u672f\u89c6\u9891\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u539f\u578b\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u624b\u672f\u5b50\u6280\u672f\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u504f\u5dee\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5185\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fc8\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u52a0\u901f\u5176\u5728\u624b\u672f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u4ee3\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528LLM\u548c\u5316\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u6811\u72b6\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u5206\u5b50\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u83b7\u53d6\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u6548\u5019\u9009\u9009\u62e9\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86LLM\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u53d1\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present a predictive, quality-aware framework that integrates heterogeneous signal sources with dynamic assessment of reliability. Ten signals are extracted from facial remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), upper-body motion, and deep learning pipelines, and analyzed using four spectral estimators: Welch's method, Multiple Signal Classification (MUSIC), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), and peak detection. Segment-level quality indices are then used to train machine learning models that predict accuracy or select the most reliable signal.

By guiding predictions with this pattern estimate, PGDM makes more realistic predictions that fit within the set of known patterns. We additionally introduce a novel uncertainty quantification technique based on archetypal analysis, and we dynamically scale the guidance level based on the pattern estimate uncertainty.

To overcome this, recent approaches attempt zero-shot 4D HOI generation with pre-trained image diffusion models. However, interaction cues are minimally distilled during the generation process, restricting their applicability across diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose AnchorHOI, a novel framework that thoroughly exploits hybrid priors by incorporating video diffusion models beyond image diffusion models, advancing 4D HOI generation. Nevertheless, directly optimizing high-dimensional 4D HOI with such priors remains challenging, particularly for human pose and compositional motion. To address this challenge, AnchorHOI introduces an anchor-based prior distillation strategy, which constructs interaction-aware anchors and then leverages them to guide generation in a tractable two-step process. Specifically, two tailored anchors are designed for 4D HOI generation: anchor Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) for expressive interaction composition, and anchor keypoints for realistic motion synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnchorHOI outperforms previous methods with superior diversity and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "AnchorHOI\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u951a\u70b9\u5148\u9a8c\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u76844D\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u70b9\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u76844D\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\uff0c\u800c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u53d6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u951a\u70b9\u5148\u9a8c\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u70b9\uff1b2\uff09\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u951a\u70b9NeRF\u548c\u7528\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u8fd0\u52a8\u5408\u6210\u7684\u951a\u70b9\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eAnchorHOI\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "AnchorHOI\u901a\u8fc7\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u951a\u70b9\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e864D\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work we present a new approach to such crystallographic symmetries by developing a single machine learning architecture that is capable of adapting its weights automatically to enforce invariance to any input space group. Our approach is based on constructing symmetry-adapted Fourier bases through an explicit characterization of constraints that group operations impose on Fourier coefficients. Encoding these constraints into a neural network layer enables weight sharing across different space groups, allowing the model to leverage structural similarities between groups and overcome data sparsity when limited measurements are available for specific groups.

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) significantly enhances generation quality and controllability but doubles the computation by requiring both conditional and unconditional forward passes at every timestep. We present OUSAC (Optimized gUidance Scheduling with Adaptive Caching), a framework that accelerates diffusion transformers (DiT) through systematic optimization. Our key insight is that variable guidance scales enable sparse computation: adjusting scales at certain timesteps can compensate for skipping CFG at others, enabling both fewer total sampling steps and fewer CFG steps while maintaining quality. However, variable guidance patterns introduce denoising deviations that undermine standard caching methods, which assume constant CFG scales across steps. Moreover, different transformer blocks are affected at different levels under dynamic conditions. This paper develops a two-stage approach leveraging these insights.

However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework.

Existing approaches typically rely on 3D-aware architectures or specialized diffusion models that require extensive multi-view training data and complex geometric priors. In this work, we introduce ViewMask-1-to-3, a pioneering approach to apply discrete diffusion models to multi-view image generation. Unlike continuous diffusion methods that operate in latent spaces, ViewMask-1-to-3 formulates multi-view synthesis as a discrete sequence modeling problem, where each viewpoint is represented as visual tokens obtained through MAGVIT-v2 tokenization. By unifying language and vision through masked token prediction, our approach enables progressive generation of multiple viewpoints through iterative token unmasking with text input. ViewMask-1-to-3 achieves cross-view consistency through simple random masking combined with self-attention, eliminating the requirement for complex 3D geometric constraints or specialized attention architectures.

However, limited explainability and poor handling of complex spatial relations remain key challenges for real-world use. To address these issues, we introduce RUNE (Reasoning Using Neurosymbolic Entities), an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with neurosymbolic AI to retrieve images by reasoning over the compatibility between detected entities and First-Order Logic (FOL) expressions derived from text queries. Unlike RS-LVLMs that rely on implicit joint embeddings, RUNE performs explicit reasoning, enhancing performance and interpretability. For scalability, we propose a logic decomposition strategy that operates on conditioned subsets of detected entities, guaranteeing shorter execution time compared to neural approaches. Rather than using foundation models for end-to-end retrieval, we leverage them only to generate FOL expressions, delegating reasoning to a neurosymbolic inference module. For evaluation we repurpose the DOTA dataset, originally designed for object detection, by augmenting it with more complex queries than in existing benchmarks. We show the LLM's effectiveness in text-to-logic translation and compare RUNE with state-of-the-art RS-LVLMs, demonstrating superior performance. We introduce two metrics, Retrieval Robustness to Query Complexity (RRQC) and Retrieval Robustness to Image Uncertainty (RRIU), which evaluate performance relative to query complexity and image uncertainty. RUNE outperforms joint-embedding models in complex RS retrieval tasks, offering gains in performance, robustness, and explainability.

Existing approaches typically model MTS data in either Euclidean or Riemannian space, limiting their ability to capture the diverse geometric structures and complex spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in real-world data. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Symmetric Positive-Definite Manifold Graph Neural Network (HSMGNN), a novel graph neural network-based model that captures data geometry within a hybrid Euclidean-Riemannian framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage hybrid geometric representations for MTS forecasting, enabling expressive and comprehensive modeling of geometric properties. Specifically, we introduce a Submanifold-Cross-Segment (SCS) embedding to project input MTS into both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, thereby capturing spatio-temporal variations across distinct geometric domains. To alleviate the high computational cost of Riemannian distance, we further design an Adaptive-Distance-Bank (ADB) layer with a trainable memory mechanism. Finally, a Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN) is devised to integrate features from the dual spaces via a learnable fusion operator for accurate prediction.

However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or \"unlearning\") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7684CLIP\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u79cd\u9057\u5fd8\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u5168\u5c40\u9057\u5fd8\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9886\u57df\u5b8c\u5168\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u79fb\u9664\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\u800c\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u5176\u4ed6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548cCLIP\u8054\u5408\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u539f\u578b\u534f\u540c\u6574\u5408\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u79fb\u9664\u6307\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e0\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable progress in these areas in recent years, constructing an efficient, multi-task compatible, and generalizable unified framework for time series analysis remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis. To ameliorate these challenges, we propose FusAD, a unified analysis framework designed for diverse time series tasks. FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments. In addition, the framework integrates a general information fusion and decoding structure, combined with masked pre-training, to promote efficient learning and transfer of multi-granularity representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FusAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on mainstream time series benchmarks for classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often results in unsatisfactory recognition performance. To address these issues, existing methods train independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for different color channels to remove shadows and noise, which, in turn, facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, deploying multiple GANs results in long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of document image enhancement and binarization models, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and we conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets demonstrate that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase.

Recent advances of Large Language Models (LMMs) and motion analysis techniques provide new opportunities to address the above limitations. In this paper, we propose SportsGPT, an LLM-driven framework for interpretable sports motion assessment and training guidance, which establishes a closed loop from motion time-series input to professional training guidance. First, given a set of high-quality target models, we introduce MotionDTW, a two-stage time series alignment algorithm designed for accurate keyframe extraction from skeleton-based motion sequences. Subsequently, we design a Knowledge-based Interpretable Sports Motion Assessment Model (KISMAM) to obtain a set of interpretable assessment metrics (e.g., insufficient extension) by constrasting the keyframes with the targe models. Finally, we propose SportsRAG, a RAG-based training guidance model based on Qwen3. Leveraging a 6B-token knowledge base, it prompts the LLM to generate professional training guidance by retrieving domain-specific QA pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that MotionDTW significantly outperforms traditional methods with lower temporal error and higher IoU scores. Furthermore, ablation studies validate the KISMAM and SportsRAG, confirming that SportsGPT surpasses general LLMs in diagnostic accuracy and professionalism.", "AI": {"tldr": "SportsGPT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MotionDTW\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6\u3001KISMAM\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u548cSportsRAG\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e8f\u5217\u8f93\u5165\u5230\u4e13\u4e1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80b2\u5206\u6790\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\"\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\"\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5bfc\u3002LLM\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002", "method": "1.

A DIFNO is an FNO trained by minimizing its prediction error jointly on output and Fr\u00e9chet derivative samples of a high-fidelity operator (e.g., a parametric PDE solution operator). As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fr\u00e9chet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fr\u00e9chet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fr\u00e9chet derivative learning.

Unlike prior methods that rely on discrete tracking or view-dependent features, our approach disentangles visibility from persistent object identity by modeling each space-time point with an occupancy probability and a conditional instance distribution. To realize this, we introduce a novel instance-embedded representation based on deformable 3D Gaussians, which jointly encode radiance and semantic information and are learned directly from input RGB images and instance masks through differentiable rasterization. Furthermore, we introduce new mechanisms to calibrate per-Gaussian identities and resample Gaussians toward semantically active regions, ensuring consistent instance representations across space and time. Experiments on HyperNeRF and Neu3D datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on novel-view panoptic segmentation and open-vocabulary 4D querying tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u573a\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6982\u7387\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u53d8\u5f623D\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u8f90\u5c04\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u63a9\u7801\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u56fe\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c474D\u67e5\u8be2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u6563\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6216\u89c6\u89d2\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8868\u793a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u8026\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u4e0e\u6301\u4e45\u5bf9\u8c61\u8eab\u4efd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bc6\u522b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u53d8\u5f623D\u9ad8\u65af\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7a\u70b9\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5360\u636e\u6982\u7387\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u9ad8\u65af\u8eab\u4efd\u6821\u51c6\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9762\u5411\u8bed\u4e49\u6d3b\u8dc3\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728HyperNeRF\u548cNeu3D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u578b\u89c6\u56fe\u5168\u666f\u5206\u5272\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c474D\u67e5\u8be2\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e00\u81f4\u5b9e\u4f8b\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u65f6\u7a7a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b9e\u4f8b\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We present SketchAssist, an interactive sketch drawing assistant that accelerates creation by unifying instruction-guided global edits with line-guided region redrawing, while keeping unrelated regions and overall composition intact. To enable this assistant at scale, we introduce a controllable data generation pipeline that (i) constructs attribute-addition sequences from attribute-free base sketches, (ii) forms multi-step edit chains via cross-sequence sampling, and (iii) expands stylistic coverage with a style-preserving attribute-removal model applied to diverse sketches. Building on this data, SketchAssist employs a unified sketch editing framework with minimal changes to DiT-based editors. We repurpose the RGB channels to encode the inputs, enabling seamless switching between instruction-guided edits and line-guided redrawing within a single input interface.

However, the quality and stability of the trained reward model largely determine the final alignment performance. Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors.\n  In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences. Since real-world questions can be interpreted from multiple perspectives, to ensure that logic-based reinforcement learning does not cause model collapse, we introduce S-GRPO, a supervised variant of the GRPO framework. S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training.\n  Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness. Furthermore, it extends existing preference-learning frameworks such as GRPO and DPO, offering a more flexible and task-adaptive approach to alignment training.

Despite their practical effectiveness,existing methods are inherently limited in both capability and robustness due to their dependence on single-trigger-single-object mappings and fragile pixel-level cues. We propose CIS-BA, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that redefines trigger design by shifting from static object features to continuous inter-object interaction patterns that describe how objects co-occur and interact in a scene. By modeling these patterns as a continuous interaction space, CIS-BA introduces space triggers that, for the first time, enable a multi-trigger-multi-object attack mechanism while achieving robustness through invariant geometric relations. To implement this paradigm, we design CIS-Frame, which constructs space triggers via interaction analysis, formalizes them as class-geometry constraints for sample poisoning, and embeds the backdoor during detector training. CIS-Frame supports both single-object attacks (object misclassification and disappearance) and multi-object simultaneous attacks, enabling complex and coordinated effects across diverse interaction states. Experiments on MS-COCO and real-world videos show that CIS-BA achieves over 97% attack success under complex environments and maintains over 95% effectiveness under dynamic multi-trigger conditions, while evading three state-of-the-art defenses. In summary, CIS-BA extends the landscape of backdoor attacks in interaction-intensive scenarios and provides new insights into the security of object detection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "CIS-BA\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4ece\u9759\u6001\u5bf9\u8c61\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668-\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u653b\u51fb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5355\u89e6\u53d1\u5668-\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCIS-Frame\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7c7b\u51e0\u4f55\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdb\u884c\u6837\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u5d4c\u5165\u540e\u95e8\u3002\u652f\u6301\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u6d88\u5931\uff09\u548c\u591a\u5bf9\u8c61\u540c\u65f6\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728MS-COCO\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCIS-BA\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc797%\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u89e6\u53d1\u5668\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u8d85\u8fc795%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u9003\u907f\u4e09\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CIS-BA\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

Despite the rapid progress in 3D HPE, existing methods are typically trained and evaluated under disparate frameworks, lacking a unified framework for fair comparison. To address these limitations, we propose Fast3DHPE, a modular framework that facilitates rapid reproduction and flexible development of new methods. By standardizing training and evaluation protocols, Fast3DHPE enables fair comparison across 3D human pose estimation methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this framework, we introduce FastDDHPose, a Disentangled Diffusion-based 3D Human Pose Estimation method which leverages the strong latent distribution modeling capability of diffusion models to explicitly model the distributions of bone length and bone direction while avoiding further amplification of hierarchical error accumulation. Moreover, we design an efficient Kinematic-Hierarchical Spatial and Temporal Denoiser that encourages the model to focus on kinematic joint hierarchies while avoiding unnecessary modeling of overly complex joint topologies. Extensive experiments on Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP show that the Fast3DHPE framework enables fair comparison of all methods while significantly improving training efficiency. Within this unified framework, FastDDHPose achieves state-of-the-art performance with strong generalization and robustness in in-the-wild scenarios.

Among various optimization-based attacks, the gradient-based PGD and the momentum-based MI-FGSM have garnered considerable interest. However, all these attacks use the sign function to scale their perturbations, which raises several theoretical concerns from the point of view of optimization. In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad. Motivated by this analysis, we present a novel momentum-based attack AdaMI, in which the perturbation is optimized with an interesting momentum-based adaptive matrix. AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed momentum-based adaptive matrix can serve as a general and effective technique to boost adversarial transferability over the state-of-the-art methods across different networks while maintaining better stability and imperceptibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5AdaMI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u975e\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982PGD\u548cMI-FGSM\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u7b26\u53f7\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u7f29\u653e\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u4e86PGD\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u4f7f\u7528\u7d2f\u79ef\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e9\u9635\u65f6\uff0cPGD\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u53d8\u6210\u4e86AdaGrad\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86AdaMI\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u6270\u52a8\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MI-FGSM\u7684\u975e\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e9\u9635\u80fd\u591f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u53ef\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AdaMI\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u91cf\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u77e9\u9635\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u653b\u51fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent work on semantic uncertainty estimates relies on external models to cluster multiple sampled responses and measure their semantic consistency. However, these clustering methods are often fragile, highly sensitive to minor phrasing variations, and can incorrectly group or separate semantically similar answers, leading to unreliable uncertainty estimates. We propose Semantic Gaussian Process Uncertainty (SGPU), a Bayesian framework that quantifies semantic uncertainty by analyzing the geometric structure of answer embeddings, avoiding brittle clustering. SGPU maps generated answers into a dense semantic space, computes the Gram matrix of their embeddings, and summarizes their semantic configuration via the eigenspectrum. This spectral representation is then fed into a Gaussian Process Classifier that learns to map patterns of semantic consistency to predictive uncertainty, and that can be applied in both black-box and white-box settings. Across six LLMs and LVLMs on eight datasets spanning VQA, image classification, and textual QA, SGPU consistently achieves state-of-the-art calibration (ECE) and discriminative (AUROC, AUARC) performance.

We show how one can start from general probabilistic statements and then branch out into specific representations for learning and simulation algorithms in terms of information processing.

SH struggle with high-frequency signals, exhibit Gibbs ringing artifacts, and fail to capture specular reflections - a key component of realistic rendering. Although alternatives like spherical Gaussians offer improvements, they add significant optimization complexity. We propose Spherical Voronoi (SV) as a unified framework for appearance representation in 3D Gaussian Splatting. SV partitions the directional domain into learnable regions with smooth boundaries, providing an intuitive and stable parameterization for view-dependent effects.

Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincar\u00e9 Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%.

A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection.

However, real-world large-scale captures are often based on multi-temporal data capture, where illumination inconsistencies across different times of day can significantly lead to color artifacts, geometric inaccuracies, and inconsistent appearance. Due to the lack of UAV datasets that systematically capture the same areas under varying illumination conditions, this challenge remains largely underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduceSkyLume, a large-scale, real-world UAV dataset specifically designed for studying illumination robust 3D reconstruction in urban scene modeling: (1) We collect data from 10 urban regions data comprising more than 100k high resolution UAV images (four oblique views and nadir), where each region is captured at three periods of the day to systematically isolate illumination changes.

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u6027\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u5c5e\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u878d\u5165\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff08\u5982\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u6027\uff09\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fee\u6539\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53cd\u5e94\u9879\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u8d28\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u548c\u51c6\u6b63\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u975e\u8d1f\u6027\u5e76\u9075\u5b88\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u6536\u655b\u5230\u552f\u4e00\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u4e0e\u57fa\u672c\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u6b63\u51fd\u6570\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE).

Yet most prior systems model human behavior as a translation task co-speech gesture or text-to-motion that maps a fixed utterance to motion clips-without requiring agentic decision-making about when to move, what to do, or how to adapt across multi-turn dialogue. This leads to brittle timing, weak social grounding, and fragmented stacks where speech, text, and motion are trained or inferred in isolation. We introduce ViBES (Voice in Behavioral Expression and Synchrony), a conversational 3D agent that jointly plans language and movement and executes dialogue-conditioned body actions. Concretely, ViBES is a speech-language-behavior (SLB) model with a mixture-of-modality-experts (MoME) backbone: modality-partitioned transformer experts for speech, facial expression, and body motion. The model processes interleaved multimodal token streams with hard routing by modality (parameters are split per expert), while sharing information through cross-expert attention. By leveraging strong pretrained speech-language models, the agent supports mixed-initiative interaction: users can speak, type, or issue body-action directives mid-conversation, and the system exposes controllable behavior hooks for streaming responses. We further benchmark on multi-turn conversation with automatic metrics of dialogue-motion alignment and behavior quality, and observe consistent gains over strong co-speech and text-to-motion baselines. ViBES goes beyond \"speech-conditioned motion generation\" toward agentic virtual bodies where language, prosody, and movement are jointly generated, enabling controllable, socially competent 3D interaction.

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework to generate 4D radar point clouds for training and evaluating object detectors. Unlike image-based diffusion, our method is designed to consider the sparsity and unique characteristics of radar point clouds by applying diffusion to a latent point cloud representation. Within this latent space, generation is controlled via conditioning at either the object or scene level. The proposed 4D-RaDiff converts unlabeled bounding boxes into high-quality radar annotations and transforms existing LiDAR point cloud data into realistic radar scenes. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating synthetic radar data of 4D-RaDiff as data augmentation method during training consistently improves object detection performance compared to training on real data only.

Existing approaches to learning such dynamics typically either discretize time -- leading to poor performance on irregularly sampled data -- or ignore the underlying causality. We propose CaDyT, a novel method for causal discovery on dynamical systems addressing both these challenges. In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process. We propose a practical instantiation that identifies the causal structure via a greedy search guided by the Algorithmic Markov Condition and Minimum Description Length principle.

Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks.

Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_\u03c6$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

Although significant progress has been made through large-scale driver attention datasets and deep learning architectures, existing works are constrained by narrow frontal field-of-view and limited driving diversity. Consequently, they fail to capture the full spatial context of driving environments, especially during lane changes, turns, and interactions involving peripheral objects such as pedestrians or cyclists. In this paper, we introduce DriverGaze360, a large-scale 360$^\\circ$ field of view driver attention dataset, containing $\\sim$1 million gaze-labeled frames collected from 19 human drivers, enabling comprehensive omnidirectional modeling of driver gaze behavior. Moreover, our panoramic attention prediction approach, DriverGaze360-Net, jointly learns attention maps and attended objects by employing an auxiliary semantic segmentation head. This improves spatial awareness and attention prediction across wide panoramic inputs.

Our method addresses the limits of GRPO for the GVQA task with two key innovations: (i) a zoom-in accuracy reward that validates the fidelity of temporal grounding prediction and facilitates fine-grained visual verification on grounded frames; (ii) token-selective credit assignment, which attributes rewards to the tokens responsible for temporal localization or answer generation, mitigating GRPO's issue in handling multi-faceted reward signals. Our proposed method advances grounded video question answering, improving temporal grounding by 5.2\\% on NExT-GQA and 4.6\\% on ReXTime, while also enhancing average answer accuracy by 2.4\\%. Additionally, the coarse-to-fine zoom-in during inference further benefits long-form video understanding by preserving critical visual details without compromising global context, yielding an average improvement of 6.4\\% on long-video benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Zoom-Zero\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5148\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7247\u6bb5\u518d\u653e\u5927\u5230\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709GVQA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eGRPO\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6539\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u96be\u4ee5\u5fe0\u5b9e\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u8bc1\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65f6\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faZoom-Zero\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u653e\u5927\u5230\u6700\u663e\u8457\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u7f29\u653e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u9009\u62e9\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728NExT-GQA\u4e0a\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u53475.2%\uff0c\u5728ReXTime\u4e0a\u63d0\u53474.6%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53472.4%\u3002\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "Zoom-Zero\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GVQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u7c97\u5230\u7ec6\u7684\u653e\u5927\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Therefore, this paper proposes GRAFT (GRid-Aware Forecasting with Text), which modifies and improves STanHOP to better support grid-aware forecasting and multi-source textual interventions. Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment. We construct and release a unified aligned benchmark covering 2019--2021 for five Australian states (half-hour load, daily-aligned weather/calendar variables, and three categories of external texts), and conduct systematic, reproducible evaluations at three scales -- hourly, daily, and monthly -- under a unified protocol for comparison across regions, external sources, and time scales. Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out.

We introduce a Dual-Axis Representation-Complete Convergent Learning (RCCL) strategy, enabled by a molecular representation that integrates graph convolutional network (GCN) encoding of local valence environments, grounded in modern valence bond theory, together with no-bridge graph (NBG) encoding of ring/cage topologies, providing a quantitative measure of chemical-space coverage. This framework formalizes representation completeness, establishing a principled basis for constructing datasets that support convergent learning for large models. Guided by this RCCL framework, we develop the FD25 dataset, systematically covering 13,302 local valence units and 165,726 ring/cage topologies, achieving near-complete combinatorial coverage of organic molecules with H/C/N/O/F elements. Graph neural networks trained on FD25 exhibit representation-complete convergent learning and strong out-of-distribution generalization, with an overall prediction error of approximately 1.0 kcal/mol MAE across external benchmarks. Our results establish a quantitative link between molecular representation, structural completeness, and model generalization, providing a foundation for interpretable, transferable, and data-efficient molecular intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u8f74\u8868\u793a-\u5b8c\u5168\u6536\u655b\u5b66\u4e60(RCCL)\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc(GCN)\u7f16\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u4ef7\u73af\u5883\u548c\u65e0\u6865\u56fe(NBG)\u7f16\u7801\u73af/\u7b3c\u62d3\u6251\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6536\u655b\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86FD25\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8868\u793a\u5b8c\u5168\u6536\u655b\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5316\u5b66\u7a7a\u95f4(10^30-10^60\u89c4\u6a21)\u4e2d\u80fd\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u6536\u655b\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e00\u5f00\u653e\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u8f74RCCL\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) GCN\u7f16\u7801\u5c40\u90e8\u4ef7\u73af\u5883(\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u4ef7\u952e\u7406\u8bba)\uff1b2) NBG\u7f16\u7801\u73af/\u7b3c\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u5f00\u53d1FD25\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8986\u76d613,302\u4e2a\u5c40\u90e8\u4ef7\u5355\u5143\u548c165,726\u4e2a\u73af/\u7b3c\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "result": "\u5728FD25\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8868\u793a\u5b8c\u5168\u6536\u655b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5728\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u7ea6\u4e3a1.0 kcal/mol MAE\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5206\u5b50\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u667a\u80fd\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

The system demonstrates greater stability and accuracy with relaxation to prior perturbation (RTPP) than with relaxation to prior spread (RTPS), while NWP models tend to be more stable with RTPS. RTPP replaces an analysis perturbation with a weighted blend of analysis and background perturbations, whereas RTPS simply rescales the analysis perturbation.

However, most existing frameworks focus on global alignment and struggle to capture the hierarchical, multi-scale lesion patterns characteristic of plant disease imagery. To address this gap, we propose PSMamba, a progressive self-supervised framework that integrates the efficient sequence modelling of Vision Mamba (VM) with a dual-student hierarchical distillation strategy. Unlike conventional single teacher-student designs, PSMamba employs a shared global teacher and two specialised students: one processes mid-scale views to capture lesion distributions and vein structures, while the other focuses on local views to capture fine-grained cues such as texture irregularities and early-stage lesions. This multi-granular supervision facilitates the joint learning of contextual and detailed representations, with consistency losses ensuring coherent cross-scale alignment. Experiments on three benchmark datasets show that PSMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SSL methods, delivering superior accuracy and robustness in both domain-shifted and fine-grained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "PSMamba\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Vision Mamba\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u53cc\u5b66\u751f\u5c42\u6b21\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u75c5\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u7279\u6709\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u75c5\u53d8\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5171\u4eab\u5168\u5c40\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u53cc\u5b66\u751f\u5c42\u6b21\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89c6\u56fe\u6355\u6349\u75c5\u53d8\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8109\u7edc\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u5904\u7406\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u56fe\u6355\u6349\u7eb9\u7406\u5f02\u5e38\u548c\u65e9\u671f\u75c5\u53d8\u7b49\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPSMamba\u5728\u9886\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "PSMamba\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u690d\u7269\u75c5\u5bb3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u5f0f\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring.

This study presents a structured methodology for VLM comparison, divided into zero-shot and few-shot streams specifically to identify WWTPs. The YOLOv8 was trained on a governmental dataset of 83,566 high-resolution satellite images from Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and UAE: ~85% WWTPs (positives), 15% non-WWTPs (negatives). Evaluated VLMs include LLaMA 3.2 Vision, Qwen 2.5 VL, DeepSeek-VL2, Gemma 3, Gemini, and Pixtral 12B (Mistral), used to identify WWTP components such as circular/rectangular tanks, aeration basins and distinguish confounders via expert prompts producing JSON outputs with confidence and descriptions. The dataset comprises 1,207 validated WWTP locations (198 UAE, 354 KSA, 655 Egypt) and equal non-WWTP sites from field/AI data, as 600mx600m Geo-TIFF images (Zoom 18, EPSG:4326). Zero-shot evaluations on WWTP images showed several VLMs out-performing YOLOv8's true positive rate, with Gemma-3 highest.

In this work, we introduce Kinetic-Mamba, a Mamba-based neural operator framework that integrates the expressive power of neural operators with the efficient temporal modeling capabilities of Mamba architectures. The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold.

Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance.

While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions.

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u591a\u901a\u9053\u5fc3\u623f\u7535\u56fe\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u4e13\u7528VAE\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6VAE\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fc3\u623f\u98a4\u52a8\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5fc3\u5f8b\u5931\u5e38\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u5fc3\u623f\u7535\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6210\u50cf\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d7\u5230\u914d\u5bf9\u4f53\u8868\u7535\u4f4d-\u5fc3\u5185\u7535\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6a21\u578b\uff1aVAE-S\uff08\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u4e13\u7528\uff09\u548cVAE-C\uff08\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7aa6\u6027\u5fc3\u5f8b\u548c\u623f\u98a4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u3001\u9891\u8c31\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "VAE-S\u5728\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u800cVAE-C\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u8282\u5f8b\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u7aa6\u6027\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e0b\u6e38\u975e\u4fb5\u5165\u6027\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8eVAE\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u6210\u50cf\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u810f\u7535\u751f\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Yet automating the animation of vector graphics remains challenging for vision-language models (VLMs) despite recent progress in code generation and motion planning. VLMs routinely mis-handle SVGs, since visually coherent parts are often fragmented into low-level shapes that offer little guidance of which elements should move together. In this paper, we introduce a framework that recovers the semantic structure required for reliable SVG animation and reveals the missing layer that current VLM systems overlook. This is achieved through a statistical aggregation of multiple weak part predictions, allowing the system to stably infer semantics from noisy predictions. By reorganizing SVGs into semantic groups, our approach enables VLMs to produce animations with far greater coherence. Our experiments demonstrate substantial gains over existing approaches, suggesting that semantic recovery is the key step that unlocks robust SVG animation and supports more interpretable interactions between VLMs and vector graphics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u6062\u590d\u6765\u6539\u8fdbSVG\u52a8\u753b\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406SVG\u52a8\u753b\u65f6\u56e0\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u5f62\u72b6\u788e\u7247\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7406\u89e3\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406SVG\u52a8\u753b\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u5206\u5272\u6210\u4f4e\u5c42\u6b21\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u54ea\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u5e94\u8be5\u4e00\u8d77\u79fb\u52a8\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5f31\u90e8\u5206\u9884\u6d4b\u6765\u6062\u590dSVG\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06SVG\u91cd\u65b0\u7ec4\u7ec7\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3aVLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728SVG\u52a8\u753b\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u6062\u590d\u662f\u89e3\u9501\u7a33\u5065SVG\u52a8\u753b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u652f\u6301VLMs\u4e0e\u77e2\u91cf\u56fe\u5f62\u4e4b\u95f4\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002"}}

However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable.

Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability.

The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features.

Existing approaches have advanced dynamic NVS by introducing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with implicit deformation fields or indiscriminately assigned time-varying parameters, surpassing NeRF-based methods. However, due to excessive model complexity and parameter redundancy, they incur large model sizes and slow rendering speeds, making them inefficient for real-time applications, particularly on resource-constrained devices. To obtain a more efficient model with fewer redundant parameters, in this paper, we propose Hybrid Gaussian Splatting (HGS), a compact and efficient framework explicitly designed to disentangle static and dynamic regions of a scene within a unified representation. The core innovation of HGS lies in our Static-Dynamic Decomposition (SDD) strategy, which leverages Radial Basis Function (RBF) modeling for Gaussian primitives. Specifically, for dynamic regions, we employ time-dependent RBFs to effectively capture temporal variations and handle abrupt scene changes, while for static regions, we reduce redundancy by sharing temporally invariant parameters. Additionally, we introduce a two-stage training strategy tailored for explicit models to enhance temporal coherence at static-dynamic boundaries.

Drawing inspiration from the developmental trajectory of human vision, we propose a progressive blurring curriculum to improve the generalization and robustness of CNNs. Human infants are born with poor visual acuity, gradually refining their ability to perceive fine details. Mimicking this process, we begin training CNNs on highly blurred images during the initial epochs and progressively reduce the blur as training advances. This approach encourages the network to prioritize global structures over high-frequency artifacts, improving robustness against distribution shifts and noisy inputs. Challenging prior claims that blurring in the initial training epochs imposes a stimulus deficit and irreversibly harms model performance, we reveal that early-stage blurring enhances generalization with minimal impact on in-domain accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed curriculum reduces mean corruption error (mCE) by up to 8.30% on CIFAR-10-C and 4.43% on ImageNet-100-C datasets, compared to standard training without blurring. Unlike static blur-based augmentation, which applies blurred images randomly throughout training, our method follows a structured progression, yielding consistent gains across various datasets. Furthermore, our approach complements other augmentation techniques, such as CutMix and MixUp, and enhances both natural and adversarial robustness against common attack methods.

Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation.

To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter.

This has directed research efforts towards architectural interventions, such as coordinate embeddings or specialized activation functions, to represent high-frequency signals. In this paper, we challenge the notion that the low-frequency bias of vanilla MLPs is an intrinsic, architectural limitation to learn high-frequency content, but instead a symptom of stable rank degradation during training. We empirically demonstrate that regulating the network's rank during training substantially improves the fidelity of the learned signal, rendering even simple MLP architectures expressive. Extensive experiments show that using optimizers like Muon, with high-rank, near-orthogonal updates, consistently enhances INR architectures even beyond simple ReLU MLPs. These substantial improvements hold across a diverse range of domains, including natural and medical images, and novel view synthesis, with up to 9 dB PSNR improvements over the previous state-of-the-art.

Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$\u0394$ are provided.

Extended version with full proofs, parameter sweeps, and appendices", "summary": "Contemporary reservoir computing relies heavily on smooth, globally Lipschitz continuous activation functions, limiting applications in defense, disaster response, and pharmaceutical modeling where robust operation under extreme conditions is critical. We systematically investigate non-smooth activation functions, including chaotic, stochastic, and fractal variants, in echo state networks. Through comprehensive parameter sweeps across 36,610 reservoir configurations, we demonstrate that several non-smooth functions not only maintain the Echo State Property (ESP) but outperform traditional smooth activations in convergence speed and spectral radius tolerance. Notably, the Cantor function (continuous everywhere and flat almost everywhere) maintains ESP-consistent behavior up to spectral radii of rho ~ 10, an order of magnitude beyond typical bounds for smooth functions, while achieving 2.6x faster convergence than tanh and ReLU. We introduce a theoretical framework for quantized activation functions, defining a Degenerate Echo State Property (d-ESP) that captures stability for discrete-output functions and proving that d-ESP implies traditional ESP. We identify a critical crowding ratio Q=N/k (reservoir size / quantization levels) that predicts failure thresholds for discrete activations. Our analysis reveals that preprocessing topology, rather than continuity per se, determines stability: monotone, compressive preprocessing maintains ESP across scales, while dispersive or discontinuous preprocessing triggers sharp failures. While our findings challenge assumptions about activation function design in reservoir computing, the mechanism underlying the exceptional performance of certain fractal functions remains unexplained, suggesting fundamental gaps in our understanding of how geometric properties of activation functions influence reservoir dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u67d0\u4e9b\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u51fd\u6570\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u6301\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9891\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6ed1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u50a8\u5c42\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f9d\u8d56\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u9700\u8981\u9c81\u68d2\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u56fd\u9632\u3001\u707e\u5bb3\u54cd\u5e94\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc736,610\u4e2a\u50a8\u5c42\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6df7\u6c8c\u3001\u968f\u673a\u548c\u5206\u5f62\u7b49\u975e\u5149\u6ed1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u5149\u6ed1\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "Cantor\u51fd\u6570\u5c06ESP\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u9891\u8c31\u534a\u5f84\u03c1~10\uff0c\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u51fd\u6570\u9ad8\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4tanh\u548cReLU\u5feb2.6\u500d\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u9000\u5316\u56de\u58f0\u72b6\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9884\u5904\u7406\u62d3\u6251\u800c\u975e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u672c\u8eab\u51b3\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5355\u8c03\u538b\u7f29\u9884\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301ESP\uff0c\u800c\u5206\u6563\u6216\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u5904\u7406\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7a81\u7136\u5931\u6548\u3002\u5206\u5f62\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Early identification of patients at risk for deterioration is essential not only for patient care quality monitoring but also for physician care management. However, translating varied data streams into accurate and interpretable risk assessments poses significant challenges due to inconsistent data formats. We develop a multimodal machine learning framework, the Early Warning Index (EWI), to predict the aggregate risk of ICU admission, emergency response team dispatch, and mortality. Key to EWI's design is a human-in-the-loop process: clinicians help determine alert thresholds and interpret model outputs, which are enhanced by explainable outputs using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to highlight clinical and operational factors (e.g., scheduled surgeries, ward census) driving each patient's risk. We deploy EWI in a hospital dashboard that stratifies patients into three risk tiers. Using a dataset of 18,633 unique patients at a large U.S. hospital, our approach automatically extracts features from both structured and unstructured electronic health record (EHR) data and achieves C-statistics of 0.796. It is currently used as a triage tool for proactively managing at-risk patients. The proposed approach saves physicians valuable time by automatically sorting patients of varying risk levels, allowing them to concentrate on patient care rather than sifting through complex EHR data. By further pinpointing specific risk drivers, the proposed model provides data-informed adjustments to caregiver scheduling and allocation of critical resources. As a result, clinicians and administrators can avert downstream complications, including costly procedures or high readmission rates and improve overall patient flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6EWI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u60a3\u8005\u6076\u5316\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u65b9\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\u8b66\u62a5\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u533b\u9662\u4eea\u8868\u677f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e09\u5c42\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\uff0cC\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u8fbe\u52300.796", "motivation": "\u533b\u9662\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u6765\u5229\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u4e34\u5e8a\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6570\u636e\u6709\u6548\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e9\u671f\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u60a3\u8005\u5bf9\u533b\u7597\u8d28\u91cf\u76d1\u63a7\u548c\u533b\u751f\u7ba1\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1EWI\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff08\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5e2e\u52a9\u786e\u5b9a\u8b66\u62a5\u9608\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u7a81\u51fa\u98ce\u9669\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u4ece\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316EHR\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81", "result": "\u572818,633\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0C\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf0.796\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u4e3a\u5206\u8bca\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u7b49\u7ea7\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u533b\u751f\u8282\u7701\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u8bc6\u522b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u9884\u9632\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4e3a\u62a4\u7406\u4eba\u5458\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u5173\u952e\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u636e\u652f\u6301"}}

The core idea behind DISCODE lies in its test-time adaptive evaluation approach, which introduces the Adaptive Test-Time (ATT) loss, leveraging a Gaussian prior distribution to improve robustness in evaluation score estimation. This loss is efficiently minimized at test time using an analytical solution that we derive. Furthermore, we introduce the Multi-domain Caption Evaluation (MCEval) benchmark, a new image captioning evaluation benchmark covering six distinct domains, designed to assess the robustness of evaluation metrics.

Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $\u03b1$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $\u03b1\\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $\u03b1$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $\u03b1\\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $\u03b1\\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\u03b1\u2208(0,2]\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u03b1\u2208(1,2]\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5373\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u5747\u503c\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u800c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u5728\u03b1\u63a5\u8fd11\u65f6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u65e0\u7a77\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u03b1\u2208(0,2]\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u566a\u58f0\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u5747\u503c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5c3e\u90e8\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u88c1\u526a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u566a\u58f0\u5c3e\u90e8\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u53d7\u63a7\u65f6\uff0c\u88c1\u526a\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u5c3e\u6307\u6570\u03b1\u2208(0,2]\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u6790\u7b80\u6d01\u6613\u7528\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u8f7b\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5c3e\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

A central obstacle is the absence of reliable memorization detection mechanisms, limited quantitative evaluation, and poor generalization of existing privacy auditing methods across domains. To address this, we propose to view memorization detection as a unified problem at the intersection of re-identification and copy detection, whose complementary goals cover both identity consistency and augmentation-robust duplication, and introduce Latent Contrastive Memorization Network (LCMem), a cross-domain model evaluated jointly on both tasks. LCMem achieves this through a two-stage training strategy that first learns identity consistency before incorporating augmentation-robust copy detection. Across six benchmark datasets, LCMem achieves improvements of up to 16 percentage points on re-identification and 30 percentage points on copy detection, enabling substantially more reliable memorization detection at scale. Our results show that existing privacy filters provide limited performance and robustness, highlighting the need for stronger protection mechanisms. We show that LCMem sets a new standard for cross-domain privacy auditing, offering reliable and scalable memorization detection.

We identify a key underlying cause: attention collapse in existing attention sharing mechanisms, where either positional embeddings or semantic features dominate visual content retrieval, leading to over-editing or under-editing.To address this issue, we introduce SynPS, a method that Synergistically leverages Positional embeddings and Semantic information for faithful non-rigid image editing. We first propose an editing measurement that quantifies the required editing magnitude at each denoising step. Based on this measurement, we design an attention synergy pipeline that dynamically modulates the influence of positional embeddings, enabling SynPS to balance semantic modifications and fidelity preservation.By adaptively integrating positional and semantic cues, SynPS effectively avoids both over- and under-editing.

However, these denoisers rely largely on generic or hand-crafted priors and often fall short in accurately capturing the complex statistical structure of natural images. As a result, traditional plug-and-play (PnP) methods often lead to suboptimal reconstruction, especially in highly underdetermined regimes. Recently, score-based generative models have emerged as a powerful framework for accurately characterizing sophisticated image distribution. Yet, their direct use for posterior sampling typically incurs prohibitive computational complexity. In this paper, by exploiting the close connection between score-based generative modeling and empirical Bayes denoising, we devise a message-passing framework that integrates a score-based minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) denoiser for compressive image recovery. The resulting algorithm, named score-based turbo message passing (STMP), combines the fast convergence of message passing with the expressive power of score-based generative priors. For practical systems with quantized measurements, we further propose quantized STMP (Q-STMP), which augments STMP with a component-wise MMSE dequantization module. We demonstrate that the asymptotic performance of STMP and Q-STMP can be accurately predicted by a set of state-evolution (SE) equations. Experiments on the FFHQ dataset demonstrate that STMP strikes a significantly better performance-complexity tradeoff compared with competing baselines, and that Q-STMP remains robust even under 1-bit quantization. Remarkably, both STMP and Q-STMP typically converge within 10 iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684Turbo\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08STMP\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684PnP\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u901a\u7528\u6216\u624b\u5de5\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u6349\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6b20\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u5f81\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fc7\u9ad8\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u53bb\u566a\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684MMSE\u53bb\u566a\u5668\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51faQ-STMP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5206\u91cf\u7ea7MMSE\u53bb\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "STMP\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0cQ-STMP\u57281\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u572810\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u5185\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u65b9\u7a0b\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "STMP\u548cQ-STMP\u7b97\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6d88\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, video synthesis by artificially shifting and scaling image instance masks fails to accurately model realistic motion in videos, such as perspective changes, movement by parts of one or multiple instances, or camera motion. To tackle this issue, we propose an unsupervised video instance segmentation model trained exclusively on real video data. We start from unsupervised instance segmentation masks on individual video frames. However, these single-frame segmentations exhibit temporal noise and their quality varies through the video. Therefore, we establish temporal coherence by identifying high-quality keymasks in the video by leveraging deep motion priors. The sparse keymask pseudo-annotations are then used to train a segmentation model for implicit mask propagation, for which we propose a Sparse-To-Dense Distillation approach aided by a Temporal DropLoss.

Regular inspections are required to ensure their safety, yet traditional manual procedures are time-consuming, subjective, and costly. Recent advances in mobile mapping systems and Deep Learning (DL) enable automated visual inspections. However, their effectiveness is limited by the scarcity of tunnel datasets. This paper introduces a new publicly available dataset containing annotated images of three different tunnel linings, capturing typical defects: cracks, leaching, and water infiltration.

Code: https://github.com/hustvl/SuperCLIP", "summary": "Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes.

Here, we show that these barriers can be overcome by building clinical native intelligence directly from real-world medical practice. Our key insight is that large-scale telemedicine programs, where expert centers provide remote consultations across distributed facilities, represent a natural reservoir for learning clinical image interpretation. We present ReVision, a retinal foundation model that learns from the natural alignment between 485,980 color fundus photographs and their corresponding diagnostic reports, accumulated through a decade-long telemedicine program spanning 162 medical institutions across China. Through extensive evaluation across 27 ophthalmic benchmarks, we demonstrate that ReVison enables deployment efficiency with minimal local resources. Without any task-specific training, ReVision achieves zero-shot disease detection with an average AUROC of 0.946 across 12 public benchmarks and 0.952 on 3 independent clinical cohorts. When minimal adaptation is feasible, ReVision matches extensively fine-tuned alternatives while requiring orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and labeled examples. The learned representations also transfer effectively to new clinical sites, imaging domains, imaging modalities, and systemic health prediction tasks. In a prospective reader study with 33 ophthalmologists, ReVision's zero-shot assistance improved diagnostic accuracy by 14.8% across all experience levels.

Specifically, DASP consists of an adversarial branch for extracting spatiotemporal priors and a self-supervised branch for learning. In the adversarial branch, we first design an adversarial network where the discriminator is composed of four devised spatiotemporal priors learning blocks (SPLB) to exploit the daytime priors. In particular, the SPLB contains a spatial-based temporal learning module (STLM) that uses orthogonal differencing to extract motion-related variations along the time axis and an axial spatial learning module (ASLM) that adopts local asymmetric convolutions with global axial attention to capture the multiscale structural information. By combining STLM and ASLM, our model can acquire sufficient spatiotemporal features to restore textureless areas and estimate the blurry regions caused by dynamic objects. In the self-supervised branch, we propose a 3D consistency projection loss to bilaterally project the target frame and source frame into a shared 3D space, and calculate the 3D discrepancy between the two projected frames as a loss to optimize the 3D structural consistency and daytime priors. Extensive experiments on the Oxford RobotCar and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for nighttime depth estimation. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDASP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u65f6\u7a7a\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u591c\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u6297\u5206\u652f\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u767d\u5929\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u7531\u4e8e\u4f4e\u53ef\u89c1\u5ea6\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u5149\u7167\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u7eb9\u7406\u7f3a\u5931\u533a\u57df\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6a21\u7cca\u533a\u57df\u95ee\u9898", "method": "DASP\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u5bf9\u6297\u5206\u652f\uff08\u4f7f\u75284\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7a\u5148\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u5757SPLB\u63d0\u53d6\u767d\u5929\u5148\u9a8c\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u652f\uff08\u4f7f\u75283D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u635f\u5931\u4f18\u53163D\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u3002SPLB\u5305\u542b\u65f6\u7a7a\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757STLM\u548c\u8f74\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757ASLM", "result": "\u5728Oxford RobotCar\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "DASP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u7a7a\u5148\u9a8c\u548c3D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591c\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6709\u6548\u6027"}}

In this paper, we introduce a novel setting for MIL methods, inspired by proceedings in Neural Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Solvers. Instead of relying on complex attention-based aggregation, we propose an efficient, aggregator-agnostic framework that removes the complexity of correlation learning from the MIL aggregator. CAPRMIL produces rich context-aware patch embeddings that promote effective correlation learning on downstream tasks. By projecting patch features -- extracted using a frozen patch encoder -- into a small set of global context/morphology-aware tokens and utilizing multi-head self-attention, CAPRMIL injects global context with linear computational complexity with respect to the bag size. Paired with a simple Mean MIL aggregator, CAPRMIL matches state-of-the-art slide-level performance across multiple public pathology benchmarks, while reducing the total number of trainable parameters by 48%-92.8% versus SOTA MILs, lowering FLOPs during inference by 52%-99%, and ranking among the best models on GPU memory efficiency and training time. Our results indicate that learning rich, context-aware instance representations before aggregation is an effective and scalable alternative to complex pooling for whole-slide analysis.

As a step forward, we explore a few possible candidates, including random lattices, generalized Fibonacci lattices, and densest sphere packing lattices. Among all, we find the Leech lattice-based quantization method, which is dubbed as Spherical Leech Quantization ($\u039b_{24}$-SQ), leads to both a simplified training recipe and an improved reconstruction-compression tradeoff thanks to its high symmetry and even distribution on the hypersphere. In image tokenization and compression tasks, this quantization approach achieves better reconstruction quality across all metrics than BSQ, the best prior art, while consuming slightly fewer bits.

However, when using multiple reference images from the same ID, existing methods typically produce lower-fidelity portraits and struggle to customize face attributes precisely. To address these issues, this paper presents HiFi-Portrait, a high-fidelity method for zero-shot portrait generation. Specifically, we first introduce the face refiner and landmark generator to obtain fine-grained multi-face features and 3D-aware face landmarks. The landmarks include the reference ID and the target attributes. Then, we design HiFi-Net to fuse multi-face features and align them with landmarks, which improves ID fidelity and face control.

Recent advancements in MedIR have focused on All-in-One models capable of simultaneously addressing multiple different MedIR tasks. However, due to significant differences in both modality and degradation types, using a shared model for these diverse tasks requires careful consideration of two critical inter-task relationships: task interference, which occurs when conflicting gradient update directions arise across tasks on the same parameter, and task imbalance, which refers to uneven optimization caused by varying learning difficulties inherent to each task. To address these challenges, we propose a task-adaptive Transformer (TAT), a novel framework that dynamically adapts to different tasks through two key innovations. First, a task-adaptive weight generation strategy is introduced to mitigate task interference by generating task-specific weight parameters for each task, thereby eliminating potential gradient conflicts on shared weight parameters. Second, a task-adaptive loss balancing strategy is introduced to dynamically adjust loss weights based on task-specific learning difficulties, preventing task domination or undertraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed TAT achieves state-of-the-art performance in three MedIR tasks--PET synthesis, CT denoising, and MRI super-resolution--both in task-specific and All-in-One settings.

In this work, we propose a novel correspondence-aware feature refinement framework, termed CLNet, that explicitly bridges the semantic and geometric gaps between different views. CLNet decomposes the view alignment process into three learnable and complementary modules: a Neural Correspondence Map (NCM) that spatially aligns cross-view features via latent correspondence fields; a Nonlinear Embedding Converter (NEC) that remaps features across perspectives using an MLP-based transformation; and a Global Feature Recalibration (GFR) module that reweights informative feature channels guided by learned spatial cues. The proposed CLNet can jointly capture both high-level semantics and fine-grained alignments.

In this work, we present FoodLogAthl-218, a food image dataset constructed from real-world meal records collected through the dietary management application FoodLog Athl. The dataset contains 6,925 images across 218 food categories, with a total of 14,349 bounding boxes. Rich metadata, including meal date and time, anonymized user IDs, and meal-level context, accompany each image. Unlike conventional datasets-where a predefined class set guides web-based image collection-our data begins with user-submitted photos, and labels are applied afterward. This yields greater intra-class diversity, a natural frequency distribution of meal types, and casual, unfiltered images intended for personal use rather than public sharing. In addition to (1) a standard classification benchmark, we introduce two FoodLog-specific tasks: (2) an incremental fine-tuning protocol that follows the temporal stream of users' logs, and (3) a context-aware classification task where each image contains multiple dishes, and the model must classify each dish by leveraging the overall meal context.

Moreover, using a simple survival follow-up label is insufficient to supervise such a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose KEMM, an LLM-driven Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Model for cancer survival prediction, which integrates expert reports and prognostic background knowledge. 1) Expert reports, provided by pathologists on a case-by-case basis and refined by large language model (LLM), offer succinct and clinically focused diagnostic statements. This information may typically suggest different survival outcomes. 2) Prognostic background knowledge (PBK), generated concisely by LLM, provides valuable prognostic background knowledge on different cancer types, which also enhances survival prediction. To leverage these knowledge, we introduce the knowledge-enhanced cross-modal (KECM) attention module. KECM can effectively guide the network to focus on discriminative and survival-relevant features from highly redundant modalities.

Existing detection methods typically rely on manipulation-specific cues, performing well on known forgery types but exhibiting severe limitations against emerging manipulation techniques. This poor generalization stems from their inability to adapt effectively to unseen forgery patterns. To overcome this, we leverage large-scale pretrained models (e.g. CLIP) to proactively probe the feature space, explicitly highlighting distributional gaps between real videos, known forgeries, and unseen manipulations. Specifically, FakeRadar introduces Forgery Outlier Probing, which employs dynamic subcluster modeling and cluster-conditional outlier generation to synthesize outlier samples near boundaries of estimated subclusters, simulating novel forgery artifacts beyond known manipulation types. Additionally, we design Outlier-Guided Tri-Training, which optimizes the detector to distinguish real, fake, and outlier samples using proposed outlier-driven contrastive learning and outlier-conditioned cross-entropy losses.

WorldPlay draws power from three key innovations. 1) We use a Dual Action Representation to enable robust action control in response to the user's keyboard and mouse inputs. 2) To enforce long-term consistency, our Reconstituted Context Memory dynamically rebuilds context from past frames and uses temporal reframing to keep geometrically important but long-past frames accessible, effectively alleviating memory attenuation. 3) We also propose Context Forcing, a novel distillation method designed for memory-aware model.

While this approach has shown promising results for image data, extending dataset distillation methods to video data has proven challenging and often leads to suboptimal performance. In this work, we first identify the core challenge in video set distillation as the substantial increase in learnable parameters introduced by the temporal dimension of video, which complicates optimization and hinders convergence. To address this issue, we observe that a single frame is often sufficient to capture the discriminative semantics of a video. Leveraging this insight, we propose Single-Frame Video set Distillation (SFVD), a framework that distills videos into highly informative frames for each class. Using differentiable interpolation, these frames are transformed into video sequences and matched with the original dataset, while updates are restricted to the frames themselves for improved optimization efficiency. To further incorporate temporal information, the distilled frames are combined with sampled real videos from real videos during the matching process through a channel reshaping layer. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SFVD substantially outperforms prior methods, achieving improvements of up to 5.3% on MiniUCF, thereby offering a more effective solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5355\u5e27\u89c6\u9891\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\uff08SFVD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u5355\u5e27\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u63d2\u503c\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u662f\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be\u548c\u6536\u655b\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u5e27\u901a\u5e38\u8db3\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5224\u522b\u6027\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSFVD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u6bcf\u7c7b\u7684\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5e27\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u63d2\u503c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u5e8f\u5217\u5e76\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ed3\u5408\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSFVD\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728MiniUCF\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe5.3%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SFVD\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5e27\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To effectively monitor glacier conditions, it is crucial to consistently estimate positional shifts of glacier calving fronts. AMD-HookNet firstly introduces a pure two-branch convolutional neural network (CNN) for glacier segmentation. Yet, the local nature and translational invariance of convolution operations, while beneficial for capturing low-level details, restricts the model ability to maintain long-range dependencies. In this study, we propose AMD-HookNet++, a novel advanced hybrid CNN-Transformer feature enhancement method for segmenting glaciers and delineating calving fronts in synthetic aperture radar images. Our hybrid structure consists of two branches: a Transformer-based context branch to capture long-range dependencies, which provides global contextual information in a larger view, and a CNN-based target branch to preserve local details. To strengthen the representation of the connected hybrid features, we devise an enhanced spatial-channel attention module to foster interactions between the hybrid CNN-Transformer branches through dynamically adjusting the token relationships from both spatial and channel perspectives. Additionally, we develop a pixel-to-pixel contrastive deep supervision to optimize our hybrid model by integrating pixelwise metric learning into glacier segmentation. Through extensive experiments and comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses on the challenging glacier segmentation benchmark dataset CaFFe, we show that AMD-HookNet++ sets a new state of the art with an IoU of 78.2 and a HD95 of 1,318 m, while maintaining a competitive MDE of 367 m.

Standard diagnostic practice combines hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained whole slide images with immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, and molecular genetic tests to determine lymphoma subtypes, a process requiring costly equipment, skilled personnel, and causing treatment delays. Deep learning methods could assist pathologists by extracting diagnostic information from routinely available HE-stained slides, yet comprehensive benchmarks for lymphoma subtyping on multicenter data are lacking. In this work, we present the first multicenter lymphoma benchmarking dataset covering four common lymphoma subtypes and healthy control tissue. We systematically evaluate five publicly available pathology foundation models (H-optimus-1, H0-mini, Virchow2, UNI2, Titan) combined with attention-based (AB-MIL) and transformer-based (TransMIL) multiple instance learning aggregators across three magnifications (10x, 20x, 40x). On in-distribution test sets, models achieve multiclass balanced accuracies exceeding 80% across all magnifications, with all foundation models performing similarly and both aggregation methods showing comparable results. The magnification study reveals that 40x resolution is sufficient, with no performance gains from higher resolutions or cross-magnification aggregation.

We present a flexible, modular, and adaptable pipeline that improves segmentation performance by selecting and combining state-of-the-art models and applying tumor- and lesion-specific processing before and after training. Radiomic features extracted from MRI help detect tumor subtype, ensuring a more balanced training. Custom lesion-level performance metrics determine the influence of each model in the ensemble and optimize post-processing that further refines the predictions, enabling the workflow to tailor every step to each case. On the BraTS testing sets, our pipeline achieved performance comparable to top-ranked algorithms across multiple challenges.

Existing MLLMs typically perform textual reasoning solely from a single static mathematical image, overlooking dynamic visual acquisition during reasoning. In contrast, humans repeatedly examine visual image and employ step-by-step reasoning to prove intermediate propositions. This strategy of decomposing the problem-solving process into key logical nodes adheres to Miller's Law in cognitive science. Inspired by this insight, we propose a ViRC framework for multimodal mathematical tasks, introducing a Reason Chunking mechanism that structures multimodal mathematical CoT into consecutive Critical Reasoning Units (CRUs) to simulate human expert problem-solving patterns. CRUs ensure intra-unit textual coherence for intermediate proposition verification while integrating visual information across units to generate subsequent propositions and support structured reasoning. To this end, we present CRUX dataset by using three visual tools and four reasoning patterns to provide explicitly annotated CRUs across multiple reasoning paths for each mathematical problem. Leveraging the CRUX dataset, we propose a progressive training strategy inspired by human cognitive learning, which includes Instructional SFT, Practice SFT, and Strategic RL, aimed at further strengthening the Reason Chunking ability of the model.The resulting ViRC-7B model achieves a 18.8\\% average improvement over baselines across multiple mathematical benchmarks.

Key obstacles include building large-scale VSA datasets and developing effective methodologies that enable algorithms to identify emotionally significant elements within an image. These challenges are reflected in the limited generalization performance of VSA algorithms and models when trained and tested across different datasets. Starting from a pool of existing data collections, our approach enables the creation of a new larger dataset that not only contains a wider variety of images than the original ones, but also permits training new models with improved capability to focus on emotionally relevant combinations of image elements.

Previous methods for articulated object reconstruction either rely on slow optimization with fragile cross-state correspondences or use feed-forward models limited to specific object categories. In contrast, ART treats articulated objects as assemblies of rigid parts, formulating reconstruction as part-based prediction. Our newly designed transformer architecture maps sparse image inputs to a set of learnable part slots, from which ART jointly decodes unified representations for individual parts, including their 3D geometry, texture, and explicit articulation parameters. The resulting reconstructions are physically interpretable and readily exportable for simulation. Trained on a large-scale, diverse dataset with per-part supervision, and evaluated across diverse benchmarks, ART achieves significant improvements over existing baselines and establishes a new state of the art for articulated object reconstruction from image inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ART\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7c7b\u522b\u3001\u524d\u9988\u76843D\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u72b6\u6001RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6216\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\uff0cART\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u89c6\u4e3a\u521a\u6027\u90e8\u4ef6\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u90e8\u4ef6\u69fd\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u89e3\u7801\u90e8\u4ef6\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u94f0\u63a5\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684state-of-the-art\u3002", "conclusion": "ART\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\uff0c\u4e3a\u94f0\u63a5\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This research tackles two major challenges: capturing the subtle expression details present in real human faces, and reconstructing an intricate 3D head avatar from a single portrait image. To accurately model expression details, VASA-3D leverages the motion latent of VASA-1, a method that yields exceptional realism and vividness in 2D talking heads. A critical element of our work is translating this motion latent to 3D, which is accomplished by devising a 3D head model that is conditioned on the motion latent. Customization of this model to a single image is achieved through an optimization framework that employs numerous video frames of the reference head synthesized from the input image. The optimization takes various training losses robust to artifacts and limited pose coverage in the generated training data. Our experiment shows that VASA-3D produces realistic 3D talking heads that cannot be achieved by prior art, and it supports the online generation of 512x512 free-viewpoint videos at up to 75 FPS, facilitating more immersive engagements with lifelike 3D avatars.", "AI": {"tldr": "VASA-3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf3D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eceVASA-1\u63d0\u53d6\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u52303D\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u8096\u50cf\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8868\u60c5\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u903c\u771f3D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u8096\u50cf\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u590d\u67423D\u5934\u90e8\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u8138\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u5999\u8868\u60c5\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528VASA-1\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u52a8\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u76843D\u5934\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u5934\u90e8\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u6709\u9650\u59ff\u6001\u8986\u76d6\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "VASA-3D\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u66f4\u903c\u771f\u76843D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u751f\u6210512x512\u81ea\u7531\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u53ef\u8fbe75 FPS\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6c89\u6d78\u5f0f\u7684\u903c\u771f3D\u5934\u50cf\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u57283D\u5934\u90e8\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u7ec6\u8282\u6355\u6349\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

Based on O-Voxel, we design a Sparse Compression VAE which provides a high spatial compression rate and a compact latent space. We train large-scale flow-matching models comprising 4B parameters for 3D generation using diverse public 3D asset datasets. Despite their scale, inference remains highly efficient.

While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at various video understanding tasks, the recipes for optimizing them for VTG remain under-explored. In this paper, we present TimeLens, a systematic investigation into building MLLMs with strong VTG ability, along two primary dimensions: data quality and algorithmic design. We first expose critical quality issues in existing VTG benchmarks and introduce TimeLens-Bench, comprising meticulously re-annotated versions of three popular benchmarks with strict quality criteria. Our analysis reveals dramatic model re-rankings compared to legacy benchmarks, confirming the unreliability of prior evaluation standards. We also address noisy training data through an automated re-annotation pipeline, yielding TimeLens-100K, a large-scale, high-quality training dataset. Building on our data foundation, we conduct in-depth explorations of algorithmic design principles, yielding a series of meaningful insights and effective yet efficient practices.

Most existing solutions maintain the memory by compressing historical frames with predefined strategies. However, different to-generate video chunks should refer to different historical cues, which is hard to satisfy with fixed strategies. In this work, we propose MemFlow to address this problem. Specifically, before generating the coming chunk, we dynamically update the memory bank by retrieving the most relevant historical frames with the text prompt of this chunk. This design enables narrative coherence even if new event happens or scenario switches in future frames. In addition, during generation, we only activate the most relevant tokens in the memory bank for each query in the attention layers, which effectively guarantees the generation efficiency. In this way, MemFlow achieves outstanding long-context consistency with negligible computation burden (7.9% speed reduction compared with the memory-free baseline) and keeps the compatibility with any streaming video generation model with KV cache.", "AI": {"tldr": "MemFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u5386\u53f2\u5e27\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b56\u7565\u538b\u7f29\u5386\u53f2\u5e27\u6765\u7ef4\u62a4\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u89c6\u9891\u5757\u9700\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u8fd9\u4e00\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u89c6\u9891\u5757\u524d\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u68c0\u7d22\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u5e27\u66f4\u65b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u4ec5\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee4\u724c\u3002", "result": "MemFlow\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u57fa\u7ebf\u4ec5\u964d\u4f4e7.9%\u901f\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u4efb\u4f55\u5e26KV\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "MemFlow\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7ba1\u7406\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53d9\u4e8b\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Code & Model: https://github.com/fudan-generative-vision/WAM-Flow", "summary": "We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving.
