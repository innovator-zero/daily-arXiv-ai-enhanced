However, most existing DEA-powered soft robots require high voltages and wired power connections, limiting their ability to operate in confined environments. This study presents an untethered thin soft robot (UTS-Robot) powered by thin dielectric elastomer actuators (TS-DEA). The robot measures 38 mm in length, 6 mm in height, and weighs just 2.34 grams, integrating flexible onboard electronics to achieve fully untethered actuation. The TS-DEA, operating at resonant frequencies of 86 Hz under a low driving voltage of 220 V, adopts a dual-actuation sandwiched structure, comprising four dielectric elastomer layers bonded to a compressible tensioning mechanism at its core. This design enables high power density actuation and locomotion via three directional friction pads. The low-voltage actuation is achieved by fabricating each elastomer layer via spin coating to an initial thickness of 50 um, followed by biaxial stretching to 8 um. A comprehensive design and modelling framework has been developed to optimise TS-DEA performance. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the bare TS-DEA achieves a locomotion speed of 12.36 mm/s at resonance, the untethered configuration achieves a locomotion speed of 0.5 mm/s, making it highly suitable for navigating confined and complex environments."}

We present a practical multimodal framework for frame-accurate human-robot interaction intent detection that fuses camera-invariant 2D skeletal pose and facial emotion features extracted from monocular RGB video. Unlike prior methods requiring RGB-D sensors or GPU acceleration, our approach resource-constrained embedded hardware (Raspberry Pi 5, CPU-only). To address the severe class imbalance in natural human-robot interaction datasets, we introduce a novel approach to synthesize temporally coherent pose-emotion-label sequences for data re-balancing called MINT-RVAE (Multimodal Recurrent Variational Autoencoder for Intent Sequence Generation). Comprehensive offline evaluations under cross-subject and cross-scene protocols demonstrate strong generalization performance, achieving frame- and sequence-level AUROC of 0.95. Crucially, we validate real-world generalization through cross-camera evaluation on the MIRA robot head, which employs a different onboard RGB sensor and operates in uncontrolled environments not represented in the training data. Despite this domain shift, the deployed system achieves 91% accuracy and 100% recall across 32 live interaction trials. The close correspondence between offline and deployed performance confirms the cross-sensor and cross-environment robustness of the proposed multimodal approach, highlighting its suitability for ubiquitous multimedia-enabled social robots."}

We introduce UniPred, a bilevel learning framework that unifies both. UniPred uses large language models (LLMs) to propose predicate effect distributions that supervise neural predicate learning from low-level data, while learned feedback iteratively refines the LLM hypotheses. Leveraging strong visual foundation model features, UniPred learns robust predicate classifiers in cluttered scenes. We further propose a predicate evaluation method that supports symbolic models beyond STRIPS assumptions. Across five simulated and one real-robot domains, UniPred achieves 2-4 times higher success rates than top-down methods and 3-4 times faster learning than bottom-up approaches, advancing scalable and flexible symbolic world modeling for robotics."}

However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs."}

While vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong generalization, current benchmarks provide limited understanding of how embodiment -- i.e., the choice of physical platform, sensor configuration, and modality alignment -- influences perception, reasoning, and control. We introduce Embodied4C, a closed-loop benchmark designed as a Turing test for embodied reasoning. The benchmark evaluates the core embodied capabilities of VLMs across three heterogeneous embodiments -- autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, and robotic manipulators -- through approximately 1.1K one-shot reasoning questions and 58 goal-directed navigation tasks. These tasks jointly assess four foundational dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical reasoning. Each embodiment presents dynamic sensor configurations and environment variations to probe generalization beyond platform-specific adaptation. To prevent embodiment overfitting, Embodied4C integrates domain-far queries targeting abstract and cross-context reasoning. Comprehensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art VLMs and four embodied control baselines shows that cross-modal alignment and instruction tuning matter more than scale, while spatial and temporal reasoning remains the primary bottleneck for reliable embodied competence."}

Many existing robotic neurosurgical tools are designed using stainless steel or nitinol materials. Using polymer-based materials instead can offer advantages such as reduced interference in magnetic resonance imaging, enhanced safety for guiding electrically powered instruments, and reduced tissue damage due to inherent compliance. Several polymer materials have been used in robotic surgical applications, such as polyimide, polycarbonate, and elastic resin. Various fabrication strategies have also been proposed, including standard microfabrication techniques, thermal drawing, and 3-D printing. In our previous work, a tendon-driven, notched-tube was designed for several neurosurgical robotic tools, utilizing laser micromachining to reduce the stiffness of the tube in certain directions. This fabrication method is desirable because it has a single-step process, has high precision, and does not require a cleanroom or harsh chemicals. Past studies have explored laser-micromachining of polymer material for surgical applications such as stent fabrication. In this work, we explore extending the use of the laser micromachining approach to the fabrication of polyimide (PI) robotically steerable cannulas for neurosurgical applications. Utilizing the method presented in this work, we fabricated joints as small as 1.5 mm outer diameter (OD). Multiple joints were fabricated using PI tubes of different ODs, and the loading behavior of the fabricated joints was experimentally characterized."}

To fully unlock the potential of IL for surgery, access to clinical datasets is needed, which unfortunately lack the kinematic data required for current IL approaches. A promising source of large-scale surgical demonstrations is monocular surgical videos available online, making monocular pose estimation a crucial step toward enabling large-scale robot learning. Toward this end, we propose SurgiPose, a differentiable rendering based approach to estimate kinematic information from monocular surgical videos, eliminating the need for direct access to ground truth kinematics. Our method infers tool trajectories and joint angles by optimizing tool pose parameters to minimize the discrepancy between rendered and real images. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on two robotic surgical tasks: tissue lifting and needle pickup, using the da Vinci Research Kit Si (dVRK Si). We train imitation learning policies with both ground truth measured kinematics and estimated kinematics from video and compare their performance. Our results show that policies trained on estimated kinematics achieve comparable success rates to those trained on ground truth data, demonstrating the feasibility of using monocular video based kinematic estimation for surgical robot learning. By enabling kinematic estimation from monocular surgical videos, our work lays the foundation for large scale learning of autonomous surgical policies from online surgical data."}

Supervised contrastive approaches based on the InfoNCE loss suffer from negative-sample dilution and lack adaptive decision boundaries, thereby reducing discriminative power in fine-grained recognition tasks. To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision. In addition, an explicit style-distance constraint further disentangles style and content representations, leading to more robust feature learning. Comprehensive experiments on six benchmark datasets, including CUB200-2011 and Stanford Dogs, demonstrate that SCS-SupCon achieves state-of-the-art performance across both CNN and Transformer backbones. On CIFAR-100 with ResNet-50, SCS-SupCon improves top-1 accuracy over SupCon by approximately 3.9 percentage points and over CS-SupCon by approximately 1.7 points under five-fold cross-validation. On fine-grained datasets, it outperforms CS-SupCon by 0.4--3.0 points. Extensive ablation studies and statistical analyses further confirm the robustness and generalization of the proposed framework, with Friedman tests and Nemenyi post-hoc evaluations validating the stability of the observed improvements."}

Traditional approaches for this task often struggle with the complex instance shapes and occlusions inherent in indoor environments. They frequently overshoot by attempting to predict 3D shapes directly from incomplete 2D images, which results in limited reconstruction quality. We aim to overcome this limitation by splitting the process into two steps: first, we employ diffusion-based techniques to predict the complete views of the room background and occluded indoor instances, then transform them into 3D. Our modular framework makes contributions to this field through the following components: an amodal completion module for restoring the full view of occluded instances, an inpainting model specifically trained to predict room layouts, a hybrid depth estimation technique that balances overall geometric accuracy with fine detail expressiveness, and a view-space alignment method that exploits both 2D and 3D cues to ensure precise placement of instances within the scene. This approach effectively reconstructs both foreground instances and the room background from a single image. Extensive experiments on the 3D-Front dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in terms of both visual quality and reconstruction accuracy. The framework holds promising potential for applications in interior design, real estate, and augmented reality."}

This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections."}

Our method decomposes shapes into partlets - implicit 3D part representations - matched to part descriptions via bipartite assignment.

The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments. Our findings offer actionable insights toward building robust, edge-deployable solutions that enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals alike."}

The proposed approach effectively represents the complex deformation phenomena inherent in soft actuators. Experimental results validate the accuracy and robustness of the developed model, demonstrating improvement in predictive performance compared to conventional modeling techniques. The presented framework provides a data-efficient and database-independent solution for soft actuator modeling, advancing the precision and adaptability of soft robotic system design."}

Methods: We introduce NodMAISI, an anatomically constrained, nodule-oriented CT synthesis and augmentation framework trained on a unified multi-source cohort (7,042 patients, 8,841 CTs, 14,444 nodules). The framework integrates: (i) a standardized curation and annotation pipeline linking each CT with organ masks and nodule-level annotations, (ii) a ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator built on MAISI-v2's foundational blocks to enforce anatomy- and lesion-consistent synthesis, and (iii) lesion-aware augmentation that perturbs nodule masks (controlled shrinkage) while preserving surrounding anatomy to generate paired CT variants. Results: Across six public test datasets, NodMAISI improved distributional fidelity relative to MAISI-v2 (real-to-synthetic FID range 1.18 to 2.99 vs 1.69 to 5.21). In lesion detectability analysis using a MONAI nodule detector, NodMAISI substantially increased average sensitivity and more closely matched clinical scans (IMD-CT: 0.69 vs 0.39; DLCS24: 0.63 vs 0.20), with the largest gains for sub-centimeter nodules where MAISI-v2 frequently failed to reproduce the conditioned lesion. In downstream nodule-level malignancy classification trained on LUNA25 and externally evaluated on LUNA16, LNDbv4, and DLCS24, NodMAISI augmentation improved AUC by 0.07 to 0.11 at <=20% clinical data and by 0.12 to 0.21 at 10%, consistently narrowing the performance gap under data scarcity."}

By abstracting the aerial photography problem into the coverage problems in computational geometry, we demonstrate that most of these problems are in fact computationally intractable, with the implication that traditional algorithms cannot solve them efficiently.

However, detecting drones is challenging because of their small size, rapid movement, and low visual contrast. A modified architecture of YolovN called the YolovN-CBi is proposed that incorporates the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and the Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) to improve sensitivity to small object detections. A curated training dataset consisting of 28K images is created with various flying objects and a local test dataset is collected with 2500 images consisting of very small drone objects. The proposed architecture is evaluated on four benchmark datasets, along with the local test dataset. The baseline Yolov5 and the proposed Yolov5-CBi architecture outperform newer Yolo versions, including Yolov8 and Yolov12, in the speed-accuracy trade-off for small object detection. Four other variants of the proposed CBi architecture are also proposed and evaluated, which vary in the placement and usage of CBAM and BiFPN. These variants are further distilled using knowledge distillation techniques for edge deployment, using a Yolov5m-CBi teacher and a Yolov5n-CBi student. The distilled model achieved a mA@P0.5:0.9 of 0.6573, representing a 6.51% improvement over the teacher's score of 0.6171, highlighting the effectiveness of the distillation process. The distilled model is 82.9% faster than the baseline model, making it more suitable for real-time drone detection. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed CBi architecture, together with the distilled lightweight models in advancing efficient and accurate real-time detection of small UAVs."}

The agent then sends the calculated control signals along with the current quadrotor's Yaw angle ($ψ$) to an attitude PID controller. The PID controller then maps the control signals to motor RPMs. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, a model-free off-policy stochastic RL algorithm, was used to train the RL agents.

We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%.

Existing skill-based methods attempt to address this by decomposing actions into reusable abstractions, but they often rely on fixed-length segmentation or environmental priors that limit semantic consistency and cross-task generalization. In this work, we propose AtomSkill, a novel multi-task imitation learning framework that learns and leverages a structured Atomic Skill Space for composable robot manipulation. Our approach is built on two key technical contributions. First, we construct a Semantically Grounded Atomic Skill Library by partitioning demonstrations into variable-length skills using gripper-state keyframe detection and vision-language model annotation. A contrastive learning objective ensures the resulting skill embeddings are both semantically consistent and temporally coherent. Second, we propose an Action Generation module with Keypose Imagination, which jointly predicts a skill's long-horizon terminal keypose and its immediate action sequence. This enables the policy to reason about overarching motion goals and fine-grained control simultaneously, facilitating robust skill chaining. Extensive experiments in simulated and real-world environments show that AtomSkill consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse manipulation tasks."}

Although recent studies have led to the advent of deep learning methods using satellite imagery to predict height maps, these approaches often face a trade-off between data accessibility and spatial resolution. To overcome these limitations, we present SERA-H, an end-to-end model combining a super-resolution module (EDSR) and temporal attention encoding (UTAE). Trained under the supervision of high-density LiDAR data (ALS), our model generates 2.5 m resolution height maps from freely available Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 (10 m) time series data. Evaluated on an open-source benchmark dataset in France, SERA-H, with a MAE of 2.6 m and a coefficient of determination of 0.82, not only outperforms standard Sentinel-1/2 baselines but also achieves performance comparable to or better than methods relying on commercial very high-resolution imagery (SPOT-6/7, PlanetScope, Maxar). These results demonstrate that combining high-resolution supervision with the spatiotemporal information embedded in time series enables the reconstruction of details beyond the input sensors' native resolution. SERA-H opens the possibility of freely mapping forests with high revisit frequency, achieving accuracy comparable to that of costly commercial imagery.

Agents weigh risk, affect, and trust when choosing to comply, refuse (with or without explanation), clarify, or propose safer alternatives. EED Gym provides different scenarios, multiple persona profiles, and metrics for safety, calibration, and refusals, with trust and blame models grounded in a vignette study. Using EED Gym, we find that action masking eliminates unsafe compliance, while explanatory refusals help sustain trust. Constructive styles are rated most trustworthy, empathic styles -- most empathic, and safe RL methods improve robustness but also make agents more prone to overly cautious behavior. We release code, configurations, and reference policies to enable reproducible evaluation and systematic human-robot interaction research on refusal and trust.

However, for real-world applications such as 3D Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, directly training diffusion models on 3D data presents significant challenges due to the high computational demands of extensive GPU resources and large-scale datasets. Existing works mostly reuse 2D diffusion priors to address 3D inverse problems, but fail to fully realize and leverage the generative capacity of diffusion models for high-dimensional data. In this study, we propose a novel 3D patch-based diffusion model that can learn a fully 3D diffusion prior from limited data, enabling scalable generation of high-resolution 3D images.

Our approach not only enables high-quality 3D generation, but also offers an unprecedentedly efficient and accurate solution to high-resolution 3D inverse problems.

We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions.

The Motion Expert performs music-to-3D motion generation while enforcing kinematic plausibility and artistic expressiveness, whereas the Appearance Expert carries out motion- and reference-conditioned video synthesis, preserving visual identity with spatiotemporal coherence. Specifically, the Motion Expert adopts a diffusion model with a BiMamba-Transformer hybrid architecture and a Guidance-Free Training (GFT) strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 3D dance generation. The Appearance Expert employs a decoupled kinematic-aesthetic fine-tuning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in pose-driven image animation. To better benchmark this task, we curate a large-scale and diverse dataset and design a motion-appearance evaluation protocol. Based on this protocol, MACE-Dance also achieves state-of-the-art performance. Project page: https://macedance.github.io/"}

Most existing studies have not incorporated human drivers' prior knowledge when designing trajectory planning models. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel trajectory planning framework that integrates causal prior knowledge into the control process. Both longitudinal and lateral microscopic behaviors of vehicles are modeled to quantify interaction risk, and a staged causal graph is constructed to capture causal dependencies in lane-changing scenarios. Causal effects between the lane-changing vehicle and surrounding vehicles are then estimated using causal inference, including average causal effects (ATE) and conditional average treatment effects (CATE). These causal priors are embedded into a model predictive control (MPC) framework to enhance trajectory planning. The proposed approach is validated on naturalistic vehicle trajectory datasets. Experimental results show that: (1) causal inference provides interpretable and stable quantification of vehicle interactions; (2) individual causal effects reveal driver heterogeneity; and (3) compared with the baseline MPC, the proposed method achieves a closer alignment with human driving behaviors, reducing maximum trajectory deviation from 1.2 m to 0.2 m, lateral velocity fluctuation by 60%, and yaw angle variability by 50%. These findings provide methodological support for human-like trajectory planning and practical value for improving safety, stability, and realism in autonomous vehicle testing and traffic simulation platforms."}

Exploring Source Distributions for Image Flow Matching", "comment": null, "summary": "Flow matching has emerged as a powerful generative modeling approach with flexible choices of source distribution. While Gaussian distributions are commonly used, the potential for better alternatives in high-dimensional data generation remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel 2D simulation that captures high-dimensional geometric properties in an interpretable 2D setting, enabling us to analyze the learning dynamics of flow matching during training. Based on this analysis, we derive several key insights about flow matching behavior: (1) density approximation can paradoxically degrade performance due to mode discrepancy, (2) directional alignment suffers from path entanglement when overly concentrated, (3) Gaussian's omnidirectional coverage ensures robust learning, and (4) norm misalignment incurs substantial learning costs. Building on these insights, we propose a practical framework that combines norm-aligned training with directionally-pruned sampling. This approach maintains the robust omnidirectional supervision essential for stable flow learning, while eliminating initializations in data-sparse regions during inference. Importantly, our pruning strategy can be applied to any flow matching model trained with a Gaussian source, providing immediate performance gains without the need for retraining. Empirical evaluations demonstrate consistent improvements in both generation quality and sampling efficiency. Our findings provide practical insights and guidelines for source distribution design and introduce a readily applicable technique for improving existing flow matching models.

Accurate prediction of LC mortality rates is crucial for guiding targeted interventions and addressing health disparities. Although traditional regression-based models have been commonly used, explainable machine learning models may offer enhanced predictive accuracy and deeper insights into the factors influencing LC mortality. This study applied three models: random forest (RF), gradient boosting regression (GBR), and linear regression (LR) to predict county-level LC mortality rates across the United States. Model performance was evaluated using R-squared and root mean squared error (RMSE). Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) values were used to determine variable importance and their directional impact. Geographic disparities in LC mortality were analyzed through Getis-Ord (Gi*) hotspot analysis. The RF model outperformed both GBR and LR, achieving an R2 value of 41.9% and an RMSE of 12.8. SHAP analysis identified smoking rate as the most important predictor, followed by median home value and the percentage of the Hispanic ethnic population. Spatial analysis revealed significant clusters of elevated LC mortality in the mid-eastern counties of the United States. The RF model demonstrated superior predictive performance for LC mortality rates, emphasizing the critical roles of smoking prevalence, housing values, and the percentage of Hispanic ethnic population. These findings offer valuable actionable insights for designing targeted interventions, promoting screening, and addressing health disparities in regions most affected by LC in the United States."}

Variable stiffness actuators are well suited for such applications. However, in most existing designs, stiffness is coupled with the deflection angle, complicating both modeling and control. To address this limitation, this paper presents a variable stiffness actuator featuring decoupled stiffness and output behavior for rehabilitation robotics. The system integrates a variable stiffness mechanism that combines a variable-length lever with a hypocycloidal straight-line mechanism to achieve a linear torque-deflection relationship and continuous stiffness modulation from near zero to theoretically infinite. It also incorporates a differential transmission mechanism based on a planetary gear system that enables dual-motor load sharing. A cascade PI controller is further developed on the basis of the differential configuration, in which the position-loop term jointly regulates stiffness and deflection angle, effectively suppressing stiffness fluctuations and output disturbances. The performance of prototype was experimentally validated through stiffness calibration, stiffness regulation, torque control, decoupled characteristics, and dual-motor load sharing, indicating the potential for rehabilitation exoskeletons and other pHRI systems."}

Our model consists of three key components: (i) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE), which integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics to estimate object centers accurately (ii) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS), which generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering and supplements each object by sampling spatially and semantically aligned points around it and (iii) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB), which adaptively balances queries between foreground and background regions. Our extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves performance across multiple state-of-the-art detectors, achieving gains of up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, particularly in challenging scenes with occlusions or dense crowds.

Monotonicity constraints align model behavior with domain knowledge, but their performance cost - the price of monotonicity - is not well quantified. This paper benchmarks monotone-constrained versus unconstrained gradient boosting models for credit probability of default across five public datasets and three libraries. We define the Price of Monotonicity (PoM) as the relative change in standard performance metrics when moving from unconstrained to constrained models, estimated via paired comparisons with bootstrap uncertainty. In our experiments, PoM in AUC ranges from essentially zero to about 2.9 percent: constraints are almost costless on large datasets (typically less than 0.2 percent, often indistinguishable from zero) and most costly on smaller datasets with extensive constraint coverage (around 2-3 percent). Thus, appropriately specified monotonicity constraints can often deliver interpretability with small accuracy losses, particularly in large-scale credit portfolios."}

Human drivers typically choose to cross or drive over the low-profile obstacles (e.g., plastic bags) to efficiently navigate through narrow spaces, while existing planners neglect obstacle attributes, causing inefficiency or path-finding failures. To address this, we propose a trajectory planning framework integrating the 4WIS hybrid A* and Optimal Control Problem (OCP), in which the hybrid A* provides an initial path to enhance the OCP solution. Specifically, a multimodal classification network is introduced to assess scene complexity (hard/easy task) by fusing image and vehicle state data. For hard tasks, guided points are set to decompose complex tasks into local subtasks, improving the search efficiency of 4WIS hybrid A*. The multiple steering modes of 4WIS vehicles (Ackermann, diagonal, and zero-turn) are also incorporated into node expansion and heuristic designs. Moreover, a hierarchical obstacle handling strategy is designed to guide the node expansion considering obstacle attributes, i.e., 'non-traversable', 'crossable', and 'drive-over' obstacles. It allows crossing or driving over obstacles instead of the 'avoid-only' strategy, greatly enhancing success rates of pathfinding. We also design a logical constraint for the 'drive-over' obstacle by limiting its velocity to ensure safety. Furthermore, to address dynamic obstacles with motion uncertainty, we introduce a probabilistic risk field model, constructing risk-aware driving corridors that serve as linear collision constraints in OCP. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness in generating safe, efficient, and smooth trajectories for 4WIS vehicles, especially in constrained environments."}

We address this limitation by proposing a novel method that leverages on explicit graph representations for parts and present a co-part object discovery algorithm. We then introduce three benchmarks to evaluate the robustness of object-centric methods in recognizing multi-part objects within occluded and out-of-distribution settings. Experimental results on simulated, realistic, and real-world images show marked improvements in the quality of discovered objects compared to state-of-the-art methods, as well as the accurate recognition of multi-part objects in occluded and out-of-distribution contexts. We also show that the discovered object-centric representations can more accurately predict key object properties in a downstream task, highlighting the potential of our method to advance the field of object-centric representations."}

We extend the model to few-shot learning scenarios by first pre-training a convolutional neural operator using a source dataset and then adjusting the parameters of the trained neural operator using only a small target dataset. We investigate three strategies for adjusting the parameters of a trained neural operator, including fine-tuning, low-rank adaption, and neuron linear transformation, and find that the neuron linear transformation strategy enjoys the highest surrogate accuracy in solving PDEs such as Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, Brusselator diffusion-reaction system, and Navier-Stokes equations."}

Disagreement acts as a proxy for epistemic uncertainty and drives the agent toward under-explored driving situations, while an imagination-based actor-critic learns a planner-free exploration policy directly from the learned world model. After intrinsic pretraining, we evaluate zero-shot transfer by freezing all parameters and deploying the pretrained exploration policy in unseen towns and routes. We then study few-shot adaptation by training a task policy with limited extrinsic feedback for downstream objectives (lane following and collision avoidance). Experiments in CARLA across towns, routes, and traffic densities show that disagreement-based pretraining yields stronger zero-shot robustness and robust few-shot collision avoidance under town shift and matched interaction budgets, supporting the use of intrinsic disagreement as a practical reward-free pretraining signal for reusable driving world models."}

We present CodeGEMM, a codebook-centric GEMM kernel that replaces dequantization with precomputed inner products between centroids and activations stored in a lightweight Psumbook. At inference, code indices directly gather these partial sums, eliminating per-element lookups and reducing the on-chip footprint.

This study developed a quantitative framework to evaluate the spatial openness in housing from two- (2D) and three- (3D) dimensional perspectives. Using data from 4,004 rental units in Tokyo's 23 wards, we examined the temporal and spatial variations in openness and its relationship with rent and housing attributes. 2D openness was computed via planar visibility using visibility graph analysis (VGA) from floor plans, whereas 3D openness was derived from interior images analysed using Mask2Former, a semantic segmentation model that identifies walls, ceilings, floors, and windows. The results showed an increase in living room visibility and a 1990s peak in overall openness. Spatial analyses revealed partial correlations among openness, rent, and building characteristics, reflecting urban redevelopment trends. Although the 2D and 3D openness indicators were not directly correlated, higher openness tended to correspond to higher rent. The impression scores predicted by the existing models were only weakly related to openness, suggesting that the interior design and furniture more strongly shape perceived space.

We propose an adaptation framework built upon a Masked Autoencoder backbone and evaluate its performance under a Leave-One-Dataset-Out validation protocol across five open HAR datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that both LoRA and QLoRA can match the recognition performance of full fine-tuning while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, memory usage, and training time. Further analyses reveal that LoRA maintains robust performance even under limited supervision and that the adapter rank provides a controllable trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. QLoRA extends these benefits by reducing the memory footprint of frozen weights through quantization, with minimal impact on classification quality."}

Testing on an Arabic-finetuned model reveals that the bias persists despite right-to-left language training, ruling out language reading direction as the primary cause.

In particular, with the rise of these approaches, studies have shown that users exhibit different POI choices in their familiar and unfamiliar areas, highlighting the importance of incorporating user familiarity into predictive models. However, existing methods often fail to distinguish between the movements of users in familiar and unfamiliar regions. To address this, we propose MoE-TransMov, a Transformer-based model with a Transformer model with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture designed to use one framework to capture distinct mobility patterns across different moving contexts without requiring separate training for certain data. Using user-check-in data, we classify movements into familiar and unfamiliar categories and develop a specialized expert network to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach integrates self-attention mechanisms and adaptive gating networks to dynamically select the most relevant expert models for different mobility contexts. Experiments on two real-world datasets, including the widely used but small open-source Foursquare NYC dataset and the large-scale Kyoto dataset collected with LY Corporation (Yahoo Japan Corporation), show that MoE-TransMov outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with notable improvements in Top-1, Top-5, Top-10 accuracy, and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Given the results, we find that by using this approach, we can efficiently improve mobility predictions under different moving contexts, thereby enhancing the personalization of recommendation systems and advancing various urban applications."}

Federated Learning (FL), in which raw data never leaves local devices, has shown promise in overcoming these limitations.

In this paper, we propose FedOAED, a novel federated learning algorithm designed to mitigate client-drift arising from multiple local training updates and the variance induced by partial client participation. FedOAED incorporates an on-device autoencoder denoiser on the client side to mitigate client-drift and variance resulting from heterogeneous data under limited client availability.

To address this issue, this paper presents a Disengagement-Triggered Contrastive Continual Learning (DTCCL) framework that enables autonomous buses to improve planning policies through real-world operation. Each disengagement triggers cloud-based data augmentation that generates positive and negative samples by perturbing surrounding agents while preserving route context. Contrastive learning refines policy representations to better distinguish safe and unsafe behaviors, and continual updates are applied in a cloud-edge loop without human supervision. Experiments on urban bus routes demonstrate that DTCCL improves overall planning performance by 48.6 percent compared with direct retraining, validating its effectiveness for scalable, closed-loop policy improvement in autonomous public transport."}

We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \\textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN.

However, traditional studies rely heavily on expert knowledge, which is often time-consuming and inefficient. Intelligent analysis methods have made progress in various fields of archaeology, but there remains a research gap in data and methods in archaeobotany, especially in the classification task of ancient plant seeds. To address this, we construct the first Ancient Plant Seed Image Classification (APS) dataset. It contains 8,340 images from 17 genus- or species-level seed categories excavated from 18 archaeological sites across China. In addition, we design a framework specifically for the ancient plant seed classification task (APSNet), which introduces the scale feature (size) of seeds based on learning fine-grained information to guide the network in discovering key \"evidence\" for sufficient classification.

As these systems are increasingly deployed in critical areas, ensuring their privacy and alignment with human values is paramount. Recently, selective forgetting (also known as machine unlearning) has shown promise for privacy and data removal tasks, and has emerged as a transformative paradigm shift in the field of AI. It refers to the ability of a model to selectively erase the influence of previously seen data, which is especially important for compliance with modern data protection regulations and for aligning models with human values. Despite its promise, selective forgetting raises significant privacy concerns, especially when the data involved come from sensitive domains. While new unlearning-induced privacy attacks are continuously proposed, each is shown to outperform its predecessors using different experimental settings, which can lead to overly optimistic and potentially unfair assessments that may disproportionately favor one particular attack over the others. In this work, we present the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating privacy vulnerabilities in selective forgetting. We extensively investigate privacy vulnerabilities of machine unlearning techniques and benchmark privacy leakage across a wide range of victim data, state-of-the-art unlearning privacy attacks, unlearning methods, and model architectures. We systematically evaluate and identify critical factors related to unlearning-induced privacy leakage.

Conventional approaches are not only inefficient in data utilization and training processes but also exhibit limited performance when tracking highly dynamic motions. To address these challenges, we propose EGM, a framework that enables efficient learning of a general motion tracking policy. EGM integrates four core designs. Firstly, we introduce a Bin-based Cross-motion Curriculum Adaptive Sampling strategy to dynamically orchestrate the sampling probabilities based on tracking error of each motion bin, eficiently balancing the training process across motions with varying dificulty and durations. The sampled data is then processed by our proposed Composite Decoupled Mixture-of-Experts (CDMoE) architecture, which efficiently enhances the ability to track motions from different distributions by grouping experts separately for upper and lower body and decoupling orthogonal experts from shared experts to separately handle dedicated features and general features. Central to our approach is a key insight we identified: for training a general motion tracking policy, data quality and diversity are paramount. Building on these designs, we develop a three-stage curriculum training flow to progressively enhance the policy's robustness against disturbances. Despite training on only 4.08 hours of data, EGM generalized robustly across 49.25 hours of test motions, outperforming baselines on both routine and highly dynamic tasks."}

Most existing approaches rely on deterministic embeddings or black-box predictive models, offering limited uncertainty quantification and little insight into what latent representations encode. We propose a probabilistic digital twin framework in which each user is modeled as a latent stochastic state that generates observed behavioral data. The digital twin is learned via amortized variational inference, enabling scalable posterior estimation while retaining a fully probabilistic interpretation. We instantiate this framework using a variational autoencoder (VAE) applied to a user-response dataset designed to capture stable aspects of user identity. Beyond standard reconstruction-based evaluation, we introduce a statistically grounded interpretation pipeline that links latent dimensions to observable behavioral patterns. By analyzing users at the extremes of each latent dimension and validating differences using nonparametric hypothesis tests and effect sizes, we demonstrate that specific dimensions correspond to interpretable traits such as opinion strength and decisiveness. Empirically, we find that user structure is predominantly continuous rather than discretely clustered, with weak but meaningful structure emerging along a small number of dominant latent axes. These results suggest that probabilistic digital twins can provide interpretable, uncertainty-aware representations that go beyond deterministic user embeddings."}

To address this challenge, we propose a novel protection method that jointly optimizes privacy suppression and utility preservation under a visual consistency constraint. While our method is conceptually effective, fair comparisons between methods remain challenging due to the lack of publicly available evaluation datasets. To fill this gap, we introduce VPI-COCO, a publicly available benchmark comprising 522 images with hierarchically structured privacy questions and corresponding non-private counterparts, enabling fine-grained and joint evaluation of protection methods in terms of privacy preservation and user experience. Building upon this benchmark, experiments on multiple VLMs demonstrate that our method effectively reduces PAR below 25%, keeps NPAR above 88%, maintains high visual consistency, and generalizes well to unseen and paraphrased privacy questions, demonstrating its strong practical applicability for real-world VLM deployments."}

In this paper, we propose a visual dark pattern detection framework that improves both detection accuracy and real-time performance. To this end, we constructed a proprietary visual object detection dataset by manually collecting 4,066 UI/UX screenshots containing dark patterns from 194 websites across six major industrial sectors in South Korea and abroad.

Recent advances have spurred significant interest in multimodal place recognition (MPR), which leverages complementary strengths of multiple modalities. Despite its potential, most existing MPR methods still face three key challenges: (1) dynamically adapting to arbitrary modality inputs within a unified framework, (2) maintaining robustness with missing or degraded modalities, and (3) generalizing across diverse sensor configurations and setups. In this paper, we propose UniMPR, a unified framework for multimodal place recognition. Using only one trained model, it can seamlessly adapt to any combination of common perceptual modalities (e.g., camera, LiDAR, radar). To tackle the data heterogeneity, we unify all inputs within a polar BEV feature space. Subsequently, the polar BEVs are fed into a multi-branch network to exploit discriminative intra-model and inter-modal features from any modality combinations. To fully exploit the network's generalization capability and robustness, we construct a large-scale training set from multiple datasets and introduce an adaptive label assignment strategy for extensive pre-training. Experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that UniMPR achieves state-of-the-art performance under varying sensor configurations, modality combinations, and environmental conditions. Our code will be released at https://github.com/QiZS-BIT/UniMPR."}

We introduce TraCeR, a transformer-based survival analysis framework for incorporating longitudinal covariates. Based on a factorized self-attention architecture, TraCeR estimates the hazard function from a sequence of measurements, naturally capturing temporal covariate interactions without assumptions about the underlying data-generating process. The framework is inherently designed to handle censored data and competing events. Experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that TraCeR achieves substantial and statistically significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our evaluation extends beyond discrimination metrics and assesses model calibration, addressing a key oversight in literature."}

This requires robots to perceive and reason over the current task scene through multiple modalities, and to plan their behaviors to achieve their intended goals. Traditional robotic task-planning approaches often struggle to bridge low-level execution with high-level task reasoning, and cannot dynamically update task strategies when instructions change during execution, which ultimately limits their versatility and adaptability to new tasks. In this work, we propose a novel language model-based framework for dynamic robot task planning. Our Vision-Language-Policy (VLP) model, based on a vision-language model fine-tuned on real-world data, can interpret semantic instructions and integrate reasoning over the current task scene to generate behavior policies that control the robot to accomplish the task. Moreover, it can dynamically adjust the task strategy in response to changes in the task, enabling flexible adaptation to evolving task requirements. Experiments conducted with different robots and a variety of real-world tasks show that the trained model can efficiently adapt to novel scenarios and dynamically update its policy, demonstrating strong planning autonomy and cross-embodiment generalization.

Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical \"horizontal\" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate. Through evaluations conducted on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, our PACGNet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark, with mAP50 scores reaching 81.7% and 82.1% respectively."}

However, as organized crime groups are becoming more professional in real-world scenarios, fraudsters are employing more sophisticated camouflage strategies. Specifically, fraudsters disguise themselves by mimicking the behavioral data collected by platforms, ensuring that their key characteristics are consistent with those of benign users to a high degree, which we call Adaptive Camouflage. Consequently, this narrows the differences in behavioral traits between them and benign users within the platform's database, thereby making current GFD models lose efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a relation diffusion-based graph augmentation model Grad. In detail, Grad leverages a supervised graph contrastive learning module to enhance the fraud-benign difference and employs a guided relation diffusion generator to generate auxiliary homophilic relations from scratch. Based on these, weak fraudulent signals would be enhanced during the aggregation process, thus being obvious enough to be captured. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real-world datasets provided by WeChat Pay, one of the largest online payment platforms with billions of users, and three public datasets. The results show that our proposed model Grad outperforms SOTA methods in both various scenarios, achieving at most 11.10% and 43.95% increases in AUC and AP, respectively.

Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods.

Given an image and a user-provided mask, MatE first performs coarse rectification using an estimated depth map as a geometric prior, and then employs a dual-branch diffusion model. Leveraging a learned consistency from rotation-aligned and scale-aligned training data, this model further rectify residual distortions from the coarse result and translate it into a complete set of material maps, including albedo, normal, roughness and height. Our framework achieves invariance to the unknown illumination and perspective of the input image, allowing for the recovery of intrinsic material properties from casual captures.

Efficient Data Pruning for Large-scale Autonomous Driving Dataset via Trajectory Entropy Maximization", "comment": "7 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "Collecting large-scale naturalistic driving data is essential for training robust autonomous driving planners. However, real-world datasets often contain a substantial amount of repetitive and low-value samples, which lead to excessive storage costs and bring limited benefits to policy learning. To address this issue, we propose an information-theoretic data pruning method that effectively reduces the training data volume without compromising model performance. Our approach evaluates the trajectory distribution information entropy of driving data and iteratively selects high-value samples that preserve the statistical characteristics of the original dataset in a model-agnostic manner. From a theoretical perspective, we show that maximizing trajectory entropy effectively constrains the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the pruned subset and the original data distribution, thereby maintaining generalization ability. Comprehensive experiments on the NuPlan benchmark with a large-scale imitation learning framework demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the dataset size by up to 40% while maintaining closed-loop performance. This work provides a lightweight and theoretically grounded approach for scalable data management and efficient policy learning in autonomous driving systems."}

While recent advances in 3D reconstruction have enabled accurate approximations of scene geometry and appearance, these methods often fall short in relighting scenarios due to the lack of precise, spatially varying material parameters. At the same time, diffusion models operating on 2D images have shown strong performance in predicting physically based rendering (PBR) properties such as albedo, roughness, and metallicity. However, transferring these 2D material maps onto reconstructed 3D geometry remains a significant challenge. We propose a framework for fusing 2D material data into 3D geometry using a combination of novel learning-based and projection-based approaches. We begin by reconstructing scene geometry via Gaussian Splatting. From the input images, a diffusion model generates 2D maps for albedo, roughness, and metallic parameters. Any existing diffusion model that can convert images or videos to PBR materials can be applied. The predictions are further integrated into the 3D representation either by optimizing an image-based loss or by directly projecting the material parameters onto the Gaussians using Gaussian ray tracing. To enhance fine-scale accuracy and multi-view consistency, we further introduce a light-weight neural refinement step (Neural Merger), which takes ray-traced material features as input and produces detailed adjustments. Our results demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques in both quantitative metrics and perceived visual realism. This enables more accurate, relightable, and photorealistic renderings from reconstructed scenes, significantly improving the realism and efficiency of asset creation workflows in content production pipelines."}

Individual fairness has garnered traction in graph representation learning due to its practical importance in high-stakes Web areas such as user modeling, recommender systems, and search. However, existing methods assume the existence of predefined similarity information over all node pairs, an often unrealistic requirement that prevents their operationalization in practice. In this paper, we assume the similarity information is only available for a limited subset of node pairs and introduce FairExpand, a flexible framework that promotes individual fairness in this more realistic partial information scenario. FairExpand follows a two-step pipeline that alternates between refining node representations using a backbone model (e.g., a graph neural network) and gradually propagating similarity information, which allows fairness enforcement to effectively expand to the entire graph. Extensive experiments show that FairExpand consistently enhances individual fairness while preserving performance, making it a practical solution for enabling graph-based individual fairness in real-world applications with partial similarity information."}

The Generalized Resolution--Shell Dynamics (GRSD) framework models learning as spectral energy transport across logarithmic resolution shells, providing a coarse--grained dynamical description of training. Within GRSD, power--law scaling corresponds to a particularly simple renormalized shell dynamics; however, such behavior is not automatic and requires additional structural properties of the learning process.\n  In this work, we identify a set of sufficient conditions under which the GRSD shell dynamics admits a renormalizable coarse--grained description. These conditions constrain the learning configuration at multiple levels, including boundedness of gradient propagation in the computation graph, weak functional incoherence at initialization, controlled Jacobian evolution along training, and log--shift invariance of renormalized shell couplings. We further show that power--law scaling does not follow from renormalizability alone, but instead arises as a rigidity consequence: once log--shift invariance is combined with the intrinsic time--rescaling covariance of gradient flow, the renormalized GRSD velocity field is forced into a power--law form."}

While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks.

We attribute this effect to the weak alignment between policy performance and test loss, revealing substantial room for improvement through data selection. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective method, Stepwise Dual Ranking (SDR), which extracts a compact yet informative subset from large-scale offline behavioral datasets.

Extensive experiments and ablation studies on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that SDR significantly enhances data selection for offline behavioral data."}

To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x. Moreover, experimental results on height and texture editing demonstrate the framework's flexibility and extensibility, indicating its potential to serve as a unified data generation framework."}

However, state-of-the-art zero-shot methods typically rely on a sequence of surrogate likelihood functions, whose scores are used as proxies for the ideal score. This procedure however requires vector-Jacobian products through the denoiser at every reverse step, introducing significant memory and runtime overhead. To address this issue, we propose a new likelihood surrogate that yields simple and efficient to sample Gaussian posterior transitions, sidestepping the backpropagation through the denoiser network.

LoRA trains two ``adapter\" matrices that form a low-rank representation of the model parameters, thereby massively reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated at every step. Although LoRA is simple, its convergence is poorly understood due to the lack of Lipschitz smoothness, a key condition for classic convergence analyses. As a result, current theoretical results only consider asymptotic behavior or assume strong boundedness conditions which artificially enforce Lipschitz smoothness. In this work, we provide for the first time a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of the \\textit{original LoRA gradient descent} algorithm, which reflects widespread practice, without such assumptions. Our work relies on three key steps: i) reformulating the problem in terms of the outer product of the stacked adapter matrices, ii) a modified descent lemma for the ``Lipschitz-like\" reparametrized function, and iii) controlling the step size. With this approach, we prove that LoRA gradient descent converges to a stationary point at rate $O(\\frac{1}{\\log T})$, where $T$ is the number of iterations."}

While most research focuses on enhancing the task-understanding abilities of LLMs/VLMs through fine-tuning or chain-of-thought prompting, this paper argues that defining the planned skill set is equally crucial. To handle the complexity of daily environments, the skill set should possess a high degree of generalization ability. Empirically, more abstract expressions tend to be more generalizable. Therefore, we propose to abstract the planned result as a set of meta-actions. Each meta-action comprises three components: {move/rotate, end-effector status change, relationship with the environment}. This abstraction replaces human-centric concepts, such as grasping or pushing, with the robot's intrinsic functionalities. As a result, the planned outcomes align seamlessly with the complete range of actions that the robot is capable of performing. Furthermore, to ensure that the LLM/VLM accurately produces the desired meta-action format, we employ the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique, which leverages a database of human-annotated planning demonstrations to facilitate in-context learning. As the system successfully completes more tasks, the database will self-augment to continue supporting diversity. The meta-action set and its integration with RAG are two novel contributions of our planner, denoted as MaP-AVR, the meta-action planner for agents composed of VLM and RAG. To validate its efficacy, we design experiments using GPT-4o as the pre-trained LLM/VLM model and OmniGibson as our robotic platform.

Existing approaches focus solely on updating a single scene without supporting novel-state synthesis. Others rely on diffusion-based object-background decoupling that works on one state at a time and cannot fuse information across multiple observations. To address these limitations, we introduce RecurGS, a recurrent fusion framework that incrementally integrates discrete Gaussian scene states into a single evolving representation capable of interaction. RecurGS detects object-level changes across consecutive states, aligns their geometric motion using semantic correspondence and Lie-algebra based SE(3) refinement, and performs recurrent updates that preserve historical structures through replay supervision. A voxelized, visibility-aware fusion module selectively incorporates newly observed regions while keeping stable areas fixed, mitigating catastrophic forgetting and enabling efficient long-horizon updates. RecurGS supports object-level manipulation, synthesizes novel scene states without requiring additional scans, and maintains photorealistic fidelity across evolving environments. Extensive experiments across synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework delivers high-quality reconstructions with substantially improved update efficiency, providing a scalable step toward continuously interactive Gaussian worlds."}

To address this, we introduce LeJOT, an intelligent job cost orchestration framework that leverages machine learning for execution time prediction and a solver-based optimization model for real-time resource allocation. Unlike conventional scheduling techniques, LeJOT proactively predicts workload demands, dynamically allocates computing resources, and minimizes costs while ensuring performance requirements are met.

Mosaics are an ancient art form created by arranging small pieces, called tesserae, on a surface using adhesive.

This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics. Due to the limited open datasets in the field, we also create an annotated dataset of mosaic images to fine-tune and evaluate the model. Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02. The notable performance of the fine-tuned SAM 2 model together with the newly annotated dataset can pave the way for real-time segmentation of mosaic images."}

In this work, we propose AL GNN, a novel framework for continual graph learning that eliminates the need for backpropagation and replay buffers.

Existing multi-prompt learning methods primarily focus on utilizing various meticulously designed prompts within a single foundation vision-language model to achieve superior performance. However, the overlooked model-prompt matching bias hinders the development of multi-prompt learning, i.e., the same prompt can convey different semantics across distinct vision-language models, such as CLIP-ViT-B/16 and CLIP-ViT-B/32, resulting in inconsistent predictions of identical prompt. To mitigate the impact of this bias on downstream tasks, we explore an ensemble learning approach to sufficiently aggregate the benefits of diverse predictions. Additionally, we further disclose the presence of sample-prompt matching bias, which originates from the prompt-irrelevant semantics encapsulated in the input samples. Thus, directly utilizing all information from the input samples for generating weights of ensemble learning can lead to suboptimal performance. In response, we extract prompt-relevant semantics from input samples by leveraging the guidance of the information theory-based analysis, adaptively calculating debiased ensemble weights. Overall, we propose Adaptive-Debiased Ensemble MultiPrompt Learning, abbreviated as AmPLe, to mitigate the two types of bias simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three representative tasks, i.e., generalization to novel classes, new target datasets, and unseen domain shifts, show that AmPLe can widely outperform existing methods. Theoretical validation from a causal perspective further supports the effectiveness of AmPLe."}

Starting from first principles with SGD and adaptive gradient methods, the analysis progressively uncovers the limitations of these conventional approaches when confronted with anisotropy that is representative of real-world data. These breakdowns motivate the exploration of sophisticated alternatives rooted in curvature information: second-order approximation techniques, layer-wise preconditioning, adaptive learning rates, and more. Next, the interplay between these optimization algorithms and the broader neural network training toolkit, which includes prior and recent developments such as maximal update parametrization, learning rate schedules, and exponential moving averages, emerges as equally essential to empirical success. To bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical deployment, this paper offers practical prescriptions and implementation strategies for integrating these methods into modern deep learning workflows."}

Traditional modular pipelines suffer from latency and cascading errors across perception, localization, mapping, and planning modules. Recent end-to-end learning methods map raw visual observations directly to control signals or trajectories, promising greater performance and efficiency in open-world settings. However, most prior end-to-end approaches still rely on separate localization modules that depend on accurate sensor extrinsic calibration for self-state estimation, thereby limiting generalization across embodiments and environments. We introduce LoGoPlanner, a localization-grounded, end-to-end navigation framework that addresses these limitations by: (1) finetuning a long-horizon visual-geometry backbone to ground predictions with absolute metric scale, thereby providing implicit state estimation for accurate localization; (2) reconstructing surrounding scene geometry from historical observations to supply dense, fine-grained environmental awareness for reliable obstacle avoidance; and (3) conditioning the policy on implicit geometry bootstrapped by the aforementioned auxiliary tasks, thereby reducing error propagation.We evaluate LoGoPlanner in both simulation and real-world settings, where its fully end-to-end design reduces cumulative error while metric-aware geometry memory enhances planning consistency and obstacle avoidance, leading to more than a 27.3\\% improvement over oracle-localization baselines and strong generalization across embodiments and environments.

However, such representations often fail to capture fine-grained object semantics and appearance, which are crucial for localizing moments described by object-oriented queries involving specific entities and their interactions. In particular, temporal dynamics at the object level have been largely overlooked, limiting the effectiveness of existing approaches in scenarios requiring detailed object-level reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose a novel object-centric framework for moment retrieval. Our method first extracts query-relevant objects using a scene graph parser and then generates scene graphs from video frames to represent these objects and their relationships. Based on the scene graphs, we construct object-level feature sequences that encode rich visual and semantic information. These sequences are processed by a relational tracklet transformer, which models spatio-temporal correlations among objects over time. By explicitly capturing object-level state changes, our framework enables more accurate localization of moments aligned with object-oriented queries. We evaluated our method on three benchmarks: Charades-STA, QVHighlights, and TACoS. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks."}

First, we characterize the optimal switching time in stylized settings and derive closed-form expressions that quantify how horizon length, learning-curve curvature, and cost differentials shape the optimal decision. Second, we propose three practical algorithms: a one-shot baseline, a greedy sequential method, and a look-ahead sequential method. Using a real-world credit-scoring dataset with gradually arriving alternative data, we show that (i) optimal switching times vary systematically with cost parameters and learning-curve behavior, and (ii) the look-ahead sequential method outperforms other methods and is able to approach in value an oracle with full foresight. Finally, we establish finite-sample guarantees, including conditions under which the sequential look-ahead method achieve sublinear regret relative to that oracle. Our results provide an operational blueprint for economically sound model transitions as new data sources become available."}

Our system begins with a Vision-Transformer (ViT) depth network trained with metric-scale supervision, giving globally consistent depths despite wide field-of-view variations. A multi-scale feature bundle-adjustment (BA) layer refines camera poses directly in feature space--leveraging learned pyramidal descriptors instead of brittle keypoints--to suppress drift on unconstrained trajectories. For scene representation, we deploy an incremental local-radiance-field hierarchy: new hash-grid NeRFs are allocated and frozen on-the-fly when view overlap falls below a threshold, enabling city-block-scale coverage on a single GPU. Evaluated on the Tanks and Temples benchmark, our method reduces Absolute Trajectory Error to 0.001-0.021 m across eight indoor-outdoor sequences--up to 18x lower than BARF and 2x lower than NoPe-NeRF--while maintaining sub-pixel Relative Pose Error.

Existing image-to-image translation methods primarily aim to learn mappings between domains, often generating diverse synthetic data with variations in anatomical scale and shape, but they usually overlook spatial correspondence during the translation process. For clinical applications, traceability, defined as the ability to provide pixel-level correspondences between original and translated images, is equally important. This property enhances clinical interpretability but has been largely overlooked in previous approaches. To address this gap, we propose Plasticine, which is, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end image-to-image translation framework explicitly designed with traceability as a core objective. Our method combines intensity translation and spatial transformation within a denoising diffusion framework. This design enables the generation of synthetic images with interpretable intensity transitions and spatially coherent deformations, supporting pixel-wise traceability throughout the translation process."}

However, handling high-dimensional visual features often incurs substantial computational and memory costs. VoCo-LLaMA alleviates this issue by compressing visual patch tokens into a few VoCo tokens, reducing computational overhead while preserving strong cross-modal alignment. Nevertheless, such approaches typically adopt a fixed compression rate, limiting their ability to adapt to varying levels of visual complexity. To address this limitation, we propose Adaptive-VoCo, a framework that augments VoCo-LLaMA with a lightweight predictor for adaptive compression. This predictor dynamically selects an optimal compression rate by quantifying an image's visual complexity using statistical cues from the vision encoder, such as patch token entropy and attention map variance. Furthermore, we introduce a joint loss function that integrates rate regularization with complexity alignment. This enables the model to balance inference efficiency with representational capacity, particularly in challenging scenarios. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms fixed-rate baselines across multiple multimodal tasks, highlighting the potential of adaptive visual compression for creating more efficient and robust VLMs."}

However, existing expert pruning approaches conventionally rely on local importance metrics and often apply uniform layer-wise pruning, leveraging only partial evaluation signals and overlooking the heterogeneous contributions of experts across layers. To address these limitations, we propose an expert pruning approach based on the trajectory of activated experts across layers, which treats MoE as a weighted computation graph and casts expert selection as a global optimal path planning problem. Within this framework, we integrate complementary importance signals from reconstruction error, routing probabilities, and activation strength at the trajectory level, which naturally yields non-uniform expert retention across layers. Experiments show that our approach achieves superior pruning performance on nearly all tasks compared with most existing approaches."}

Existing approaches such as CoOp or LoRA provide only partial remedies, as they remain confined to the pre-trained semantic space.\n  To overcome this bottleneck, we propose dynamic representation optimization, realized through the Guided Target-Matching Adaptation (GTMA) framework. At inference time, GTMA constructs a continuous pseudo-word embedding that best aligns with an OOD image's visual anchor, effectively bypassing vocabulary limitations. The optimization is driven by an adaptive gradient-based representation policy optimization algorithm, which incorporates semantic regularization to preserve plausibility and compatibility with the model's prior knowledge.\n  Experiments on ImageNet-R and the VISTA-Beyond benchmark demonstrate that GTMA improves zero-shot and few-shot OOD accuracy by up to 15-20 percent over the base VLM while maintaining performance on in-distribution concepts.

We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints.

In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters.

This paper presents a robust detection framework that leverages multiple uncertainty measures to decide whether to trust or reject a model's predictions. We focus on three complementary techniques: Fisher Information, which captures the sensitivity of model parameters to input variations; entropy-based uncertainty from Monte Carlo Dropout, which reflects predictive variability; and predictive variance from a Deep Kernel Learning framework using a Gaussian Process classifier. To integrate these diverse uncertainty signals, Particle Swarm Optimisation is used to learn optimal weightings and determine an adaptive rejection threshold. The model is trained on Stable Diffusion-generated images and evaluated on GLIDE, VQDM, Midjourney, BigGAN, and StyleGAN3, each introducing significant distribution shifts. While standard metrics such as prediction probability and Fisher-based measures perform well in distribution, their effectiveness degrades under shift. In contrast, the Combined Uncertainty measure consistently achieves an incorrect rejection rate of approximately 70 percent on unseen generators, successfully filtering most misclassified AI samples. Although the system occasionally rejects correct predictions from newer generators, this conservative behaviour is acceptable, as rejected samples can support retraining. The framework maintains high acceptance of accurate predictions for natural images and in-domain AI data. Under adversarial attacks using FGSM and PGD, the Combined Uncertainty method rejects around 61 percent of successful attacks, while GP-based uncertainty alone achieves up to 80 percent. Overall, the results demonstrate that multi-source uncertainty fusion provides a resilient and adaptive solution for AI-generated image detection."}

Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning."}

Emphasis is placed on how SOM handles multidimensional data and uncovers hidden patterns to support effective water management. The growing availability of environmental data from in-situ sensors, remote sensing imagery, IoT technologies, and historical records has significantly expanded analytical opportunities in environmental monitoring. SOM has proven effective in analysing complex datasets, particularly when labelled data are limited or unavailable. It enables high-dimensional data visualization, facilitates the detection of hidden ecological patterns, and identifies critical correlations among diverse water quality indicators. This review highlights SOMs versatility in ecological assessments, trophic state classification, algal bloom monitoring, and catchment area impact evaluations.

When experience is represented as a linear trajectory in Euclidean space, the geodesic distance between temporal events grows linearly with time, forcing the required covering number to diverge. In fixed-dimensional hardware, this volume expansion inevitably forces trajectory overlap, manifesting as catastrophic interference. In this work, we propose a geometric resolution to this paradox based on Recursive Metric Contraction. We formalize abstraction not as symbolic grouping, but as a topological deformation: a quotient map that collapses the metric tensor within validated temporal neighborhoods, effectively driving the diameter of local sub-manifolds to zero. We substantiate our framework with four rigorous results. First, the Bounded Capacity Theorem establishes that recursive quotient maps allow the embedding of arbitrarily long trajectories into bounded representational volumes, trading linear metric growth for logarithmic topological depth. Second, the Topological Collapse Separability Theorem, derived via Urysohn's Lemma, proves that recursive quotienting renders non-linearly separable temporal sequences linearly separable in the limit, bypassing the need for infinite-dimensional kernel projections. Third, the Parity-Partitioned Stability Theorem solves the catastrophic forgetting problem by proving that if the state space is partitioned into orthogonal flow and scaffold manifolds, the metric deformations of active learning do not disturb the stability of stored memories. Our analysis reveals that tokens in neural architectures are physically realizable as singularities or wormholes, regions of extreme positive curvature that bridge distant points in the temporal manifold."}

Recent increases in drought severity, frequency, and duration underscore the need for effective monitoring and mitigation strategies. Predicting drought impacts rather than drought conditions alone offers opportunities to support early warning systems and proactive decision-making. This study applies machine learning techniques to link drought indices with historical drought impact records (2005:2024) to generate short-term impact forecasts. By addressing key conceptual and data-driven challenges regarding temporal scale and impact quantification, the study aims to improve the predictability of drought impacts at actionable lead times. The Drought Severity and Coverage Index (DSCI) and the Evaporative Stress Index (ESI) were combined with impact data from the Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) to model and forecast weekly drought impacts. Results indicate that Fire and Relief impacts were predicted with the highest accuracy, followed by Agriculture and Water, while forecasts for Plants and Society impacts showed greater variability. County and state level forecasts for New Mexico were produced using an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that incorporated both DSCI and ESI. The model successfully generated forecasts up to eight weeks in advance using the preceding eight weeks of data for most impact categories. This work supports the development of an Ecological Drought Information Communication System (EcoDri) for New Mexico and demonstrates the potential for broader application in similar drought-prone regions. The findings can aid stakeholders, land managers, and decision-makers in developing and implementing more effective drought mitigation and adaptation strategies."}

This paper investigates the classification of synthetic graph families using a hybrid approach that combines GNNs with engineered graph-theoretic features. We generate a large and structurally diverse synthetic dataset comprising graphs from five representative generative families, Erdos-Renyi, Watts-Strogatz, Barab'asi-Albert, Holme-Kim, and Stochastic Block Model. These graphs range in size up to 1x10^4 nodes, containing up to 1.1x10^5 edges. A comprehensive range of node and graph level features is extracted for each graph and pruned using a Random Forest based feature selection pipeline. The features are integrated into six GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, GATv2, GIN, GraphSAGE and GTN. Each architecture is optimised for hyperparameter selection using Optuna. Finally, models were compared against a baseline Support Vector Machine (SVM) trained solely on the handcrafted features. Our evaluation demonstrates that GraphSAGE and GTN achieve the highest classification performance, with 98.5% accuracy, and strong class separation evidenced by t-SNE and UMAP visualisations. GCN and GIN also performed well, while GAT-based models lagged due to limitations in their ability to capture global structures.

Evaluating the dynamics in such models is key to understanding their learned generative mechanisms. However, such evaluation is impeded by two major challenges: First, comparison of learned dynamics across models is difficult because there is no enforced equivalence of their coordinate systems. Second, identification of mechanistically important low-dimensional motifs (e.g., limit sets) is intractable in high-dimensional nonlinear models such as RNNs. Here, we propose a comprehensive framework to address these two issues, termed Diffeomorphic vector field alignment FOR learned Models (DFORM). DFORM learns a nonlinear coordinate transformation between the state spaces of two dynamical systems, which aligns their trajectories in a maximally one-to-one manner. In so doing, DFORM enables an assessment of whether two models exhibit topological equivalence, i.e., similar mechanisms despite differences in coordinate systems. A byproduct of this method is a means to locate dynamical motifs on low-dimensional manifolds embedded within higher-dimensional systems. We verified DFORM's ability to identify linear and nonlinear coordinate transformations using canonical topologically equivalent systems, RNNs, and systems related by nonlinear flows. DFORM was also shown to provide a quantification of similarity between topologically distinct systems. We then demonstrated that DFORM can locate important dynamical motifs including invariant manifolds and saddle limit sets within high-dimensional models. Finally, using a set of RNN models trained on human functional MRI (fMRI) recordings, we illustrated that DFORM can identify limit cycles from high-dimensional data-driven models, which agreed well with prior numerical analysis."}

Moreover, their performance heavily depends on degradation recognition models that require extensive annotations for training, limiting their applicability in label-free environments. To address these limitations, we propose a policy optimization-based restoration framework that learns an lightweight agent to determine tool-calling sequences. The agent operates in a sequential decision process, selecting the most appropriate restoration operation at each step to maximize final image quality. To enable training within label-free environments, we introduce a novel reward mechanism driven by multimodal large language models, which act as human-aligned evaluator and provide perceptual feedback for policy improvement. Once trained, our agent executes a deterministic restoration plans without redundant tool invocations, significantly accelerating inference while maintaining high restoration quality.

To bridge this critical gap, we present REALM (REalistic AI Learning for Multiphysics), a rigorous benchmarking framework designed to test neural surrogates on challenging, application-driven reactive flows. REALM features 11 high-fidelity datasets spanning from canonical multiphysics problems to complex propulsion and fire safety scenarios, alongside a standardized end-to-end training and evaluation protocol that incorporates multiphysics-aware preprocessing and a robust rollout strategy. Using this framework, we systematically benchmark over a dozen representative surrogate model families, including spectral operators, convolutional models, Transformers, pointwise operators, and graph/mesh networks, and identify three robust trends: (i) a scaling barrier governed jointly by dimensionality, stiffness, and mesh irregularity, leading to rapidly growing rollout errors; (ii) performance primarily controlled by architectural inductive biases rather than parameter count; and (iii) a persistent gap between nominal accuracy metrics and physically trustworthy behavior, where models with high correlations still miss key transient structures and integral quantities. Taken together, REALM exposes the limits of current neural surrogates on realistic multiphysics flows and offers a rigorous testbed to drive the development of next-generation physics-aware architectures."}

The framework introduces a parameter-efficient LoRA-based neural signal injection module that independently processes each conditioning signal as a pluggable component, facilitating flexible multi-modal conditioning without altering base model parameters. Additionally, we employ a causal attention mechanism accommodate the long-sequence modeling demands of conditional generation tasks. Existing neural-driven generation research predominantly focuses on textual modalities as conditions or intermediate representations, resulting in limited exploration of visual modalities as direct conditioning signals. To bridge this research gap, we introduce the EEG-Style dataset. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across public benchmarks and self-collected neural signal datasets: (1) EEG-driven image generation on the public CVPR40 dataset; (2) neural signal-guided image editing on the public Loongx dataset for semantic-aware local modifications; and (3) EEG-driven style transfer on our self-collected EEG-Style dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in generation fidelity, editing consistency, and style transfer quality while maintaining low computational overhead and strong scalability to additional modalities.

Unlike traditional supervised classification, ZSL typically relies on learning a mapping from visual features to predefined, human-understandable class concepts. While ZSL models promise to improve generalization and interpretability, their robustness under systematic input perturbations remain unclear. In this study, we present an empirical analysis about the robustness of existing ZSL methods at both classlevel and concept-level. Specifically, we successfully disrupted their class prediction by the well-known non-target class attack (clsA). However, in the Generalized Zero-shot Learning (GZSL) setting, we observe that the success of clsA is only at the original best-calibrated point. After the attack, the optimal bestcalibration point shifts, and ZSL models maintain relatively strong performance at other calibration points, indicating that clsA results in a spurious attack success in the GZSL. To address this, we propose the Class-Bias Enhanced Attack (CBEA), which completely eliminates GZSL accuracy across all calibrated points by enhancing the gap between seen and unseen class probabilities.Next, at concept-level attack, we introduce two novel attack modes: Class-Preserving Concept Attack (CPconA) and NonClass-Preserving Concept Attack (NCPconA). Our extensive experiments evaluate three typical ZSL models across various architectures from the past three years and reveal that ZSL models are vulnerable not only to the traditional class attack but also to concept-based attacks. These attacks allow malicious actors to easily manipulate class predictions by erasing or introducing concepts. Our findings highlight a significant performance gap between existing approaches, emphasizing the need for improved adversarial robustness in current ZSL models."}

In this work, we treat interactions as the fundamental units of such structure and investigate a largely unexplored question: how DNNs encode interactions under different levels of contextual complexity, and how these microscopic interaction patterns shape macroscopic representation capacity. To quantify this complexity, we use multi-order interactions [57], where each order reflects the amount of contextual information required to evaluate the joint interaction utility of a variable pair. This formulation enables a stratified analysis of cooperative patterns learned by DNNs. Building on this formulation, we develop a comprehensive study of interaction structure in DNNs. (i) We empirically discover a universal interaction bottleneck: across architectures and tasks, DNNs easily learn low-order and high-order interactions but consistently under-represent mid-order ones. (ii) We theoretically explain this bottleneck by proving that mid-order interactions incur the highest contextual variability, yielding large gradient variance and making them intrinsically difficult to learn. (iii) We further modulate the bottleneck by introducing losses that steer models toward emphasizing interactions of selected orders. Finally, we connect microscopic interaction structures with macroscopic representational behavior: low-order-emphasized models exhibit stronger generalization and robustness, whereas high-order-emphasized models demonstrate greater structural modeling and fitting capability. Together, these results uncover an inherent representational bias in modern DNNs and establish interaction order as a powerful lens for interpreting and guiding deep representations."}

Our key idea is to integrate physically guided illumination modeling with geometry-appearance decoupling for consistent low-light reconstruction. Specifically, we adopt a dual-branch predictor that provides stable geometric initialization of 3D Gaussian parameters. On the appearance side, illumination consistency leverages frequency priors to enable controllable and cross-view coherent lighting, while an appearance refinement module further separates illumination, material, and view-dependent cues to recover fine texture. To tackle the lack of large-scale geometrically consistent paired data, we synthesize dark views via a physics-based camera model for training. Extensive experiments on public and self-collected datasets demonstrate that SplatBright achieves superior novel view synthesis, cross-view consistency, and better generalization to unseen low-light scenes compared with both 2D and 3D methods."}

Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigm paradox: the more deterministic and structured the time series, the more severe the bias by point-wise loss function. We derive the first closed-form quantification for the non-deterministic EOB across linear and non-linear systems, and prove EOB is an intrinsic data property, governed exclusively by sequence length and our proposed Structural Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SSNR). This theoretical diagnosis motivates our principled debiasing program that eliminates the bias through sequence length reduction and structural orthogonalization. We present a concrete solution that simultaneously achieves both principles via DFT or DWT.

While several methods for hallucination mitigation have been proposed, they often compromise the model's capacity for video understanding and reasoning. In this work, we propose SmartSight, a pioneering step to address this issue in a training-free manner by leveraging the model's own introspective capabilities. Specifically, SmartSight generates multiple candidate responses to uncover low-hallucinated outputs that are often obscured by standard greedy decoding. It assesses the hallucination of each response using the Temporal Attention Collapse score, which measures whether the model over-focuses on trivial temporal regions of the input video when generating the response. To improve efficiency, SmartSight identifies the Visual Attention Vanishing point, enabling more accurate hallucination estimation and early termination of hallucinated responses, leading to a substantial reduction in decoding cost. Experiments show that SmartSight substantially lowers hallucinations for Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 10.59% on VRIPT-HAL, while simultaneously enhancing video understanding and reasoning, boosting performance on VideoMMMU by up to 8.86%. These results highlight SmartSight's effectiveness in improving the reliability of open-source Video-LLMs."}

In this work, we study how the choice of pretraining data distribution steers a shallow transformer toward one behavior or the other. Focusing on a minimal trigger-output prediction task -- copying the token immediately following a special trigger upon its second occurrence -- we present a rigorous analysis of gradient-based training of a single-layer transformer. In both the infinite and finite sample regimes, we prove a transition in the learned mechanism: if input sequences exhibit sufficient diversity, measured by a low ``max-sum'' ratio of trigger-to-trigger distances, the trained model implements an induction head and generalizes to unseen contexts; by contrast, when this ratio is large, the model resorts to a positional shortcut and fails to generalize out-of-distribution (OOD). We also reveal a trade-off between the pretraining context length and OOD generalization, and derive the optimal pretraining distribution that minimizes computational cost per sample. Finally, we validate our theoretical predictions with controlled synthetic experiments, demonstrating that broadening context distributions robustly induces induction heads and enables OOD generalization. Our results shed light on the algorithmic biases of pretrained transformers and offer conceptual guidelines for data-driven control of their learned behaviors."}

A lightweight timestep prediction module (TPM), trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), selects a more feasible conditioning timestep based on the current state, effectively choosing a desired noise level to control image detail and textural richness. At deployment, a scaling hyper-parameter can be used to interpolate between the original and de-synchronized timesteps, enabling conservative or aggressive adjustments.

However, these methods struggle in the conformity between generated samples and expected categories, which could introduce label noise and severely limit their effectiveness in applications. To address this issue, we propose RiskyDiff that incorporates the embeddings of both texts and images as implicit constraints of category conformity. We also design a conformity score to further explicitly strengthen the category conformity, as well as introduce the mechanisms of embedding screening and risky gradient guidance to boost the risk of generated samples. Extensive experiments reveal that RiskyDiff greatly outperforms existing methods in terms of the degree of risk, generation quality, and conformity with conditioned categories. We also empirically show the generalization ability of the models can be enhanced by augmenting training data with generated samples of high conformity."}

Recent remarkable advancements in deep learning have undeniably brought about substantial performance improvements in these fields. Nevertheless, existing methods mainly rely on task-specific architectures. This significantly restricts their generalization ability and effective application across a wide range of different tasks. In this paper, we introduce the Unified Rectification Framework (UniRect), a comprehensive approach that addresses these practical tasks from a consistent distortion rectification perspective. Our approach incorporates various task-specific inverse problems into a general distortion model by simulating different types of lenses. To handle diverse distortions, UniRect adopts one task-agnostic rectification framework with a dual-component structure: a {Deformation Module}, which utilizes a novel Residual Progressive Thin-Plate Spline (RP-TPS) model to address complex geometric deformations, and a subsequent Restoration Module, which employs Residual Mamba Blocks (RMBs) to counteract the degradation caused by the deformation process and enhance the fidelity of the output image. Moreover, a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) structure is designed to circumvent heavy task competition in multi-task learning due to varying distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our models have achieved state-of-the-art performance compared with other up-to-date methods."}

Given that interference effects introduce unpredictability in scheduling, neglecting them may compromise SLO or deadline satisfaction. Nevertheless, existing interference prediction approaches remain limited in several respects, which may restrict their usefulness for scheduling. First, they are often coarse-grained, which ignores runtime co-location dynamics and thus restricts their accuracy in interference prediction. Second, they tend to use a static prediction model, which may not effectively cope with different workload characteristics. To this end, we evaluate the potential limitations of existing interference prediction approaches and outline our ongoing work toward achieving efficient ML inference scheduling."}

A fundamental challenge in observational data is that while we need to infer outcome differences under alternative treatments, we can only observe each individual's outcome under a single treatment. Existing approaches address this limitation either by training with inferred pseudo-outcomes or by creating matched instance pairs. However, recent work has largely overlooked the potential impact of post-treatment variables on the outcome. This oversight prevents existing methods from fully capturing outcome variability, resulting in increased variance in counterfactual predictions. This paper introduces Pseudo-outcome Imputation with Post-treatment Variables for Counterfactual Regression (PIPCFR), a novel approach that incorporates post-treatment variables to improve pseudo-outcome imputation. We analyze the challenges inherent in utilizing post-treatment variables and establish a novel theoretical bound for ITE risk that explicitly connects post-treatment variables to ITE estimation accuracy. Unlike existing methods that ignore these variables or impose restrictive assumptions, PIPCFR learns effective representations that preserve informative components while mitigating bias. Empirical evaluations on both real-world and simulated datasets demonstrate that PIPCFR achieves significantly lower ITE errors compared to existing methods."}

To address this trade-off, we propose \\textbf{Memorize-and-Generate (MAG)}, a framework that decouples memory compression and frame generation into distinct tasks.

Specifically, GDOF first employs label-informed fuzzy granulation to effectively represent various data types and develops granule density for precise density estimation. Subsequently, granule densities from individual attributes are integrated for outlier scoring by assessing attribute relevance with a limited number of labeled outliers. Experimental results on various real-world datasets show that GDOF stands out in detecting outliers in heterogeneous data with a minimal number of labeled outliers. The integration of Fuzzy Sets and Granular Computing in GDOF offers a practical framework for outlier detection in complex and diverse data types.

To meet these challenges, we propose IPCV, a training-free, information-preserving compression framework for MLLM visual encoders. IPCV enables aggressive token pruning inside the ViT via Neighbor-Guided Reconstruction (NGR) that temporarily reconstructs pruned tokens to participate in attention with minimal overhead, then fully restores them before passing to the LLM. Besides, we introduce Attention Stabilization (AS) to further alleviate the negative influence from token pruning by approximating the K/V of pruned tokens. It can be directly applied to previous LLM-side token pruning methods to enhance their performance.

This structure increases training expense and limits the physical interpretability of the stochastic perturbations. We introduce Stochastic Decomposition Layers (SDL) for converting deterministic machine learning weather models into probabilistic ensemble systems. Adapted from StyleGAN's hierarchical noise injection, SDL applies learned perturbations at three decoder scales through latent-driven modulation, per-pixel noise, and channel scaling. When applied to WXFormer via transfer learning, SDL requires less than 2\\% of the computational cost needed to train the baseline model. Each ensemble member is generated from a compact latent tensor (5 MB), enabling perfect reproducibility and post-inference spread adjustment through latent rescaling. Evaluation on 2022 ERA5 reanalysis shows ensembles with spread-skill ratios approaching unity and rank histograms that progressively flatten toward uniformity through medium-range forecasts, achieving calibration competitive with operational IFS-ENS.

The designed approach finds no structural model error, and it is derivative free, training free and highly parallizable. Experimental results show that the designed algorithm performs well given highly nonlinear dynamics in (mildly) high dimension up to 40 or above under a chaotic environment. It also shows better performance than classical methods such as the ensemble Kalman filter and the Particle filter in numerous tests given different level of nonlinearity. Future work will focus on extending the proposed approach to practical meteorological applications and establishing a rigorous convergence analysis."}

While existing methods often rely on additional genre labels to further improve dance generation, such labels are typically noisy, coarse, unavailable, or insufficient to capture the diversity of real-world music, which can result in rhythm misalignment or stylistic drift. In contrast, we observe that tempo, a core property reflecting musical rhythm and pace, remains relatively consistent across datasets and genres, typically ranging from 60 to 200 BPM. Based on this finding, we propose TempoMoE, a hierarchical tempo-aware Mixture-of-Experts module that enhances the diffusion model and its rhythm perception. TempoMoE organizes motion experts into tempo-structured groups for different tempo ranges, with multi-scale beat experts capturing fine- and long-range rhythmic dynamics. A Hierarchical Rhythm-Adaptive Routing dynamically selects and fuses experts from music features, enabling flexible, rhythm-aligned generation without manual genre labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TempoMoE achieves state-of-the-art results in dance quality and rhythm alignment."}

We systematically investigate the interplay between quantization precision (FP16, INT8, INT4) and replay buffer strategies in large language models, revealing unexpected dynamics. While FP16 achieves superior initial task performance (74.44% on NLU), we observe a striking inversion on subsequent tasks: quantized models outperform FP16 by 8-15% on final task forward accuracy, with INT4 achieving nearly double FP16's performance on Code generation (40% vs 20%). Critically, even minimal replay buffers (0.1%) dramatically improve retention - increasing NLU retention after Math training from 45% to 65% across all precision levels - with INT8 consistently achieving the optimal balance between learning plasticity and knowledge retention. We hypothesize that quantization-induced noise acts as implicit regularization, preventing the overfitting to new task gradients that plagues high-precision models. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom that higher precision is always preferable, suggesting instead that INT8 quantization offers both computational efficiency and superior continual learning dynamics. Our results provide practical guidelines for deploying compressed models in continual learning scenarios: small replay buffers (1-2%) suffice for NLU tasks, while Math and Code benefit from moderate buffers (5-10%), with quantized models requiring less replay than FP16 to achieve comparable retention.

Second, generation exhibits an SAD (Subdominant Accumulation to Dominant) pattern, where hallucinated tokens arise from the repeated accumulation of subdominant tokens lacking support from attention (visual perception) or feed-forward network (internal knowledge).

This limitation stems from the intrinsic constraints of pixel-only training objectives, which inherently bias models toward appearance fidelity at the expense of learning underlying kinematic principles. To address this, we introduce EchoMotion, a framework designed to model the joint distribution of appearance and human motion, thereby improving the quality of complex human action video generation. EchoMotion extends the DiT (Diffusion Transformer) framework with a dual-branch architecture that jointly processes tokens concatenated from different modalities. Furthermore, we propose MVS-RoPE (Motion-Video Syncronized RoPE), which offers unified 3D positional encoding for both video and motion tokens. By providing a synchronized coordinate system for the dual-modal latent sequence, MVS-RoPE establishes an inductive bias that fosters temporal alignment between the two modalities. We also propose a Motion-Video Two-Stage Training Strategy. This strategy enables the model to perform both the joint generation of complex human action videos and their corresponding motion sequences, as well as versatile cross-modal conditional generation tasks. To facilitate the training of a model with these capabilities, we construct HuMoVe, a large-scale dataset of approximately 80,000 high-quality, human-centric video-motion pairs. Our findings reveal that explicitly representing human motion is complementary to appearance, significantly boosting the coherence and plausibility of human-centric video generation."}

To interpret the neural mechanism underlying thoughts, we propose a transformers-based framework to extract spatial-temporal representations associated with observed visual stimuli from EEG recordings. These features are subsequently incorporated into the attention mechanisms of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) to facilitate the reconstruction of visual stimuli from brain activity. The quantitative evaluations on publicly available benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method excels at modeling the semantic structures from EEG signals; achieving up to 6.5% increase in latent space clustering accuracy and 11.8% increase in zero shot generalization across unseen classes while having comparable Inception Score and Fréchet Inception Distance with existing baselines.

We overcome these limitations by proposing an online DR-RL algorithm with general function approximation that learns an optimal robust policy purely through interaction with the environment, without requiring prior models or offline data, enabling deployment in high-dimensional tasks. We further provide a theoretical analysis establishing a near-optimal sublinear regret bound under a total variation uncertainty set, demonstrating the sample efficiency and effectiveness of our method."}

We introduce a direct, first-principles framework for constructing discrete-time SSMs that is both flexible and modular. Our approach is based on a novel lag operator, which geometrically derives the discrete-time recurrence by measuring how the system's basis functions \"slide\" and change from one timestep to the next. The resulting state matrices are computed via a single inner product involving this operator, offering a modular design space for creating novel SSMs by flexibly combining different basis functions and time-warping schemes. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that a specific instance exactly recovers the recurrence of the influential HiPPO model. Numerical simulations confirm our derivation, providing new theoretical tools for designing flexible and robust sequence models."}

This application enables the quantification of the differential contributions of key scene elements to the model prediction. We identify relevant decision factors via a multi-criterion selection mechanism that considers both image similarity for minimal perturbations and decision confidence to prioritize impactful changes. This approach evaluates and compares diverse explanations, and assesses the interdependency and mutual influence among explanatory properties. By leveraging image-specific concepts, DeX generates image-grounded, sparse explanations, yielding significant improvements over the state of the art.

Crash video analysis is a challenging multitask problem due to the complex spatiotemporal dynamics of crash events in video data and the diverse analytical requirements involved. It requires capabilities spanning crash recognition, temporal grounding, and high-level video understanding. Existing models, however, cannot perform all these tasks within a unified framework, and effective training strategies for such models remain underexplored. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes CrashChat, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) for multitask traffic crash analysis, built upon VideoLLaMA3. CrashChat acquires domain-specific knowledge through instruction fine-tuning and employs a novel multitask learning strategy based on task decoupling and grouping, which maximizes the benefit of joint learning within and across task groups while mitigating negative transfer. Numerical experiments on consolidated public datasets demonstrate that CrashChat consistently outperforms existing MLLMs across model scales and traditional vision-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It reaches near-perfect accuracy in crash recognition, a 176\\% improvement in crash localization, and a 40\\% improvement in the more challenging pre-crash localization. Compared to general MLLMs, it substantially enhances textual accuracy and content coverage in crash description and reasoning tasks, with 0.18-0.41 increases in BLEU scores and 0.18-0.42 increases in ROUGE scores.

Most existing methods use Gaussian processes (GP) as the surrogate model for approximating the black-box objective function, it is well-known that it can fail in high-dimensional space (e.g., dimension over 500). We argue that the reliance of GP on precise numerical fitting is fundamentally ill-suited in high-dimensional space, where it leads to prohibitive computational complexity. In order to address this, we propose a simple order-preserving Bayesian optimization (OPBO) method, where the surrogate model preserves the order, instead of the value, of the black-box objective function. Then we can use a simple but effective OP neural network (NN) to replace GP as the surrogate model. Moreover, instead of searching for the best solution from the acquisition model, we select good-enough solutions in the ordinal set to reduce computational cost. The experimental results show that for high-dimensional (over 500) black-box optimization problems, the proposed OPBO significantly outperforms traditional BO methods based on regression NN and GP.

These are spurious cues which are associated with output labels in the training data but are unrelated to task semantics. When the shortcut features are associated with sensitive attributes, shortcut learning can lead to biased model performance. Existing methods for localising and understanding shortcut learning are mostly based upon qualitative, image-level inspection and assume cues are human-visible, limiting their use in domains such as medical imaging. We introduce OSCAR (Ordinal Scoring Correlations for Attribution Representations), a model-agnostic framework for quantifying shortcut learning and localising shortcut features. OSCAR converts image-level task attribution maps into dataset-level rank profiles of image regions and compares them across three models: a balanced baseline model (BA), a test model (TS), and a sensitive attribute predictor (SA). By computing pairwise, partial, and deviation-based correlations on these rank profiles, we produce a set of quantitative metrics that characterise the degree of shortcut reliance for TS, together with a ranking of image-level regions that contribute most to it. Experiments on CelebA, CheXpert, and ADNI show that our correlations are (i) stable across seeds and partitions, (ii) sensitive to the level of association between shortcut features and output labels in the training data, and (iii) able to distinguish localised from diffuse shortcut features. As an illustration of the utility of our method, we show how worst-group performance disparities can be reduced using a simple test-time attenuation approach based on the identified shortcut regions. OSCAR provides a lightweight, pixel-space audit that yields statistical decision rules and spatial maps, enabling users to test, localise, and mitigate shortcut reliance.

Applied to the ADNI cohort, R-GenIMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in four-way classification across normal cognition (NC), subjective memory concerns (SMC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and AD. Beyond predictive accuracy, the model yields biologically meaningful explanations by identifying stage-specific brain regions and gene signatures, as well as coherent ROI-Gene association patterns across the disease continuum. Attention-based attribution revealed genes consistently enriched for established GWAS-supported AD risk loci, including APOE, BIN1, CLU, and RBFOX1. Stage-resolved neuroanatomical signatures identified shared vulnerability hubs across disease stages alongside stage-specific patterns: striatal involvement in subjective decline, frontotemporal engagement during prodromal impairment, and consolidated multimodal network disruption in AD. These results demonstrate that interpretable multimodal AI can synthesize imaging and genetics to reveal mechanistic insights, providing a foundation for clinically deployable tools that enable earlier risk stratification and inform precision therapeutic strategies in Alzheimer's disease."}

Existing solutions for this problem are limited by either the usage of a large and rigid list of vocabularies or by the dependency on complex pipelines with fragile heuristics where errors propagate across stages. Meanwhile, the ability of recent large multi-modal models (LMMs) equipped with explicit or implicit reasoning to comprehend visual-language data, decompose problems, retrieve latent knowledge, and self-correct suggests a more principled and effective alternative. Building on these capabilities, we propose FiNDR (Fine-grained Name Discovery via Reasoning), the first reasoning-augmented LMM-based framework for vocabulary-free fine-grained recognition. The system operates in three automated steps: (i) a reasoning-enabled LMM generates descriptive candidate labels for each image; (ii) a vision-language model filters and ranks these candidates to form a coherent class set; and (iii) the verified names instantiate a lightweight multi-modal classifier used at inference time. Extensive experiments on popular fine-grained classification benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance under the vocabulary-free setting, with a significant relative margin of up to 18.8% over previous approaches. Remarkably, the proposed method surpasses zero-shot baselines that exploit pre-defined ground-truth names, challenging the assumption that human-curated vocabularies define an upper bound. Additionally, we show that carefully curated prompts enable open-source LMMs to match proprietary counterparts. These findings establish reasoning-augmented LMMs as an effective foundation for scalable, fully automated, open-world fine-grained visual recognition.

However, the high computational cost of processing dense visual tokens remains a major bottleneck. A critical component in this pipeline is the visual projector, which bridges the vision encoder and the language model. Standard designs often employ a simple multi-layer perceptron for direct token mapping, but this approach scales poorly with high-resolution inputs, introducing significant redundancy. We present Delta-LLaVA, a token-efficient projector that employs a low-rank DeltaProjection to align multi-level vision features into a compact subspace before further interaction. On top of this base alignment, lightweight Transformer blocks act as specialization layers, capturing both global and local structure under constrained token budgets. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that this base-then-specialize design yields consistent gains across multiple benchmarks with only 144 tokens, highlighting the importance of token formation prior to scaling interaction capacity. With Delta-LLaVA, inference throughput improves by up to 55%, while end-to-end training accelerates by nearly 4-5x in pretraining and over 1.5x in finetuning, highlighting the dual benefits of our design in both efficiency and scalability."}

We study the training dynamics of neural networks under DP by comparing Gradient Descent (GD), and Adam to their privacy-preserving variants. Prior work shows that these optimizers exhibit distinct stability dynamics: full-batch methods train at the Edge of Stability (EoS), while mini-batch and adaptive methods exhibit analogous edge-of-stability behavior. At these regimes, the training loss and the sharpness--the maximum eigenvalue of the training loss Hessian--exhibit certain characteristic behavior. In DP training, per-example gradient clipping and Gaussian noise modify the update rule, and it is unclear whether these stability patterns persist. We analyze how clipping and noise change sharpness and loss evolution and show that while DP generally reduces the sharpness and can prevent optimizers from fully reaching the classical stability thresholds, patterns from EoS and analogous adaptive methods stability regimes persist, with the largest learning rates and largest privacy budgets approaching, and sometimes exceeding, these thresholds. These findings highlight the unpredictability introduced by DP in neural network optimization."}

Our approach leverages an art-specific Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) on top of latent embeddings of generative image models. Trained on artistic data, our SAE learns an emergent, largely disentangled set of stylistic and compositional concepts, corresponding to style-related elements pertaining brushwork, texture, and color palette, as well as semantic and structural concepts. We call it LouvreSAE and use it to construct style profiles: compact, decomposable steering vectors that enable style transfer without any model updates or optimization. Unlike prior concept-based style transfer methods, our method requires no fine-tuning, no LoRA training, and no additional inference passes, enabling direct steering of artistic styles from only a few reference images. We validate our method on ArtBench10, achieving or surpassing existing methods on style evaluations (VGG Style Loss and CLIP Score Style) while being 1.7-20x faster and, critically, interpretable."}

In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach."}

To efficiently scale visually grounded datasets, we further develop an automatic data annotation pipeline requiring minimal human effort. We evaluate Point-VLA on diverse real-world referring tasks and observe consistently stronger performance than text-only instruction VLAs, particularly in cluttered or unseen-object scenarios, with robust generalization.

To maintain a comfortable indoor environment and minimize the contribution of the building to climate change as much as possible, higher requirements are placed on the operation and control of HVAC systems, e.g., more energy-efficient and flexible to response to the rapid change of weather. This places demands on the rapid modeling and prediction of zone air temperatures of buildings. Compared to the traditional simulation-based approach such as EnergyPlus and DOE2, a hybrid approach combined physics and data-driven is more suitable. Recently, the availability of high-quality datasets and algorithmic breakthroughs have driven a considerable amount of work in this field. However, in the niche of short- and long-term predictions, there are still some gaps in existing research. This paper aims to develop a time series forecast model to predict the zone air temperature in a building located in America on a 2-week horizon. The findings could be further improved to support intelligent control and operation of HVAC systems (i.e. demand flexibility) and could also be used as hybrid building energy modeling."}

To test this, we construct a new dataset of half-objects from three ShapeNet classes (Airplane, Car, and Chair) and train two generative models. Experiments demonstrate that the generated shapes are symmetrical and consistent, compared with the generated objects from the original model and the original dataset objects."}

It aims to infer a complete 3D volumetric representation of both semantics and geometry from a single image. Existing methods typically focus on end-to-end 2D-to-3D feature lifting and voxel completion. However, they often overlook the interference between high-confidence visible-region perception and low-confidence occluded-region reasoning caused by single-image input, which can lead to feature dilution and error propagation.\n  To address these challenges, we introduce an offline Visible Region Label Extraction (VRLE) strategy that explicitly separates and extracts voxel-level supervision for visible regions from dense 3D ground truth. This strategy purifies the supervisory space for two complementary sub-tasks: visible-region perception and occluded-region reasoning. Building on this idea, we propose the Visible-Occluded Interactive Completion Network (VOIC), a novel dual-decoder framework that explicitly decouples SSC into visible-region semantic perception and occluded-region scene completion. VOIC first constructs a base 3D voxel representation by fusing image features with depth-derived occupancy. The visible decoder focuses on generating high-fidelity geometric and semantic priors, while the occlusion decoder leverages these priors together with cross-modal interaction to perform coherent global scene reasoning.\n  Extensive experiments on the SemanticKITTI and SSCBench-KITTI360 benchmarks demonstrate that VOIC outperforms existing monocular SSC methods in both geometric completion and semantic segmentation accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}

In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based fraud detection framework that addresses the challenge of large-scale heterogeneous graph clustering through a principled link transformation approach. Our method distinguishes between \\emph{hard links} (high-confidence identity relationships such as phone numbers, credit cards, and national IDs) and \\emph{soft links} (behavioral associations including device fingerprints, cookies, and IP addresses). We introduce a graph transformation technique that first identifies connected components via hard links, merges them into super-nodes, and then reconstructs a weighted soft-link graph amenable to efficient embedding and clustering. The transformed graph is processed using LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) for representation learning, followed by HDBSCAN (Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) for density-based cluster discovery. Experiments on a real-world payment platform dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves significant graph size reduction (from 25 million to 7.7 million nodes), doubles the detection coverage compared to hard-link-only baselines, and maintains high precision across identified fraud clusters.

We propose **DVI (Disentangled Visual-Identity)**, a zero-shot framework that orthogonally disentangles identity into fine-grained semantic and coarse-grained visual streams. Unlike methods relying solely on semantic vectors, DVI exploits the inherent statistical properties of the VAE latent space, utilizing mean and variance as lightweight descriptors for global visual atmosphere. We introduce a **Parameter-Free Feature Modulation** mechanism that adaptively modulates semantic embeddings with these visual statistics, effectively injecting the reference's ``visual soul'' without training. Furthermore, a **Dynamic Temporal Granularity Scheduler** aligns with the diffusion process, prioritizing visual atmosphere in early denoising stages while refining semantic details later. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVI significantly enhances visual consistency and atmospheric fidelity without parameter fine-tuning, maintaining robust identity preservation and outperforming state-of-the-art methods in IBench evaluations."}

However, most existing applications are limited to identifying objects alone, without considering their associated states. The ability to recognize both the state and object simultaneously remains less common. One approach to address this is by treating state and object as a single category during training. However, this approach poses challenges in data collection and training since it requires comprehensive data for all possible combinations. Compositional Zero-shot Learning (CZSL) emerges as a viable solution by treating the state and object as distinct categories during training. CZSL facilitates the identification of novel compositions even in the absence of data for every conceivable combination. The current state-of-the-art method, KG-SP, addresses this issue by training distinct classifiers for states and objects, while leveraging a semantic model to evaluate the plausibility of composed compositions. However, KG-SP's accuracy in state and object recognition can be further improved, and it fails to consider the weighting of states and objects during composition. In this study, we propose SASOW, an enhancement of KG-SP that considers the weighting of states and objects while improving composition recognition accuracy. First, we introduce self-attention mechanisms into the classifiers for states and objects, leading to enhanced accuracy in recognizing both. Additionally, we incorporate the weighting of states and objects during composition to generate more reasonable and accurate compositions. Our validation process involves testing SASOW on three established benchmark datasets.

Under OAC-FL, every client modulates its intermediate parameters, such as gradient, onto the same set of orthogonal waveforms and simultaneously transmits the radio signal to the edge server. By exploiting the superposition property of multiple-access channels, the edge server can obtain an automatically aggregated global gradient from the received signal. However, the limited number of orthogonal waveforms available in practical systems is fundamentally mismatched with the high dimensionality of modern deep learning models. To address this issue, we propose Freshness Freshness-mAgnItude awaRe top-k (FAIR-k), an algorithm that selects, in each communication round, the most impactful subset of gradients to be updated over the air. In essence, FAIR-k combines the complementary strengths of the Round-Robin and Top-k algorithms, striking a delicate balance between timeliness (freshness of parameter updates) and importance (gradient magnitude). Leveraging tools from Markov analysis, we characterize the distribution of parameter staleness under FAIR-k. Building on this, we establish the convergence rate of OAC-FL with FAIR-k, which discloses the joint effect of data heterogeneity, channel noise, and parameter staleness on the training efficiency. Notably, as opposed to conventional analyses that assume a universal Lipschitz constant across all the clients, our framework adopts a finer-grained model of the data heterogeneity. The analysis demonstrates that since FAIR-k promotes fresh (and fair) parameter updates, it not only accelerates convergence but also enhances communication efficiency by enabling an extended period of local training without significantly affecting overall training efficiency."}

To this end, we introduce ICP-4D, a simple yet effective training-free framework that unifies spatial and temporal reasoning through geometric relations among instance-level point sets. Specifically, we apply the Iterative Closest Point (ICP) algorithm to directly associate temporally consistent instances by aligning the source and target point sets through the estimated transformation.

Achieving sub-minute orchestration of renewables, storage, and loads, while minimizing PUE and lifecycle carbon intensity, hinges on accurate load forecasting. However, existing methods struggle to address small-sample scenarios caused by cold start, load distortion, multi-source data fragmentation, and distribution shifts in green data centers. We introduce HyperLoad, a cross-modality framework that exploits pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to overcome data scarcity. In the Cross-Modality Knowledge Alignment phase, textual priors and time-series data are mapped to a common latent space, maximizing the utility of prior knowledge. In the Multi-Scale Feature Modeling phase, domain-aligned priors are injected through adaptive prefix-tuning, enabling rapid scenario adaptation, while an Enhanced Global Interaction Attention mechanism captures cross-device temporal dependencies. The public DCData dataset is released for benchmarking. Under both data sufficient and data scarce settings, HyperLoad consistently surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, demonstrating its practicality for sustainable green data center management."}

We introduce the Open-World Ecological Taxonomy Classification, a unified framework that captures the co-occurrence of these challenges in realistic ecological settings. To address them, we propose TaxoNet, an embedding-based encoder with a dual-margin penalization loss that strengthens learning signals from rare underrepresented taxa while mitigating the dominance of overrepresented ones, directly confronting interrelated challenges. We evaluate our method on diverse ecological domains: Google Auto-Arborist (urban trees), iNat-Plantae (Plantae observations from various ecosystems in iNaturalist-2019), and NAFlora-Mini (a curated herbarium collection). Our model consistently outperforms baselines, particularly for rare taxa, establishing a strong foundation for open-world plant taxonomic monitoring.

Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time. Results: We evaluate our CA-models on a seizure detection task both on a short-term (~20 hours) and a long-term (~2500 hours) dataset. In particular, our CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. Even in this challenging scenario, our CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76). Similarly, CA-EEGNet based on EEGNet, also surpasses its baseline in median F1-score (0.79 vs 0.74). Conclusion and significance: Our CA-model addresses two issues: first, it is channel-adaptive and can therefore be trained across heterogeneous subjects without loss of performance; second, it increases the effective temporal context size to a clinically-relevant length. Therefore, our model is a drop-in replacement for existing models, bringing better characteristics and performance across the board."}

Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively. An experiment aimed at hybrid modeling in chemical engineering was conducted by using RP-CATE and the experimental results demonstrate that RP-CATE achieves the best performance compared to other baseline models."}

Capitalizing on this strength, we propose \\textbf{SVLP-IL}, a VLP-based RF-IL framework that balances stability and plasticity via \\textit{Multi-Aspect Prompting} (MAP) and \\textit{Selective Elastic Weight Consolidation} (SEWC). MAP isolates domain dependencies, enhances distribution-shift sensitivity, and mitigates forgetting by jointly exploiting universal and domain-specific cues. SEWC selectively preserves critical weights from previous tasks, retaining essential knowledge while allowing flexibility for new adaptations.

A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

Given a reference image (e.g., one's pet), we expect the generated image to retain precise details attached to the subject's identity. However, current generative evaluation metrics emphasize the overall semantic similarity between the reference and the output, and overlook these fine-grained discriminative details. We introduce Finer-Personalization Rank, an evaluation protocol tailored to identity preservation. Instead of pairwise similarity, Finer-Personalization Rank adopts a ranking view: it treats each generated image as a query against an identity-labeled gallery consisting of visually similar real images. Retrieval metrics (e.g., mean average precision) measure performance, where higher scores indicate that identity-specific details (e.g., a distinctive head spot) are preserved. We assess identity at multiple granularities -- from fine-grained categories (e.g., bird species, car models) to individual instances (e.g., re-identification). Across CUB, Stanford Cars, and animal Re-ID benchmarks, Finer-Personalization Rank more faithfully reflects identity retention than semantic-only metrics and reveals substantial identity drift in several popular personalization methods. These results position the gallery-based protocol as a principled and practical evaluation for personalized generation."}

This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features."}

To this end, we present a Bayesian Deep Learning Framework to detect neuronal activities in 4D spatio-temporal data obtained by light sheet microscopy. Our approach accounts for the use of temporal information by calculating pixel wise correlation maps and combines it with spatial information given by the mean summary image. The Bayesian framework not only produces probability segmentation maps but also models the uncertainty pertaining to active neuron detection. To evaluate the accuracy of our framework we implemented the test of reproducibility to assert the generalization of the network to detect neuron activity. The network achieved a mean Dice Score of 0.81 relative to the synthetic Ground Truth obtained by Otsu's method and a mean Dice Score of 0.79 between the first and second run for test of reproducibility.

Preprint under review for journal submission", "summary": "Few-shot action recognition aims to enable models to quickly learn new action categories from limited labeled samples, addressing the challenge of data scarcity in real-world applications. Current research primarily addresses three core challenges: (1) temporal modeling, where models are prone to interference from irrelevant static background information and struggle to capture the essence of dynamic action features; (2) visual similarity, where categories with subtle visual differences are difficult to distinguish; and (3) the modality gap between visual-textual support prototypes and visual-only queries, which complicates alignment within a shared embedding space. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a CLIP-SPM framework, which includes three components: (1) the Hierarchical Synergistic Motion Refinement (HSMR) module, which aligns deep and shallow motion features to improve temporal modeling by reducing static background interference; (2) the Semantic Prototype Modulation (SPM) strategy, which generates query-relevant text prompts to bridge the modality gap and integrates them with visual features, enhancing the discriminability between similar actions; and (3) the Prototype-Anchor Dual Modulation (PADM) method, which refines support prototypes and aligns query features with a global semantic anchor, improving consistency across support and query samples. Comprehensive experiments across standard benchmarks, including Kinetics, SSv2-Full, SSv2-Small, UCF101, and HMDB51, demonstrate that our CLIP-SPM achieves competitive performance under 1-shot, 3-shot, and 5-shot settings.

To address these issues, we propose Decoupled Generative Modeling for Human-Object Interaction Synthesis (DecHOI), which separates path planning and action synthesis. A trajectory generator first produces human and object trajectories without prescribed waypoints, and an action generator conditions on these paths to synthesize detailed motions. To further improve contact realism, we employ adversarial training with a discriminator that focuses on the dynamics of distal joints. The framework also models a moving counterpart and supports responsive, long-sequence planning in dynamic scenes, while preserving plan consistency.

Fixed-precision quantization struggles to handle outlier channels in the key cache, while current mixed-precision strategies fail to accurately identify components requiring high-precision representation.

This raises a basic question: is there a general, modality-agnostic way to quantify how acquisition itself preserves or destroys the information that downstream learners could use? Here we propose an acquisition-level scalar $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ based on instrument-resolved phase space. Unlike pixelwise distortion or purely spectral errors that often saturate under aggressive undersampling, $ΔS_{\\mathcal B}$ directly quantifies how acquisition mixes or removes joint space--frequency structure at the instrument scale. We show theoretically that \\(ΔS_{\\mathcal B}\\) correctly identifies the phase-space coherence of periodic sampling as the physical source of aliasing, recovering classical sampling-theorem consequences. Empirically, across masked image classification, accelerated MRI, and massive MIMO (including over-the-air measurements), $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ consistently ranks sampling geometries and predicts downstream reconstruction/recognition difficulty \\emph{without training}. In particular, minimizing $|ΔS_{\\mathcal B}|$ enables zero-training selection of variable-density MRI mask parameters that matches designs tuned by conventional pre-reconstruction criteria.

However, despite significant progress, LVLMs still suffer from severe hallucination issues in object recognition tasks. These models often fail to accurately identify certain objects, leading to text generation that appears fluent but does not correspond to the visual content, which can have serious consequences in real-world applications. Recently, several methods have been proposed to alleviate LVLM hallucinations, but most focus solely on reducing hallucinations in the language modality. To mitigate hallucinations in both the language and visual modalities, we introduce Hallucination Disentangled Decoding (HDD) method that requires no training. HDD enhances the original image by segmenting it and selecting images that augment the original, while also utilizing a blank image to eliminate language prior hallucinations in both the original and segmented images. This design not only reduces the model's dependence on language priors but also enhances its visual performance. (Code: https://github.com/rickeyhhh/Hallucination-Disentangled-Decoding)"}

Nevertheless, traditional GAN fail to account for the mapping relationship between labels and features, which limits further performance improvement. Although some studies have proposed solutions, none have considered both performance and efficiency simultaneously. To address these problems, this paper proposes the multi-task learning-based regression GAN framework that integrates regression information into both the discriminator and generator, and implements a shallow sharing mechanism between the discriminator and regressor. This approach significantly enhances the quality of generated samples while improving the algorithm's operational efficiency. Moreover, considering the importance of training samples and generated samples, a dual data evaluation strategy is designed to make GAN generate more diverse samples, thereby increasing the generalization of subsequent modeling. The superiority of method is validated through four classic industrial soft sensing cases: wastewater treatment plants, surface water, $CO_2$ absorption towers, and industrial gas turbines."}

Although recent methods demonstrate strong performance, they depend heavily on SAM and CLIP to generate and classify 3D instance masks from images accompanying the point cloud, leading to substantial computational overhead and slow processing that limit their deployment in real-world settings. Open-YOLO 3D alleviates this issue by using a real-time 2D detector to classify class-agnostic masks produced directly from the point cloud by a pretrained 3D segmenter, eliminating the need for SAM and CLIP and significantly reducing inference time.

Second, we introduce two new unlearning strategies tailored to hybrid models. Experiments across Iris, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, under both subset removal and full-class deletion, reveal that quantum models can support effective unlearning, but outcomes depend strongly on circuit depth, entanglement structure, and task complexity.

Our analysis reveals that the representation space of MLLMs is overwhelmingly dominated by textual semantics; the visual information essential for multimodal retrieval only constitutes a small portion. This imbalance is compounded by the heavy focus of MLLMs on bridging image-text modalities, which facilitates generation but homogenizes embeddings and finally diminishes the discriminative power required for multimodal retrieval. We further discover that the specific feature components that contribute most to the similarity computations for MLLMs are in fact distractors that actively degrade retrieval performance. Overall, our work provides the first in-depth interpretability analysis of MLLM representations in the context of multimodal retrieval and offers possible directions for enhancing the multimodal retrieval capabilities of MLLMs."}

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC).

A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability.

However, most existing methods still rely on replaying data from previous stages to prevent catastrophic forgetting, which compromises privacy and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where data transfer across sites is often restricted. In this work, we propose InvCoSS, an inversion-driven continual self-supervised learning framework for medical multi-modal image pre-training. Specifically, after training on a previous task, InvCoSS inverts the pre-trained self-supervised model to generate synthetic images that approximate the original training distribution. These synthetic images are then combined with data from the new task for joint optimization, which effectively mitigates catastrophic forgetting while strictly adhering to the constraint of no access to previous real data. Furthermore, to improve the fidelity of synthetic images, we introduce a novel InvUNet with a multi-scale fusion architecture to restore both high- and low-frequency components of the inverted images. To enhance diversity and prevent mode collapse, we design a repulsive representation-learning mechanism that encourages a diverse feature space for synthetic images without class guidance. Extensive experiments across nine downstream tasks validate the effectiveness of InvCoSS, achieving performance comparable to or even superior to prior data-replay methods while significantly reducing storage requirements and eliminating data privacy constraints."}

To address this, we propose HippMetric, a skeletal representation (s-rep)-based framework for hippocampal substructural morphometry and point-wise correspondence across individuals and scans. HippMetric builds on the Axis-Referenced Morphometric Model (ARMM) and employs a deformable skeletal coordinate system aligned with hippocampal anatomy and function, providing a biologically grounded reference for correspondence. Our framework comprises two core modules: a skeletal-based coordinate system that respects the hippocampus' conserved longitudinal lamellar architecture, in which functional units (lamellae) are stacked perpendicular to the long-axis, enabling anatomically consistent localization across subjects and time; and individualized s-reps generated through surface reconstruction, deformation, and geometrically constrained spoke refinement, enforcing boundary adherence, orthogonality and non-intersection to produce mathematically valid skeletal geometry.

Our approach directly realizes Sprecher's specific 1965 sum of shifted splines formula in its single-layer variant and extends it to deeper, multi-layer compositions. We further enhance the architecture with optional lateral mixing connections that enable intra-block communication between output dimensions, providing a parameter-efficient alternative to full attention mechanisms. Beyond parameter efficiency with $O(LN + LG)$ scaling (where $G$ is the knot count of the shared splines) versus MLPs' $O(LN^2)$, SNs admit a sequential evaluation strategy that reduces peak forward-intermediate memory from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ (treating batch size as constant), making much wider architectures feasible under memory constraints.

The dataset exhibits realistic challenges including cross-modal inconsistency and long-tailed class distributions shaped by Indonesian cultural communication norms.

In the second stage, compact scene-level embeddings are learned through a heterogeneous graph autoencoder (GraphMAE).

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior."}

In physics, conservation laws of Hamiltonian systems such as symplecticity guarantee long-term stability, and recent work has begun to hard-wire such constraints into learning models at the loss or output level. Here we ask a different question: what would it mean for the representation itself to obey a symplectic conservation law in the sense of Hamiltonian mechanics?\n  We express this symplectic constraint through Legendre duality: the pairing between primal and dual parameters, which becomes the structure that the representation must preserve. We formalize Legendre dynamics as stochastic processes whose trajectories remain on Legendre graphs, so that the evolving primal-dual parameters stay Legendre dual. We show that this class includes linear time-invariant Gaussian process regression and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics.\n  Geometrically, we prove that the maps that preserve all Legendre graphs are exactly symplectomorphisms of cotangent bundles of the form \"cotangent lift of a base diffeomorphism followed by an exact fibre translation\". Dynamically, this characterization leads to the design of a Symplectic Reservoir (SR), a reservoir-computing architecture that is a special case of recurrent neural network and whose recurrent core is generated by Hamiltonian systems that are at most linear in the momentum.\n  Our main theorem shows that every SR update has this normal form and therefore transports Legendre graphs to Legendre graphs, preserving Legendre duality at each time step. Overall, SR implements a geometrically constrained, Legendre-preserving representation map, injecting symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian mechanics directly at the representational level."}

However, generating truly realistic human animation remains a formidable challenge, where even minor inconsistencies can make a subject appear unnatural. This limitation is particularly critical when AI-generated videos are evaluated for behavioral biometrics, where subtle motion cues that define identity are easily lost or distorted. The present study investigates whether state-of-the-art GenAI human animation models can preserve the subtle spatio-temporal details needed for person identification through gait biometrics. Specifically, we evaluate four different GenAI models across two primary evaluation tasks to assess their ability to i) restore gait patterns from reference videos under varying conditions of complexity, and ii) transfer these gait patterns to different visual identities. Our results show that while visual quality is mostly high, biometric fidelity remains low in tasks focusing on identification, suggesting that current GenAI models struggle to disentangle identity from motion. Furthermore, through an identity transfer task, we expose a fundamental flaw in appearance-based gait recognition: when texture is disentangled from motion, identification collapses, proving current GenAI models rely on visual attributes rather than temporal dynamics."}

We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems."}

We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.\n  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.\n  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning."}

To address these limitations, we propose Reinforcement Mixing Learning (RMLer), a framework that formulates cross-category concept fusion as a reinforcement learning problem: mixed features serve as states, mixing strategies as actions, and visual outcomes as rewards. Specifically, we design an MLP-policy network to predict dynamic coefficients for blending cross-category text embeddings. We further introduce visual rewards based on (1) semantic similarity and (2) compositional balance between the fused object and its constituent concepts, optimizing the policy via proximal policy optimization. At inference, a selection strategy leverages these rewards to curate the highest-quality fused objects.

In this work, we introduce an inverse scattering inspired Fourier Neural Operator(IS-FNO), motivated by the reversibility and spectral evolution structure underlying the classical inverse scattering transform. The proposed architecture enforces a near-reversible pairing between lifting and projection maps through an explicitly invertible neural transformation, and models latent temporal evolution using exponential Fourier layers that naturally encode linear and nonlinear spectral dynamics. We systematically evaluate IS-FNO against baseline FNO and Koopman-based models on a range of benchmark PDEs, including the Michelson-Sivashinsky and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations (in one and two dimensions), as well as the integrable Korteweg-de Vries and Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations. The results demonstrate that IS-FNO achieves lower short-term errors and substantially improved long-horizon stability in non-stiff regimes. For integrable systems, reduced IS-FNO variants that embed analytical scattering structure retain competitive long-term accuracy despite limited model capacity.

Unlike other kernel methods such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs), KLRs are generally not sparse. Previous attempts to deal with sparsity in KLR include a heuristic method referred to as the Import Vector Machine (IVM) and ad hoc regularizations such as the $\\ell_{1/2}$-based one. Achieving a good trade-off between prediction accuracy and sparsity is still a challenging issue with a potential significant impact from the application point of view. In this work, we revisit binary KLR and propose an extension of the training formulation proposed by Keerthi et al., which is able to induce sparsity in the trained model, while maintaining good testing accuracy. To efficiently solve the dual of this formulation, we devise a decomposition algorithm of Sequential Minimal Optimization type which exploits second-order information, and for which we establish global convergence. Numerical experiments conducted on 12 datasets from the literature show that the proposed binary KLR approach achieves a competitive trade-off between accuracy and sparsity with respect to IVM, $\\ell_{1/2}$-based regularization for KLR, and SVM while retaining the advantages of providing informative estimates of the class membership probabilities."}

During training, the input of a prediction network at one training timestep is the corresponding ground-truth noisy data that is an interpolation of the noise and the data, and during testing, the input is the generated noisy data. We present a novel training approach, named MixFlow, for improving the performance. Our approach is motivated by the Slow Flow phenomenon: the ground-truth interpolation that is the nearest to the generated noisy data at a given sampling timestep is observed to correspond to a higher-noise timestep (termed slowed timestep), i.e., the corresponding ground-truth timestep is slower than the sampling timestep. MixFlow leverages the interpolations at the slowed timesteps, named slowed interpolation mixture, for post-training the prediction network for each training timestep. Experiments over class-conditional image generation (including SiT, REPA, and RAE) and text-to-image generation validate the effectiveness of our approach. Our approach MixFlow over the RAE models achieve strong generation results on ImageNet: 1.43 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 256 x 256, and 1.55 FID (without guidance) and 1.10 (with guidance) at 512 x 512."}

On the other hand, post-hoc methods, which evaluate pre-trained models, focus on solving problems related to improving the confidence in the model's predictions, and detecting Out-Of-Distribution or Adversarial Attacks samples as independent applications. To tackle the limited applicability of already existing methods, we introduce Multi-Layer Analysis for Confidence Scoring (MACS), a unified post-hoc framework that analyzes intermediate activations to produce classification-maps. From the classification-maps, we derive a score applicable for confidence estimation, detecting distributional shifts and adversarial attacks, unifying the three problems in a common framework, and achieving performances that surpass the state-of-the-art approaches in our experiments with the VGG16 and ViTb16 models with a fraction of their computational overhead."}

While neural implicit functions have previously been applied to this task, their application to mapping anatomical consistency across subjects has been limited. In this work, we introduce Neural Implicit Heart Coordinates (NIHCs), a standardized implicit coordinate system, based on universal ventricular coordinates, that provides a common anatomical reference frame for the human heart. Our method predicts NIHCs directly from a limited number of 2D segmentations (sparse acquisition) and subsequently decodes them into dense 3D segmentations and high-resolution meshes at arbitrary output resolution. Trained on a large dataset of 5,000 cardiac meshes, the model achieves high reconstruction accuracy on clinical contours, with mean Euclidean surface errors of 2.51$\\pm$0.33 mm in a diseased cohort (n=4549) and 2.3$\\pm$0.36 mm in a healthy cohort (n=5576). The NIHC representation enables anatomically coherent reconstruction even under severe slice sparsity and segmentation noise, faithfully recovering complex structures such as the valve planes. Compared with traditional pipelines, inference time is reduced from over 60 s to 5-15 s. These results demonstrate that NIHCs constitute a robust and efficient anatomical representation for patient-specific 3D cardiac reconstruction from minimal input data."}

Conventional deep learning IDS are often too large and computationally intensive for edge deployment. We propose a lightweight IDS that combines SHAP-guided feature pruning with knowledge-distilled Kronecker networks. A high-capacity teacher model identifies the most relevant features through SHAP explanations, and a compressed student leverages Kronecker-structured layers to minimize parameters while preserving discriminative inputs. Knowledge distillation transfers softened decision boundaries from teacher to student, improving generalization under compression. Experiments on the TON\\_IoT dataset show that the student is nearly three orders of magnitude smaller than the teacher yet sustains macro-F1 above 0.986 with millisecond-level inference latency. The results demonstrate that explainability-driven pruning and structured compression can jointly enable scalable, low-latency, and energy-efficient IDS for heterogeneous IoT environments."}

For this to be possible, annotated video data of table tennis is needed. We extend the public OpenTTGames dataset with highly detailed, frame-accurate shot type annotations (forehand, backhand with subtypes), player posture labels (body lean and leg stance), and rally outcome tags at point end. OpenTTGames is a set of recordings from the side of the table with official labels for bounces, when the ball is above the net, or hitting the net. The dataset already contains ball coordinates near events, which are either \"bounce\", \"net\", or \"empty_event\" in the original OpenTTGames dataset, and semantic masks (humans, table, scoreboard). Our extension adds the types of stroke to the events and a per-player taxonomy so models can move beyond event spotting toward tactical understanding (e.g., whether a stroke is likely to win the point or set up an advantage). We provide a compact coding scheme and code-assisted labeling procedure to support reproducible annotations and baselines for fine-grained stroke understanding in racket sports.

Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too."}

However, the scale and heterogeneity of WSIs generate highly redundant and dispersed information, making it difficult to identify and integrate discriminative signals. Existing MIL methods either fail to discard uninformative cues effectively or have limited ability to consolidate relevant features from multiple patches, which restricts their performance on large and heterogeneous WSIs. To address this issue, we propose DeltaMIL, a novel MIL framework that explicitly selects semantically relevant regions and integrates the discriminative information from WSIs. Our method leverages the gated delta rule to efficiently filter and integrate information through a block combining forgetting and memory mechanisms. The delta mechanism dynamically updates the memory by removing old values and inserting new ones according to their correlation with the current patch. The gating mechanism further enables rapid forgetting of irrelevant signals. Additionally, DeltaMIL integrates a complementary local pattern mixing mechanism to retain fine-grained pathological locality. Our design enhances the extraction of meaningful cues and suppresses redundant or noisy information, which improves the model's robustness and discriminative power. Experiments demonstrate that DeltaMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, for survival prediction, DeltaMIL improves performance by 3.69\\% using ResNet-50 features and 2.36\\% using UNI features. For slide-level classification, it increases accuracy by 3.09\\% with ResNet-50 features and 3.75\\% with UNI features.

For both tasks, training is performed with a batch size of 8 using two separate AdamW optimizers for the generator and discriminator, each equipped with a warmup and cosine decay scheduler, with learning rates of $5\\times10^{-4}$ and $1\\times10^{-3}$, respectively. Data preprocessing includes deformable registration, foreground cropping, percentile normalization for the input modality, and linear normalization of the CT to the range $[-1024, 1000]$.

To date, long-term and accurate MJO prediction has remained a challenge for researchers. Conventional MJO prediction methods using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) are resource-intensive, time-consuming, and highly unstable (most NWP methods are sensitive to seasons, with better MJO forecast results in winter). While existing Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methods save resources and speed forecasting, their accuracy never reaches the 28 days predicted by the state-of-the-art NWP method, i.e., the operational forecasts from ECMWF, since neural networks cannot handle climate data effectively. In this paper, we present a Domain Knowledge Embedded Spatio-Temporal Network (DK-STN), a stable neural network model for accurate and efficient MJO forecasting. It combines the benefits of NWP and ANN methods and successfully improves the forecast accuracy of ANN methods while maintaining a high level of efficiency and stability. We begin with a spatial-temporal network (STN) and embed domain knowledge in it using two key methods: (i) applying a domain knowledge enhancement method and (ii) integrating a domain knowledge processing method into network training. We evaluated DK-STN with the 5th generation of ECMWF reanalysis (ERA5) data and compared it with ECMWF. Given 7 days of climate data as input, DK-STN can generate reliable forecasts for the following 28 days in 1-2 seconds, with an error of only 2-3 days in different seasons. DK-STN significantly exceeds ECMWF in that its forecast accuracy is equivalent to ECMWF's, while its efficiency and stability are significantly superior."}

Its core objective is to identify changes within change regions of interest (CRoI). Current multimodal large models encode rich human semantic knowledge, which is utilized for guidance in tasks such as remote sensing change detection. However, existing methods that use semantic guidance for detecting users' CRoI overly rely on explicit textual descriptions of CRoI, leading to the problem of near-complete performance failure when presented with implicit CRoI textual descriptions. This paper proposes a multimodal reasoning change detection model named ReasonCD, capable of mining users' implicit task intent. The model leverages the powerful reasoning capabilities of pre-trained large language models to mine users' implicit task intents and subsequently obtains different change detection results based on these intents. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that the model achieves excellent change detection performance, with an F1 score of 92.1\\% on the BCDD dataset.

Kernel methods using the partial covariance operator offer a more principled approach but suffer from limited adaptivity, slow convergence, and poor scalability. In this work, we explore whether representation learning can help address these limitations. Specifically, we focus on representations derived from the singular value decomposition of the partial covariance operator and use them to construct a simple test statistic, reminiscent of the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC). We also introduce a practical bi-level contrastive algorithm to learn these representations. Our theory links representation learning error to test performance and establishes asymptotic validity and power guarantees. Preliminary experiments suggest that this approach offers a practical and statistically grounded path toward scalable CI testing, bridging kernel-based theory with modern representation learning."}

However, ANNs rely on dense computation, which results in high power consumption. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs), which benefit from spike-driven computation, inherently provide low power consumption. Regrettably, the potential of SNNs for DVGL has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of spike-driven computation for representation learning scenarios also results in loss of critical information and difficulties in learning long-range dependencies when aligning heterogeneous visual data sources. To address these, we propose SpikeViMFormer, the first SNN framework designed for DVGL. In this framework, a lightweight spike-driven transformer backbone is adopted to extract coarse-grained features. To mitigate the loss of critical information, the spike-driven selective attention (SSA) block is designed, which uses a spike-driven gating mechanism to achieve selective feature enhancement and highlight discriminative regions. Furthermore, a spike-driven hybrid state space (SHS) block is introduced to learn long-range dependencies using a hybrid state space. Moreover, only the backbone is utilized during the inference stage to reduce computational cost. To ensure backbone effectiveness, a novel hierarchical re-ranking alignment learning (HRAL) strategy is proposed. It refines features via neighborhood re-ranking and maintains cross-batch consistency to directly optimize the backbone.

Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments."}

However, developing effective and efficient Test-Time Scaling (TTS) methods to unlock their full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose dMLLM-TTS, a novel framework operating on two complementary scaling axes: (1) trajectory exploration scaling to enhance the diversity of generated hypotheses, and (2) iterative refinement scaling for stable generation. Conventional TTS approaches typically perform linear search across these two dimensions, incurring substantial computational costs of O(NT) and requiring an external verifier for best-of-N selection. To overcome these limitations, we propose two innovations. First, we design an efficient hierarchical search algorithm with O(N+T) complexity that adaptively expands and prunes sampling trajectories. Second, we introduce a self-verified feedback mechanism that leverages the dMLLMs' intrinsic image understanding capabilities to assess text-image alignment, eliminating the need for external verifier. Extensive experiments on the GenEval benchmark across three representative dMLLMs (e.g., Lumina-DiMOO, MMaDA, Muddit) show that our framework substantially improves generation quality while achieving up to 6x greater efficiency than linear search.

This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization."}

We propose an online algorithm for ordinal regression using directional feedback. The proposed algorithm uses an exploration-exploitation scheme to learn from directional feedback efficiently.

While token pruning offers a path to acceleration, we find that current methods, while adequate for general understanding, catastrophically fail on fine-grained localization tasks. We attribute this failure to the inherent flaws of the two prevailing strategies: importance-based methods suffer from a strong positional bias, an inherent model artifact that distracts from semantic content, while diversity-based methods exhibit structural blindness, disregarding the user's prompt and spatial redundancy. To address this, we introduce D2Pruner, a framework that rectifies these issues by uniquely combining debiased importance with a structural pruning mechanism. Our method first secures a core set of the most critical tokens as pivots based on a debiased attention score. It then performs a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) selection on the remaining tokens, which are modeled on a hybrid graph where edges signify spatial proximity and semantic similarity. This process iteratively preserves the most important and available token while removing its neighbors, ensuring that the supplementary tokens are chosen to maximize importance and diversity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D2Pruner has exceptional efficiency and fidelity. Applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B for general understanding tasks, it reduces FLOPs by 74.2\\% while retaining 99.2\\% of its original performance.

We present CARE (Contrastive Anchored REflection), a failure-centric post-training framework for multimodal reasoning that turns errors into supervision. CARE combines: (i) an anchored-contrastive objective that forms a compact subgroup around the best rollout and a set of semantically proximate hard negatives, performs within-subgroup z-score normalization with negative-only scaling, and includes an all-negative rescue to prevent zero-signal batches; and (ii) Reflection-Guided Resampling (RGR), a one-shot structured self-repair that rewrites a representative failure and re-scores it with the same verifier, converting near-misses into usable positives without any test-time reflection. CARE improves accuracy and training smoothness while explicitly increasing the share of learning signal that comes from failures. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B, CARE lifts macro-averaged accuracy by 4.6 points over GRPO across six verifiable visual-reasoning benchmarks; with Qwen3-VL-8B it reaches competitive or state-of-the-art results on MathVista and MMMU-Pro under an identical evaluation protocol."}

Owing to the importance of emotion in advertising, emotion-oriented image generation has attracted increasing attention. However, current emotion-oriented methods suffer from an affective shortcut, where emotions are approximated to semantics. As evidenced by two decades of research, emotion is not equivalent to semantics. To this end, we propose Emotion-Director, a cross-modal collaboration framework consisting of two modules. First, we propose a cross-Modal Collaborative diffusion model, abbreviated as MC-Diffusion. MC-Diffusion integrates visual prompts with textual prompts for guidance, enabling the generation of emotion-oriented images beyond semantics. Further, we improve the DPO optimization by a negative visual prompt, enhancing the model's sensitivity to different emotions under the same semantics. Second, we propose MC-Agent, a cross-Modal Collaborative Agent system that rewrites textual prompts to express the intended emotions. To avoid template-like rewrites, MC-Agent employs multi-agents to simulate human subjectivity toward emotions, and adopts a chain-of-concept workflow that improves the visual expressiveness of the rewritten prompts. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of Emotion-Director in emotion-oriented image generation."}

Neural operator (NO) surrogates offer fast inference across parametric and functional inputs; however, most autoregressive NO frameworks remain vulnerable to compounding errors, and ensemble-averaged metrics provide limited guarantees for individual inference trajectories. In practice, error accumulation can become unacceptable beyond the training horizon, and existing methods lack mechanisms for online monitoring or correction. To address this gap, we propose ANCHOR (Adaptive Numerical Correction for High-fidelity Operator Rollouts), an online, instance-aware hybrid inference framework for stable long-horizon prediction of nonlinear, time-dependent PDEs. ANCHOR treats a pretrained NO as the primary inference engine and adaptively couples it with a classical numerical solver using a physics-informed, residual-based error estimator. Inspired by adaptive time-stepping in numerical analysis, ANCHOR monitors an exponential moving average (EMA) of the normalized PDE residual to detect accumulating error and trigger corrective solver interventions without requiring access to ground-truth solutions. We show that the EMA-based estimator correlates strongly with the true relative L2 error, enabling data-free, instance-aware error control during inference. Evaluations on four canonical PDEs: 1D and 2D Burgers', 2D Allen-Cahn, and 3D heat conduction, demonstrate that ANCHOR reliably bounds long-horizon error growth, stabilizes extrapolative rollouts, and significantly improves robustness over standalone neural operators, while remaining substantially more efficient than high-fidelity numerical solvers."}

In this paper, we propose the Dynamic Stream Network (DySNet), which enables the receptive fields and weights to be dynamically adjusted. This ultimately enables the model to ignore interfering feature combinations and model the potential feature relationships.

Specifically, a geological Short Wave Infrared (SWIR) ratio sensitive to soil property changes is integrated with Thermal Infrared (TIR) data through an intermediate fusion architecture, instantiated as FusionNet. The proposed backbone embeds trainable differential signal-processing priors within convolutional layers, combines mixed pooling strategies, and employs wider receptive fields to enhance robustness across spectral modalities.\n  Systematic ablations show that each architectural component contributes to performance gains, with DGCNN achieving 88.7% accuracy on the SWIR ratio and FusionNet reaching 90.6%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across five spectral configurations. Transfer learning experiments further show that ImageNet pretraining degrades TIR performance, highlighting the importance of modality-aware training for cross-spectral learning.\n  Evaluated on real-world data, the results demonstrate that combining physics-aware feature selection with principled deep learning architectures yields robust and generalisable representations, illustrating how first-principles signal modelling can improve multi-spectral learning under challenging conditions."}

Understanding how policy evolves across layers and modules is therefore crucial for enabling more targeted optimization and raveling out complex reasoning mechanisms. In this paper, we decompose the language model policy by leveraging the intrinsic split of the Transformer residual stream and the equivalence between the composition of hidden states with the unembedding matrix and the resulting samplable policy. This decomposition reveals Internal Layer Policies, corresponding to contributions from individual layers, and Internal Modular Policies, which align with the self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN) components within each layer. By analyzing the entropy of internal policy, we find that: (a) Early layers keep high entropy for exploration, top layers converge to near-zero entropy for refinement, with convergence patterns varying across model series. (b) LLama's prediction space rapidly converges in the final layer, whereas Qwen-series models, especially Qwen3, exhibit a more human-like, progressively structured reasoning pattern. Motivated by these findings, we propose Bottom-up Policy Optimization (BuPO), a novel RL paradigm that directly optimizes the internal layer policy during early training.

Anatomy understanding tasks demand precise understanding and clinically coherent answers, which are difficult to achieve due to the complexity of medical data and the scarcity of high-quality expert annotations. These challenges limit the effectiveness of conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) strategies. While recent work has demonstrated that Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) can enhance reasoning in MLLMs without relying on large amounts of data, we find two weaknesses that hinder GRPO's reasoning performance in anatomy recognition: 1) knowledge cannot be effectively shared between different anatomical structures, resulting in uneven information gain and preventing the model from converging, and 2) the model quickly converges to a single reasoning path, suppressing the exploration of diverse strategies. To overcome these challenges, we propose two novel methods. First, we implement a progressive learning strategy called Anatomical Similarity Curriculum Learning by controlling question difficulty via the similarity of answer choices, enabling the model to master complex problems incrementally. Second, we utilize question augmentation referred to as Group Diversity Question Augmentation to expand the model's search space for difficult queries, mitigating the tendency to produce uniform responses.

To address these limitations, we propose Sigmoid-based Common and Style Supervised Contrastive Learning (SCS-SupCon). Our framework introduces a sigmoid-based pairwise contrastive loss with learnable temperature and bias parameters to enable adaptive decision boundaries. This formulation emphasizes hard negatives, mitigates negative-sample dilution, and more effectively exploits supervision.

To this end, our solution integrates three distinct input modalities (player trajectories, player types and image crops of individual players) into a unified framework that processes spatial and temporal dynamics using a cascade of sociotemporal transformer blocks. Unlike prior methods, which rely heavily on accurate ball tracking or handcrafted heuristics, our approach infers the ball trajectory without direct access to its past or future positions, and robustly identifies the ball state and ball possessor under noisy or occluded conditions from real top league matches. We also introduce CropDrop, a modality-specific masking pre-training strategy that prevents over-reliance on image features and encourages the model to rely on cross-modal patterns during pre-training. We show the effectiveness of our approach on a large-scale dataset providing substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines in all tasks. Our results highlight the benefits of combining structured and visual cues in a transformer-based architecture, and the importance of realistic masking strategies in multi-modal learning."}

The conventional approach to address this involves a two-stage pipeline: an OCR system extracts text from handwritten images, which is then translated into the target language using a machine translation model. In this work, we explore and compare the performance of traditional OCR-MT pipelines with Vision Large Language Models that aim to unify these stages and directly translate handwritten text images in a single, end-to-end step. Our motivation is grounded in the urgent need for scalable, accurate translation systems to digitize legal records such as FIRs, charge sheets, and witness statements in India's district and high courts. We evaluate both approaches on a curated dataset of handwritten Marathi legal documents, with the goal of enabling efficient legal document processing, even in low-resource environments. Our findings offer actionable insights toward building robust, edge-deployable solutions that enhance access to legal information for non-native speakers and legal professionals alike."}

Methods: We introduce NodMAISI, an anatomically constrained, nodule-oriented CT synthesis and augmentation framework trained on a unified multi-source cohort (7,042 patients, 8,841 CTs, 14,444 nodules). The framework integrates: (i) a standardized curation and annotation pipeline linking each CT with organ masks and nodule-level annotations, (ii) a ControlNet-conditioned rectified-flow generator built on MAISI-v2's foundational blocks to enforce anatomy- and lesion-consistent synthesis, and (iii) lesion-aware augmentation that perturbs nodule masks (controlled shrinkage) while preserving surrounding anatomy to generate paired CT variants. Results: Across six public test datasets, NodMAISI improved distributional fidelity relative to MAISI-v2 (real-to-synthetic FID range 1.18 to 2.99 vs 1.69 to 5.21). In lesion detectability analysis using a MONAI nodule detector, NodMAISI substantially increased average sensitivity and more closely matched clinical scans (IMD-CT: 0.69 vs 0.39; DLCS24: 0.63 vs 0.20), with the largest gains for sub-centimeter nodules where MAISI-v2 frequently failed to reproduce the conditioned lesion. In downstream nodule-level malignancy classification trained on LUNA25 and externally evaluated on LUNA16, LNDbv4, and DLCS24, NodMAISI augmentation improved AUC by 0.07 to 0.11 at <=20% clinical data and by 0.12 to 0.21 at 10%, consistently narrowing the performance gap under data scarcity."}

This allows text and image information to fully attend to one another within the model, but becomes extremely costly for high-resolution images, long conversations, or streaming videos, both in memory and compute. VLMs leveraging cross-attention are an efficient alternative to token insertion but exhibit a clear performance gap, in particular on tasks involving fine-grained visual details. We find that a key to improving such models is to also enable local text-to-text interaction in the dedicated cross-attention layers. Building on this, we propose CASA, Cross-Attention via Self-Attention, a simple and efficient paradigm which substantially reduces the gap with full token insertion on common image understanding benchmarks, while enjoying the same scalability as cross-attention models when applied to long-context multimodal tasks such as streaming video captioning.

We present FOODER, a real-time, privacy-preserving radar-based framework that integrates OOD-based facial authentication with facial expression recognition. FOODER operates using low-cost frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar and exploits both range-Doppler and micro range-Doppler representations. The authentication module employs a multi-encoder multi-decoder architecture with Body Part (BP) and Intermediate Linear Encoder-Decoder (ILED) components to classify a single enrolled individual as in-distribution while detecting all other faces as OOD. Upon successful authentication, an expression recognition module is activated. Concatenated radar representations are processed by a ResNet block to distinguish between dynamic and static facial expressions. Based on this categorization, two specialized MobileViT networks are used to classify dynamic expressions (smile, shock) and static expressions (neutral, anger). This hierarchical design enables robust facial authentication and fine-grained expression recognition while preserving user privacy by relying exclusively on radar data. Experiments conducted on a dataset collected with a 60 GHz short-range FMCW radar demonstrate that FOODER achieves an AUROC of 94.13% and an FPR95 of 18.12% for authentication, along with an average expression recognition accuracy of 94.70%. FOODER outperforms state-of-the-art OOD detection methods and several transformer-based architectures while operating efficiently in real time."}

Inspired by human memory, we propose StoryMem, a paradigm that reformulates long-form video storytelling as iterative shot synthesis conditioned on explicit visual memory, transforming pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models into multi-shot storytellers. This is achieved by a novel Memory-to-Video (M2V) design, which maintains a compact and dynamically updated memory bank of keyframes from historical generated shots. The stored memory is then injected into single-shot video diffusion models via latent concatenation and negative RoPE shifts with only LoRA fine-tuning. A semantic keyframe selection strategy, together with aesthetic preference filtering, further ensures informative and stable memory throughout generation. Moreover, the proposed framework naturally accommodates smooth shot transitions and customized story generation applications. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce ST-Bench, a diverse benchmark for multi-shot video storytelling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StoryMem achieves superior cross-shot consistency over previous methods while preserving high aesthetic quality and prompt adherence, marking a significant step toward coherent minute-long video storytelling."}

In recent years, although deep learning has advanced the field of bone age assessment, existing methods face challenges in efficiently balancing global features and local skeletal details. This study aims to develop an automated bone age assessment system based on a two-stream deep learning architecture to achieve higher accuracy in bone age assessment. We propose the BoNet+ model incorporating global and local feature extraction channels. A Transformer module is introduced into the global feature extraction channel to enhance the ability in extracting global features through multi-head self-attention mechanism. A RFAConv module is incorporated into the local feature extraction channel to generate adaptive attention maps within multiscale receptive fields, enhancing local feature extraction capabilities. Global and local features are concatenated along the channel dimension and optimized by an Inception-V3 network. The proposed method has been validated on the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) and Radiological Hand Pose Estimation (RHPE) test datasets, achieving mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 3.81 and 5.65 months, respectively. These results are comparable to the state-of-the-art. The BoNet+ model reduces the clinical workload and achieves automatic, high-precision, and more objective bone age assessment."}

Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) Phase-Aware Cross-Attention (PACA), which decomposes prompts into a global base block and temporally-anchored phase blocks, enabling the model to concentrate on phase-relevant tokens for precise temporal-semantic alignment; (2) Progressive Audio-Visual Alignment, which aligns modality influence with the hierarchical feature learning process-early layers prioritize text for establishing action structure while deeper layers emphasize audio for refining lip movements, preventing modality interference; (3) A two-stage training strategy that first establishes robust audio-visual correspondence on diverse data, then injects action control through fine-tuning on structured annotations, maintaining both audio-visual alignment and the model's text-following capabilities.

With the literature focusing on controlling the four rotors' RPMs directly, this paper aims to control the quadrotor's thrust vector. The RL agent computes the percentage of overall thrust along the quadrotor's z-axis along with the desired Roll ($φ$) and Pitch ($θ$) angles. The agent then sends the calculated control signals along with the current quadrotor's Yaw angle ($ψ$) to an attitude PID controller. The PID controller then maps the control signals to motor RPMs. The Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, a model-free off-policy stochastic RL algorithm, was used to train the RL agents. Training results show the faster training time of the proposed thrust vector controller in comparison to the conventional RPM controllers. Simulation results show smoother and more accurate path-following for the proposed thrust vector controller."}

Using normalizing flows, BabyFlow learns flexible, probabilistic representations that capture the complex, non-linear variability of expressive infant faces without restrictive linear assumptions. To address scarce and uncontrolled expressive data, we perform cross-age expression transfer, adapting expressions from adult 3D scans to enrich infant datasets with realistic and systematic expressive variants. As a result, BabyFlow improves 3D reconstruction accuracy, particularly in highly expressive regions such as the mouth, eyes, and nose, and supports synthesis and modification of infant expressions while preserving identity. Additionally, by integrating with diffusion models, BabyFlow generates high-fidelity 2D infant images with consistent 3D geometry, providing powerful tools for data augmentation and early facial analysis."}

It is then compared against training a deterministic policy and executing deterministic actions.

No Problem: Robust Vision-Tabular Learning with Missing Values", "comment": null, "summary": "Large-scale medical biobanks provide imaging data complemented by extensive tabular information, such as demographics or clinical measurements. However, this abundance of tabular attributes does not reflect real-world datasets, where only a subset of attributes may be available. This discrepancy calls for methods that can leverage all the tabular data during training while remaining robust to missing values at inference. To address this challenge, we propose RoVTL (Robust Vision-Tabular Learning), a framework designed to handle any level of tabular data availability, from 0% to 100%. RoVTL comprises two key stages: contrastive pretraining, where we introduce tabular attribute missingness as data augmentation to promote robustness, and downstream task tuning using a gated cross-attention module for multimodal fusion. During fine-tuning, we employ a novel Tabular More vs. Fewer loss that ranks performance based on the amount of available tabular data. Combined with disentangled gradient learning, this enables consistent performance across all tabular data completeness scenarios. We evaluate RoVTL on cardiac MRI scans from the UK Biobank, demonstrating superior robustness to missing tabular data compared to prior methods. Furthermore, RoVTL successfully generalizes to an external cardiac MRI dataset for multimodal disease classification, and extends to the natural images domain, achieving robust performance on a car advertisements dataset.

However, state-of-the-art zero-shot methods typically rely on a sequence of surrogate likelihood functions, whose scores are used as proxies for the ideal score. This procedure however requires vector-Jacobian products through the denoiser at every reverse step, introducing significant memory and runtime overhead.

Unlike humans, who can quickly learn to parse and navigate maps, current models often fail to respect fundamental path constraints, in part due to the prohibitive cost and difficulty of collecting large-scale, pixel-accurate path annotations. To address this, we introduce a scalable synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages synthetic map images and pixel-level parsing to automatically produce precise annotations for this challenging task. Using this pipeline, we construct a fine-tuning dataset of 23k path samples across 4k maps, enabling models to acquire more human-like spatial capabilities. Using this dataset, we fine-tune both open-source and proprietary MLLMs. Results on MapBench show that finetuning substantially improves robustness, raising success rates by up to 6.4 points, while also reducing path-tracing error (NDTW). These gains highlight that fine-grained spatial reasoning, absent in pretrained models, can be explicitly taught with synthetic supervision."}

Mosaics are an ancient art form created by arranging small pieces, called tesserae, on a surface using adhesive. Due to their age and fragility, they are prone to damage, highlighting the need for digital preservation. This paper addresses the problem of digitizing mosaics by segmenting the tesserae to separate them from the background within the broader field of Image Segmentation in Computer Vision. We propose a method leveraging Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) by Meta AI, a foundation model that outperforms most conventional segmentation models, to automatically segment mosaics. Due to the limited open datasets in the field, we also create an annotated dataset of mosaic images to fine-tune and evaluate the model. Quantitative evaluation on our testing dataset shows notable improvements compared to the baseline SAM 2 model, with Intersection over Union increasing from 89.00% to 91.02% and Recall from 92.12% to 95.89%. Additionally, on a benchmark proposed by a prior approach, our model achieves an F-measure 3% higher than previous methods and reduces the error in the absolute difference between predicted and actual tesserae from 0.20 to just 0.02. The notable performance of the fine-tuned SAM 2 model together with the newly annotated dataset can pave the way for real-time segmentation of mosaic images."}

First, a Stable Diffusion model is fine tuned on captioned indoor and outdoor plant imagery to generate realistic, text conditioned images of canola and soybean. Evaluation using Inception Score, Frechet Inception Distance, and downstream phenotype classification shows that synthetic images effectively augment training data and improve accuracy. Second, we bridge the gap between high resolution indoor datasets and limited outdoor imagery using DreamBooth-based text inversion and image guided diffusion, generating translated images that enhance weed detection and classification with YOLOv8.

Existing video generative models struggle to preserve the input video while adding such effects, and current video inpainting methods either require costly per-frame masks or yield implausible results. We introduce augmented compositing, a new task that synthesizes realistic, semi-transparent environmental effects conditioned on text prompts and input video layers, while preserving the original scene. To address this task, we present Over++, a video effect generation framework that makes no assumptions about camera pose, scene stationarity, or depth supervision. We construct a paired effect dataset tailored for this task and introduce an unpaired augmentation strategy that preserves text-driven editability. Our method also supports optional mask control and keyframe guidance without requiring dense annotations. Despite training on limited data, Over++ produces diverse and realistic environmental effects and outperforms existing baselines in both effect generation and scene preservation."}

While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance."}

Super-resolution (SR) can enhance resolution post-scan, yet existing deep learning methods face fidelity-efficiency trade-offs. Purpose: To develop a computationally efficient and accurate deep learning framework for MRI SR that preserves anatomical detail for clinical integration. Materials and Methods: We propose a novel SR framework combining multi-head selective state-space models (MHSSM) with a lightweight channel MLP. The model uses 2D patch extraction with hybrid scanning to capture long-range dependencies. Each MambaFormer block integrates MHSSM, depthwise convolutions, and gated channel mixing. Evaluation used 7T brain T1 MP2RAGE maps (n=142) and 1.5T prostate T2w MRI (n=334). Comparisons included Bicubic interpolation, GANs (CycleGAN, Pix2pix, SPSR), transformers (SwinIR), Mamba (MambaIR), and diffusion models (I2SB, Res-SRDiff).

O3-Bench features challenging problems that require agents to piece together subtle visual information from distinct image areas through multi-step reasoning. The problems are highly challenging even for frontier systems like OpenAI o3, which only obtains 40.8% accuracy on O3-Bench.

We then present a multimodal LLM purpose-trained for this task via reinforcement learning. As a plug-and-play agent, our vSearcher empowers frontier multimodal models (as vReasoners), significantly improving their performance on a wide range of benchmarks.

This disconnect causes current methods to struggle with occluded areas and complex camera trajectories. To bridge this gap, we propose WorldWarp, a framework that couples a 3D structural anchor with a 2D generative refiner. To establish geometric grounding, WorldWarp maintains an online 3D geometric cache built via Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). By explicitly warping historical content into novel views, this cache acts as a structural scaffold, ensuring each new frame respects prior geometry. However, static warping inevitably leaves holes and artifacts due to occlusions. We address this using a Spatio-Temporal Diffusion (ST-Diff) model designed for a \"fill-and-revise\" objective. Our key innovation is a spatio-temporal varying noise schedule: blank regions receive full noise to trigger generation, while warped regions receive partial noise to enable refinement. By dynamically updating the 3D cache at every step, WorldWarp maintains consistency across video chunks. Consequently, it achieves state-of-the-art fidelity by ensuring that 3D logic guides structure while diffusion logic perfects texture.

However, tokenizers are trained to reconstruct clean images from ground-truth tokens, while AR generators are optimized only for token likelihood. This misalignment leads to generated token sequences that may decode into low-quality images, without direct supervision from the pixel space. We propose VA-$π$, a lightweight post-training framework that directly optimizes AR models with a principled pixel-space objective. VA-$π$ formulates the generator-tokenizer alignment as a variational optimization, deriving an evidence lower bound (ELBO) that unifies pixel reconstruction and autoregressive modeling. To optimize under the discrete token space, VA-$π$ introduces a reinforcement-based alignment strategy that treats the AR generator as a policy, uses pixel-space reconstruction quality as its intrinsic reward. The reward is measured by how well the predicted token sequences can reconstruct the original image under teacher forcing, giving the model direct pixel-level guidance without expensive free-running sampling. The regularization term of the ELBO serves as a natural regularizer, maintaining distributional consistency of tokens. VA-$π$ enables rapid adaptation of existing AR generators, without neither tokenizer retraining nor external reward models. With only 1% ImageNet-1K data and 25 minutes of tuning, it reduces FID from 14.36 to 7.65 and improves IS from 86.55 to 116.70 on LlamaGen-XXL, while also yielding notable gains in the text-to-image task on GenEval for both visual generation model (LlamaGen: from 0.306 to 0.339) and unified multi-modal model (Janus-Pro: from 0.725 to 0.744).

To bridge this gap, we introduce a large-scale benchmark built from pedestrian-perspective videos captured with synchronized stereo cameras, LiDAR, and IMU/GPS sensors. This dataset provides metrically precise 3D information, enabling the automatic generation of spatial reasoning questions that span a hierarchical spectrum--from qualitative relational reasoning to quantitative metric and kinematic understanding. Evaluations reveal that the performance gains observed in structured indoor benchmarks vanish in open-world settings. Further analysis using synthetic abnormal scenes and blinding tests confirms that current MLLMs depend heavily on linguistic priors instead of grounded visual reasoning. Our benchmark thus provides a principled platform for diagnosing these limitations and advancing physically grounded spatial intelligence."}

The lack of such consistency results in the failure in maintaining key visual features (like human ID, object attribute, style). To this end, we integrate the visual context consistency into the reasoning of unified models, explicitly motivating the model to sustain such consistency by 1) Adaptive Visual Planning: generating structured visual check list to figure out the visual element of needed consistency keeping, and 2) Iterative Visual Correction: performing self-reflection with the guidance of check lists and refining the generated result in an iterative manner. To achieve this, we use supervised finetuning to teach the model how to plan the visual checking, conduct self-reflection and self-refinement, and use flow-GRPO to further enhance the visual consistency through a customized visual checking reward.

This heuristic finding offers a unifying perspective that ties encoder behavior to its underlying spectral structure. We define it as the Prism Hypothesis, where each data modality can be viewed as a projection of the natural world onto a shared feature spectrum, just like the prism. Building on this insight, we propose Unified Autoencoding (UAE), a model that harmonizes semantic structure and pixel details via an innovative frequency-band modulator, enabling their seamless coexistence. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS-COCO benchmarks validate that our UAE effectively unifies semantic abstraction and pixel-level fidelity into a single latent space with state-of-the-art performance."}

Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers."}

However, they typically mimic expert trajectories without predictive motion reasoning, which limits their ability to reason about what actions to take. To address this limitation, we propose joint learning with motion image diffusion, a novel strategy that enhances VLA models with motion reasoning capabilities. Our method extends the VLA architecture with a dual-head design: while the action head predicts action chunks as in vanilla VLAs, an additional motion head, implemented as a Diffusion Transformer (DiT), predicts optical-flow-based motion images that capture future dynamics. The two heads are trained jointly, enabling the shared VLM backbone to learn representations that couple robot control with motion knowledge. This joint learning builds temporally coherent and physically grounded representations without modifying the inference pathway of standard VLAs, thereby maintaining test-time latency. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that joint learning with motion image diffusion improves the success rate of pi-series VLAs to 97.5% on the LIBERO benchmark and 58.0% on the RoboTwin benchmark, yielding a 23% improvement in real-world performance and validating its effectiveness in enhancing the motion reasoning capability of large-scale VLAs."}

While vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate strong generalization, current benchmarks provide limited understanding of how embodiment -- i.e., the choice of physical platform, sensor configuration, and modality alignment -- influences perception, reasoning, and control. We introduce Embodied4C, a closed-loop benchmark designed as a Turing test for embodied reasoning. The benchmark evaluates the core embodied capabilities of VLMs across three heterogeneous embodiments -- autonomous vehicles, aerial drones, and robotic manipulators -- through approximately 1.1K one-shot reasoning questions and 58 goal-directed navigation tasks. These tasks jointly assess four foundational dimensions: semantic, spatial, temporal, and physical reasoning. Each embodiment presents dynamic sensor configurations and environment variations to probe generalization beyond platform-specific adaptation. To prevent embodiment overfitting, Embodied4C integrates domain-far queries targeting abstract and cross-context reasoning. Comprehensive evaluation across ten state-of-the-art VLMs and four embodied control baselines shows that cross-modal alignment and instruction tuning matter more than scale, while spatial and temporal reasoning remains the primary bottleneck for reliable embodied competence."}

However, prevalent group-based algorithms such as GRPO require multi-rollout sampling for each prompt. While more efficient single-rollout variants have recently been explored in text-only settings, we find that they suffer from severe instability in multimodal contexts, often leading to training collapse. To address this training efficiency-stability trade-off, we introduce $\\textbf{MSSR}$ (Multimodal Stabilized Single-Rollout), a group-free RLVR framework that achieves both stable optimization and effective multimodal reasoning performance. MSSR achieves this via an entropy-based advantage-shaping mechanism that adaptively regularizes advantage magnitudes, preventing collapse and maintaining training stability. While such mechanisms have been used in group-based RLVR, we show that in the multimodal single-rollout setting they are not merely beneficial but essential for stability. In in-distribution evaluations, MSSR demonstrates superior training compute efficiency, achieving similar validation accuracy to the group-based baseline with half the training steps. When trained for the same number of steps, MSSR's performance surpasses the group-based baseline and shows consistent generalization improvements across five diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks. Together, these results demonstrate that MSSR enables stable, compute-efficient, and effective RLVR for complex multimodal reasoning tasks."}

However, it faces a critical barrier in the modern era of low precision computing: numerical instability. As tiles scale to maximize efficiency (e.g., F(6,3), F(8,3)), the condition numbers of standard integer based transforms explode, reaching kappa = 2 x 10^5 for F(8,3), rendering them unusable in FP16 or Int8. We introduce NOVA (Numerical Optimization of Vandermonde Arithmetic), a discovery framework that breaks the decades old convention of integer interpolation. Treating Winograd point selection as a continuous optimization problem, NOVA searches the manifold R^n-1 via Evolution Strategy, snaps candidates to simple rationals, and guarantees correctness via symbolic verification. This process uncovers a hidden landscape of stable, fractional configurations such as {+-5/6, +-7/6, +-3/5} that defy traditional vocabulary constraints. The impact is transformative: NOVA improves the conditioning of F(8,3) by 415x in 1D, which squares to a 172,484x improvement for 2D convolution. In real world FP16 ImageNet inference, where standard transforms collapse to random chance (e.g., 4.7 percent accuracy on VGG16), NOVA's points restore full accuracy (75 to 78 percent), recovering over 70 percentage points without retraining, calibration, or learned parameters. These discovered transforms act as drop in replacements, effectively unlocking the efficiency of large tile Winograd convolution for next generation hardware."}

A diffusion-based VLA policy proposes diverse candidate actions, a generative video world model simulates their visual and reward outcomes, and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) selectively refines plans through lookahead evaluation. Experiments on the SimplerEnv manipulation benchmark demonstrate that STORM achieves a new state-of-the-art average success rate of 51.0 percent, outperforming strong baselines such as CogACT.

We introduce a camera-only E2E offline RL framework that performs no additional exploration and trains solely on a fixed simulator dataset. Offline RL offers strong data efficiency and rapid experimental iteration, yet is susceptible to instability from overestimation on out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, we construct pseudo ground-truth trajectories from expert driving logs and use them as a behavior regularization signal, suppressing imitation of unsafe or suboptimal behavior while stabilizing value learning. Training and closed-loop evaluation are conducted in a neural rendering environment learned from the public nuScenes dataset. Empirically, the proposed method achieves substantial improvements in collision rate and route completion compared with IL baselines. Our code will be available at [URL]."}

First, we adapt a broad suite of unlearning methods to quantum settings, including gradient-based, distillation-based, regularization-based and certified techniques. Second, we introduce two new unlearning strategies tailored to hybrid models. Experiments across Iris, MNIST, and Fashion-MNIST, under both subset removal and full-class deletion, reveal that quantum models can support effective unlearning, but outcomes depend strongly on circuit depth, entanglement structure, and task complexity. Shallow VQCs display high intrinsic stability with minimal memorization, whereas deeper hybrid models exhibit stronger trade-offs between utility, forgetting strength, and alignment with retrain oracle. We find that certain methods, e.g. EU-k, LCA, and Certified Unlearning, consistently provide the best balance across metrics.

Model merging aims to merge the distinct capabilities of these specialised models into a unified model, requiring minimal or even no additional training. A core objective of model merging is to ensure the merged model retains the behavioural characteristics of the specialised models, typically achieved through feature alignment. We identify that features consist of two critical components: direction and magnitude. Prior research has predominantly focused on directional alignment, while the influence of magnitude remains largely neglected, despite its pronounced vulnerability to perturbations introduced by common merging operations (e.g., parameter fusion and sparsification). Such perturbations to magnitude inevitably lead to feature deviations in the merged model from the specialised models, resulting in subsequent performance degradation. To address this, we propose MAGnItude Calibration (MAGIC), a plug-and-play framework that rectifies layer-wise magnitudes in feature and weight spaces, with three variants. Specifically, our Feature Space Calibration (FSC) realigns the merged model's features using a small set of unlabelled data, while Weight Space Calibration (WSC) extends this calibration to the weight space without requiring additional data. Combining these yields Dual Space Calibration (DSC). Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC consistently boosts performance across diverse Computer Vision tasks (+4.3% on eight datasets) and NLP tasks (+8.0% on Llama) without additional training.

To reduce repetitive data collection, we present Real2Edit2Real, a framework that generates new demonstrations by bridging 3D editability with 2D visual data through a 3D control interface. Our approach first reconstructs scene geometry from multi-view RGB observations with a metric-scale 3D reconstruction model. Based on the reconstructed geometry, we perform depth-reliable 3D editing on point clouds to generate new manipulation trajectories while geometrically correcting the robot poses to recover physically consistent depth, which serves as a reliable condition for synthesizing new demonstrations. Finally, we propose a multi-conditional video generation model guided by depth as the primary control signal, together with action, edge, and ray maps, to synthesize spatially augmented multi-view manipulation videos. Experiments on four real-world manipulation tasks demonstrate that policies trained on data generated from only 1-5 source demonstrations can match or outperform those trained on 50 real-world demonstrations, improving data efficiency by up to 10-50x.
