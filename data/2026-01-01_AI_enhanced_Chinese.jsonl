Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eDepth Anything V2\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5411\u91cf\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u5c06\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u624b\u672f\u5185\u955c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5145\u6ee1\u955c\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6db2\u4f53\u7684\u5185\u955c\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8584\u624b\u672f\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u900f\u660e\u8868\u9762\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u8fb9\u754c\u584c\u9677\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528Depth Anything V2\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u5411\u91cf\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u9ad8\u955c\u9762\u53cd\u5c04\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728SCARED\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.1%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff08<1.25\u9608\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5e73\u65b9\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8617%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u624b\u672f\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5408\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u9002\u5e94\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u5185\u955c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u624b\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach.

However, the reliance on annotated 3D data collected in controlled environments poses challenges for generalization to diverse in-the-wild scenarios. Existing domain adaptation (DA) paradigms like general DA and source-free DA for 3D HPE overlook the issues of non-stationary target pose datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a novel task named lifelong domain adaptive 3D HPE. To our knowledge, we are the first to introduce the lifelong domain adaptation to the 3D HPE task. In this lifelong DA setting, the pose estimator is pretrained on the source domain and subsequently adapted to distinct target domains. Moreover, during adaptation to the current target domain, the pose estimator cannot access the source and all the previous target domains. The lifelong DA for 3D HPE involves overcoming challenges in adapting to current domain poses and preserving knowledge from previous domains, particularly combating catastrophic forgetting. We present an innovative Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) framework, which incorporates 3D pose generators, a 2D pose discriminator, and a 3D pose estimator.

IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2026", "summary": "Prehensile autonomous manipulation, such as peg insertion, tool use, or assembly, require precise in-hand understanding of the object pose and the extrinsic contacts made during interactions. Providing accurate estimation of pose and contacts is challenging. Tactile sensors can provide local geometry at the sensor and force information about the grasp, but the locality of sensing means resolving poses and contacts from tactile alone is often an ill-posed problem, as multiple configurations can be consistent with the observations. Adding visual feedback can help resolve ambiguities, but can suffer from noise and occlusions. In this work, we propose a method that pairs local observations from sensing with the physical constraints of contact. We propose a set of factors that ensure local consistency with tactile observations as well as enforcing physical plausibility, namely, that the estimated pose and contacts must respect the kinematic and force constraints of quasi-static rigid body interactions. We formalize our problem as a factor graph, allowing for efficient estimation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms existing geometric and contact-informed estimation pipelines, especially when only tactile information is available.

In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u901a\u8fc7Petri\u7f51\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u6e38\u620f\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e26\u5bbd\u6d88\u8017\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u9ad8\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6076\u610f\u6d3b\u52a8\u3002\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u6b64\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\uff1a\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bc6\u522b\u6e38\u620f\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684Petri\u7f51\u3001\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u6d41\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u540c\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "result": "\u5728UPSIDE\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u95f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8fbe94.02%\uff0c\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u5ea6\u8fbe174.99%\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6e38\u620f\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523073.84% AUC\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6316\u6398\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u5efa\u6a21\u6e38\u620f\u7f51\u7edc\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u548c\u7279\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05).

Consequently, they struggle with contact-rich manipulation tasks that require reasoning about force, texture, and slip. While some approaches incorporate low-dimensional tactile signals, they fail to capture the high-resolution dynamics essential for such interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce DreamTacVLA, a framework that grounds VLA models in contact physics by learning to feel the future. Our model adopts a hierarchical perception scheme in which high-resolution tactile images serve as micro-vision inputs coupled with wrist-camera local vision and third-person macro vision. To reconcile these multi-scale sensory streams, we first train a unified policy with a Hierarchical Spatial Alignment (HSA) loss that aligns tactile tokens with their spatial counterparts in the wrist and third-person views. To further deepen the model's understanding of fine-grained contact dynamics, we finetune the system with a tactile world model that predicts future tactile signals. To mitigate tactile data scarcity and the wear-prone nature of tactile sensors, we construct a hybrid large-scale dataset sourced from both high-fidelity digital twin and real-world experiments. By anticipating upcoming tactile states, DreamTacVLA acquires a rich model of contact physics and conditions its actions on both real observations and imagined consequences. Across contact-rich manipulation tasks, it outperforms state-of-the-art VLA baselines, achieving up to 95% success, highlighting the importance of understanding physical contact for robust, touch-aware robotic agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamTacVLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u89e6\u89c9\u7269\u7406\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89e6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u65e0\u6cd5\u611f\u77e5\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u529b\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u6ed1\u52a8\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u53c8\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u89e6\u89c9\u56fe\u50cf\u3001\u624b\u8155\u76f8\u673a\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7b2c\u4e09\u4eba\u79f0\u5b8f\u89c2\u89c6\u89c9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u7edf\u4e00\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u89e6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u89e6\u89c9\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cDreamTacVLA\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u9ad8\u8fbe95%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7406\u89e3\u7269\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u5177\u6709\u89e6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4ee3\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cDreamTacVLA\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u89e6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u63a5\u89e6\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u3002"}}

Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects.

Although laser LiDAR offers the advantage of a wide field of view, its application in UAV exploration still faces several challenges. The observation quality of LiDAR point clouds is generally inferior to that of depth cameras. Traditional frontier methods based on known and unknown regions impose a heavy computational burden, especially when handling the wide field of view of LiDAR. In addition, regions without point cloud are also difficult to classify as free space through raycasting. To address these problems, the SHIELD is proposed. It maintains an observation-quality occupancy map and performs ray-casting on this map to address the issue of inconsistent point-cloud quality during exploration. A hybrid frontier method is used to tackle both the computational burden and the limitations of point-cloud quality exploration. In addition, an outward spherical-projection ray-casting strategy is proposed to jointly ensure flight safety and exploration efficiency in open areas. Simulations and flight experiments prove the effectiveness of SHIELD. This work will be open-sourced to contribute to the research community.", "AI": {"tldr": "SHIELD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLiDAR\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7403\u9762\u6295\u5f71\u6df7\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u96c6\u6210\u89e3\u51b3LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u533a\u57df\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "LiDAR\u5728UAV\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u70b9\u4e91\u89c2\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u5dee\u3001\u4f20\u7edf\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u91cd\u3001\u65e0\u70b9\u4e91\u533a\u57df\u96be\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u7ebf\u6295\u5c04\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u81ea\u7531\u7a7a\u95f4\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u89c2\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u5360\u636e\u5730\u56fe\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u8fb9\u754c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u5916\u5411\u7403\u9762\u6295\u5f71\u5149\u7ebf\u6295\u5c04\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5904\u7406\u70b9\u4e91\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u98de\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SHIELD\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u786e\u4fdd\u98de\u884c\u5b89\u5168\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "SHIELD\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LiDAR\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u63a2\u7d22\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee5\u8d21\u732e\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u3002"}}

Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\\mathbf\u03b8$ given observed data $\\mathbf{x}_{\\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5904\u7406\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u65f6\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6a21\u62df\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u51fd\u6570\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f3c\u7136\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f4\u63a5\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u6837\u672c\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3aSBI\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684SBI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u524d\u5411\u52a0\u566a\u3001\u53cd\u5411\u65f6\u95f4SDE/ODE\u3001\u6982\u7387\u6d41\u548c\u53bb\u566a\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u7b49\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u5206\u6570\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u4f3c\u7136\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u6587\u7ae0\u7efc\u5408\u4e86\u4ece\u859b\u5b9a\u8c14\u6865\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u5e8f\u8d2f\u540e\u9a8c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6570\u636e\u7684\u644a\u9500\u67b6\u6784\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5148\u9a8c\u9002\u5e94\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728SBI\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u8bbe\u3001\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6216\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4ee5\u53ca\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6d41\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u540e\u9a8c/\u4f3c\u7136\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684SBI\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5730\u7403\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u79d1\u5b66\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u7b49\u65b0\u6743\u8861\u4ecd\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6587\u7ae0\u6700\u540e\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Prior to the recent surge of language-based and multimodal interfaces, we developed and evaluated an early-stage prototype in 2020 that combined natural-language text chat with freehand sketch annotations over the robot's live camera view to support remote intervention. We evaluated three modes - autonomous, remote, and hybrid - in controlled fetch-and-carry tasks using a domestic mobile manipulator (HSR) on a World Robot Summit 2020 rule-compliant test field. The results show systematic mode-dependent differences in user-rated affinity and additional insights on perceived security, indicating that switching or blending agency within one robot measurably shapes human impressions.

This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern \"Red AI\" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural \"important features\" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.\n  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3.

However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively.

Stringent safety requirements make high fidelity one of the key metrics for simulation platforms. Despite advancements in simulation platforms for low-altitude UAVs, there is still a shortage of platforms that feature rich traffic scenarios, high-precision UAV and scenario simulators, and comprehensive testing capabilities for low-altitude traffic. Therefore, this paper introduces an integrated high-fidelity simulation platform for low-altitude UAV traffic. This platform simulates all components of the UAV traffic network, including the control system, the traffic management system, the UAV system, the communication network , the anomaly and fault modules, etc. Furthermore, it integrates RflySim/AirSim and Unreal Engine 5 to develop full-state models of UAVs and 3D maps that model the real world using the oblique photogrammetry technique. Additionally, the platform offers a wide range of interfaces, and all models and scenarios can be customized with a high degree of flexibility.

We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.\n  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9e\u5b58\u5728\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7279\u6743\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\u662f\u5426\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f9d\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u4e86Pythia\u3001Phi-2\u3001Llama-3\u548cMistral\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u5c42\u503c\u8868\u793a\u6cbf\u5355\u4e00\u4e3b\u5bfc\u8f74\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u8be5\u8f74\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9Pythia-410M\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9a\u5411\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u79fb\u9664\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u6240\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u90fd\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4f4e\u7ef4\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u57df\u9650\u5236\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u538b\u7f29\u5230\u4e0e\u5408\u6210\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u76f8\u540c\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u3002\u5e72\u9884\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6270\u52a8\u71b5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f74\u4f1a\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7834\u574f\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u4f46\u5355\u5c42\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u884c\u4e3a\u9000\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u652f\u6301\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u6cbf\u7740\u8fd9\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5176\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u662f\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7279\u6743\u8bfb\u53d6\u673a\u5236\u800c\u975e\u5355\u4e00\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains.

While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) improve semantic generalization, insufficient embodied reasoning leads to brittle behavior, and conversely, strong reasoning alone is inadequate without precise control. To provide a decoupled and quantitative assessment of this bottleneck, we introduce Embodied Reasoning Intelligence Quotient (ERIQ), a large-scale embodied reasoning benchmark in robotic manipulation, comprising 6K+ question-answer pairs across four reasoning dimensions. By decoupling reasoning from execution, ERIQ enables systematic evaluation and reveals a strong positive correlation between embodied reasoning capability and end-to-end VLA generalization. To bridge the gap from reasoning to precise execution, we propose FACT, a flow-matching-based action tokenizer that converts continuous control into discrete sequences while preserving high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction. The resulting GenieReasoner jointly optimizes reasoning and action in a unified space, outperforming both continuous-action and prior discrete-action baselines in real-world tasks.

We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes.

These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u57f9\u8bad\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u624b\u672f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u9ad8\u548c\u8017\u65f6\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eYOLO\u548cDeepSORT\u7684\u5668\u68b0\u5c16\u7aef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u76f8\u4f3c\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u624b\u672f\u624b\u52bf\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5757\u3002", "result": "\u572858\u4e2a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u7684\u5fae\u8840\u7ba1\u543b\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e27\u7ea7\u52a8\u4f5c\u5206\u5272\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523092.4%\uff0c\u6280\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523085.5%\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u590d\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5fae\u5916\u79d1\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5ba2\u89c2\u5b9e\u65f6\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u3001\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u57f9\u8bad\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u624b\u672f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly.

Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy.

Accepted at IJCNN 2025 (Rome, Italy). To appear in IEEE/IJCNN 2025 proceedings", "summary": "Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations.

MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency.

Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo.

Karlsson", "Wenjun Wu"], "title": "RANGER: A Monocular Zero-Shot Semantic Navigation Framework through Contextual Adaptation", "comment": null, "summary": "Efficiently finding targets in complex environments is fundamental to real-world embodied applications. While recent advances in multimodal foundation models have enabled zero-shot object goal navigation, allowing robots to search for arbitrary objects without fine-tuning, existing methods face two key limitations: (1) heavy reliance on precise depth and pose information provided by simulators, which restricts applicability in real-world scenarios; and (2) lack of in-context learning (ICL) capability, making it difficult to quickly adapt to new environments, as in leveraging short videos. To address these challenges, we propose RANGER, a novel zero-shot, open-vocabulary semantic navigation framework that operates using only a monocular camera. Leveraging powerful 3D foundation models, RANGER eliminates the dependency on depth and pose while exhibiting strong ICL capability. By simply observing a short video of a new environment, the system can also significantly improve task efficiency without requiring architectural modifications or fine-tuning. The framework integrates several key components: keyframe-based 3D reconstruction, semantic point cloud generation, vision-language model (VLM)-driven exploration value estimation, high-level adaptive waypoint selection, and low-level action execution. Experiments on the HM3D benchmark and real-world environments demonstrate that RANGER achieves competitive performance in terms of navigation success rate and exploration efficiency, while showing superior ICL adaptability, with no previous 3D mapping of the environment required.", "AI": {"tldr": "RANGER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c2\u5bdf\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u7cbe\u786e\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u9650\u5236\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u96be\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u73af\u5883\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u70b9\u4e91\u751f\u6210\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u4ef7\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u9ad8\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8def\u5f84\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u4f4e\u5c42\u52a8\u4f5c\u6267\u884c\u3002", "result": "\u5728HM3D\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0cRANGER\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RANGER\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, network traffic classification is a challenging domain, and trained models may degrade soon after deployment due to the obsolete datasets and quick evolution of computer networks as new or updated protocols appear. Moreover, significant change in the behavior of a traffic type (and, therefore, the underlying features representing the traffic) can produce a large and sudden performance drop of the deployed model, known as a data or concept drift. In most cases, complete retraining is performed, often without further investigation of root causes, as good dataset quality is assumed. However, this is not always the case and further investigation must be performed. This paper proposes a novel methodology to evaluate the stability of datasets and a benchmark workflow that can be used to compare datasets.\n  The proposed framework is based on a concept drift detection method that also uses ML feature weights to boost the detection performance. The benefits of this work are demonstrated on CESNET-TLS-Year22 dataset.

Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u56fe\u5916\u63a8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f30\u8ba1\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u5e76\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u5f624D\u9ad8\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684LiDAR\u70b9\u4e91\u30013D\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u548c\u8f66\u9053\u6807\u6ce8\u7b49\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u5916\u63a8\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5168\u5c40\u9759\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u548c\u9010\u5e27\u52a8\u6001\u70b9\u4e91\u5e76\u878d\u5408\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u53d8\u5f624D\u9ad8\u65af\u6846\u67b6\u91cd\u5efa\u573a\u666f\uff1b3. \u521d\u59cb4D\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9000\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u6e32\u67d3\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u53cd\u9988\u8bad\u7ec34D\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u76f4\u81f3\u8fbe\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u89c6\u89d2\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5916\u63a8\u65f6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u53ef\u9009\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u56fe\u5916\u63a8\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u5148\u9a8c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, conventional control algorithms for trajectory tracking often exhibit limited performance due to the underactuated, nonlinear, and highly coupled dynamics of quadrotor systems. To address these challenges, we propose HBO-PID, a novel control algorithm that integrates the Heteroscedastic Bayesian Optimization (HBO) framework with the classical PID controller to achieve accurate and robust trajectory tracking. By explicitly modeling input-dependent noise variance, the proposed method can better adapt to dynamic and complex environments, and therefore improve the accuracy and robustness of trajectory tracking. To accelerate the convergence of optimization, we adopt a two-stage optimization strategy that allow us to more efficiently find the optimal controller parameters.

We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors.

In recent years, data-driven constrained motion planning algorithms have shown impressive planning speed and success rate. Among them, the latent motion method based on manifold approximation is the most efficient planning algorithm. Due to errors in manifold approximation and the difficulty in accurately identifying collision conflicts within the latent space, time-consuming path validity checks and path replanning are required. In this paper, we propose a method that trains a neural network to predict the minimum distance between the robot and obstacles using latent vectors as inputs. The learned distance gradient is then used to calculate the direction of movement in the latent space to move the robot away from obstacles. Based on this, a local path optimization algorithm in the latent space is proposed, and it is integrated with the path validity checking process to reduce the time of replanning.

Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data.

Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGCA-ResUNet\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u7ec4\u5750\u6807\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301CNN\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709CNN\u548cTransformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3U-Net\u7b49CNN\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f9d\u8d56\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53caTransformer\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bfb\u6c42\u5728\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u5206\u7ec4\u5750\u6807\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08GCA\uff09\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u9053\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u591a\u7ec4\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u8bed\u4e49\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u5750\u6807\u7f16\u7801\u6765\u6355\u6349\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5782\u76f4\u8f74\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "result": "\u5728Synapse\u548cACDC\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523086.11%\u548c92.64%\u7684Dice\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eSwin-UNet\u548cTransUNet\u7b49\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u5c0f\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u5272\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "GCA-ResUNet\u5728\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u5229\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Most existing approaches rely on single-frame observation and employ simple concatenation for multi-modal fusion, which limits their ability to capture temporal context and hinders dynamic adaptability. To address these challenges, we propose a DRL-based navigation framework, DRL-TH, which leverages temporal graph attention and hierarchical graph pooling to integrate historical observations and adaptively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a temporal-guided graph attention network (TG-GAT) that incorporates temporal weights into attention scores to capture correlations between consecutive frames, thereby enabling the implicit estimation of scene evolution. In addition, we design a graph hierarchical abstraction module (GHAM) that applies hierarchical pooling and learnable weighted fusion to dynamically integrate RGB and LiDAR features, achieving balanced representation across multiple scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DRL-TH outperforms existing methods in various crowded environments.

The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \\textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features.

However, prior real-world RL methods often assume that human interventions are optimal across the entire state space, overlooking the fact that even expert operators cannot consistently provide optimal actions in all states or completely avoid mistakes. Indiscriminately mixing intervention data with robot-collected data inherits the sample inefficiency of RL, while purely imitating intervention data can ultimately degrade the final performance achievable by RL. The question of how to leverage potentially suboptimal and noisy human interventions to accelerate learning without being constrained by them thus remains open. To address this challenge, we propose SiLRI, a state-wise Lagrangian reinforcement learning algorithm for real-world robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we formulate the online manipulation problem as a constrained RL optimization, where the constraint bound at each state is determined by the uncertainty of human interventions. We then introduce a state-wise Lagrange multiplier and solve the problem via a min-max optimization, jointly optimizing the policy and the Lagrange multiplier to reach a saddle point. Built upon a human-as-copilot teleoperation system, our algorithm is evaluated through real-world experiments on diverse manipulation tasks. Experimental results show that SiLRI effectively exploits human suboptimal interventions, reducing the time required to reach a 90% success rate by at least 50% compared with the state-of-the-art RL method HIL-SERL, and achieving a 100% success rate on long-horizon manipulation tasks where other RL methods struggle to succeed.

The resulting computation is structured for streaming parallelism, enabling critical kernels to be fully parallelized on the FPGA.

The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u75283D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4f1a\u5bf9\u63a5\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u672a\u77e5\u822a\u5929\u56683D\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u6539\u5584\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4f1a\u5bf9\u63a5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u76ee\u6807\u822a\u5929\u5668\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u9762\u4e34\u52a8\u6001\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf3DGS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u592a\u7a7a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u52303DGS\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u9ad8\u6e32\u67d3\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5149\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u5149\u7167\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5149\u7167\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u5168\u5c40\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u81ea\u906e\u6321\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u5149\u5ea6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u592a\u9633\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5148\u9a8c\u76843DGS\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u822a\u5929\u56683D\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u6e38\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned.

However, processing complex three-dimensional (3D) multimodal medical images poses significant challenges - specifically, the effective integration of complementary information and the occasional oversight of subtle yet critical pathological features. To address these issues, we present a novel two-stage fusion framework termed Hilbert-VLM. This framework leverages the HilbertMed-SAM module for precise lesion segmentation, with the generated multimodal enhanced prompts then guiding the VLM toward accurate disease classification. Our key innovation lies in the systematic redesign of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) architecture: we incorporate Hilbert space-filling curves into the scanning mechanism of the Mamba State Space Model (SSM) to maximize the preservation of spatial locality in 3D data, a property critical for medical image analysis. We also introduce a novel Hilbert-Mamba Cross-Attention (HMCA) mechanism and a scale-aware decoder to capture fine-grained details. Meanwhile, the prompt enhancement module unifies segmentation masks and their corresponding textual attributes into an information-dense prompt to support VLM inference. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness of the Hilbert-VLM model. On the BraTS2021 segmentation benchmark, it achieves a Dice score of 82.35 percent, with a diagnostic classification accuracy (ACC) of 78.85 percent.

To enable MPC, control-augmented modelling and system identification of the RAAVEN small uncrewed aircraft is presented. Two formulations of MPC are then showcased. The first schedules a static reference path rate over the MPC horizon, incentivizing a constant inertial speed. The second, with inspiration from model predictive contouring control, dynamically optimizes for the reference path rate over the controller horizon as the system operates. This allows for a weighted tradeoff between path progression and distance from path, two competing objectives in path-following guidance.

RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "FineFT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u52a0\u5bc6\u8d27\u5e01\u671f\u8d27\u4ea4\u6613\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u96c6\u6210\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u7b5b\u9009\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u9ad8\u6760\u6746\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6760\u6746\u7684\u671f\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\uff0c\u9762\u4e34\u5956\u52b1\u6ce2\u52a8\u5927\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u4ee5\u53ca\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\u81ea\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9636\u6bb5I\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210TD\u8bef\u5dee\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0Q\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u63d0\u9ad8\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff1b\u9636\u6bb5II\u57fa\u4e8e\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u7b5b\u9009Q\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3VAE\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u9636\u6bb5III\u6839\u636eVAE\u6307\u5bfc\u5728\u7b5b\u9009\u540e\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4fdd\u5b88\u7b56\u7565\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u6536\u76ca\u4e0e\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u4ea4\u6613\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\uff0cFineFT\u57286\u4e2a\u91d1\u878d\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e12\u4e2aSOTA\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u98ce\u9669\u964d\u4f4e40%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u4e8e\u7b2c\u4e8c\u540d\u7684\u76c8\u5229\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u663e\u793a\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e13\u7cbe\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u5e02\u573a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "FineFT\u901a\u8fc7\u96c6\u6210\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u6760\u6746\u671f\u8d27\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u4ea4\u6613\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u901f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6e90\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8f6c\u6362\u4e2d\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b58\u5728\u7d2f\u79ef\u901f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "CVC\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6d41\u5f0f\u7f16\u8f91\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5df2\u77e5\u6e90\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u89c6\u89d2\u901f\u5ea6\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff08\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u652f\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u652f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u548cTweedie\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u6765\u8865\u507f\u91cf\u5316\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCVC\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5fe0\u5b9e\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8bed\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d consistently \u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "CVC\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6d41\u5f0f\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u8f6c\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we present GMLD, a learning-based local descriptor framework for large-scale multi-session point cloud map merging that systematically aligns maps collected across different sessions with overlapping regions. The proposed framework employs a keypoint-aware encoder and a plane-based geometric transformer to extract discriminative features for loop closure detection and relative pose estimation.

Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control.

The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing.

However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding.

Yet these models primarily describe what they perceive and intend to do, rarely questioning whether their planned actions are safe or appropriate. This work introduces Counterfactual VLA (CF-VLA), a self-reflective VLA framework that enables the model to reason about and revise its planned actions before execution. CF-VLA first generates time-segmented meta-actions that summarize driving intent, and then performs counterfactual reasoning conditioned on both the meta-actions and the visual context. This step simulates potential outcomes, identifies unsafe behaviors, and outputs corrected meta-actions that guide the final trajectory generation. To efficiently obtain such self-reflective capabilities, we propose a rollout-filter-label pipeline that mines high-value scenes from a base (non-counterfactual) VLA's rollouts and labels counterfactual reasoning traces for subsequent training rounds. Experiments on large-scale driving datasets show that CF-VLA improves trajectory accuracy by up to 17.6%, enhances safety metrics by 20.5%, and exhibits adaptive thinking: it only enables counterfactual reasoning in challenging scenarios. By transforming reasoning traces from one-shot descriptions to causal self-correction signals, CF-VLA takes a step toward self-reflective autonomous driving agents that learn to think before they act.", "AI": {"tldr": "CF-VLA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8ba9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6267\u884c\u524d\u8d28\u7591\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u63cf\u8ff0\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u8d28\u7591\u8ba1\u5212\u884c\u52a8\u662f\u5426\u5b89\u5168\u6216\u9002\u5f53\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u603b\u7ed3\u9a7e\u9a76\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u57fa\u4e8e\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u679c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u8f93\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u540e\u7684\u5143\u52a8\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f68\u8ff9\u751f\u6210", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u9a7e\u9a76\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cCF-VLA\u5c06\u8f68\u8ff9\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u534717.6%\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6307\u6807\u63d0\u534720.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u542f\u7528\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406", "conclusion": "CF-VLA\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ece\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u63cf\u8ff0\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6267\u884c\u524d\u601d\u8003\u7684\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4ee3\u7406\u8fc8\u51fa\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65"}}

MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation.

In robotics, they are particularly valuable because they capture objects in a form that aligns directly with how robots interact with the physical world, enabling core capabilities such as predicting stable grasps, detecting collisions, and simulating dynamics. Although automatic 3D mesh generation methods have shown promising progress in recent years, potentially offering a path toward real-time robot perception, two critical challenges remain. First, generating high-fidelity meshes is prohibitively slow for real-time use, often requiring tens of seconds per object. Second, mesh generation by itself is insufficient. In robotics, a mesh must be contextually grounded, i.e., correctly segmented from the scene and registered with the proper scale and pose. Additionally, unless these contextual grounding steps remain efficient, they simply introduce new bottlenecks. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end system that addresses these challenges, producing a high-quality, contextually grounded 3D mesh from a single RGB-D image in under one second. Our pipeline integrates open-vocabulary object segmentation, accelerated diffusion-based mesh generation, and robust point cloud registration, each optimized for both speed and accuracy. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a real-world manipulation task, showing that it enables meshes to be used as a practical, on-demand representation for robotics perception and planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u57281\u79d2\u5185\u4ece\u5355\u5f20RGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a5\u5730\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a5\u5730\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u7f51\u683c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7f51\u683c\u901f\u5ea6\u8fc7\u6162\uff08\u9700\u6570\u5341\u79d2\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a5\u5730\uff08\u5982\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u5272\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u914d\u51c6\u548c\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u96c6\u6210\u5f00\u653e\u8bcd\u6c47\u5bf9\u8c61\u5206\u5272\u3001\u52a0\u901f\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u70b9\u4e91\u914d\u51c6\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u90fd\u9488\u5bf9\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c063D\u7f51\u683c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6309\u9700\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4eceRGB-D\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a5\u57303D\u7f51\u683c\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5b9e\u65f6\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment.

Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RSAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u6b21\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u9884\u6d4b\u50cf\u7d20\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u9a71\u52a8\u5916\u90e8\u5206\u5272\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u805a\u7126\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRSAgent\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u5de5\u5177\u8c03\u7528\u6765\u4ea4\u66ff\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5206\u5272\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5272\u5de5\u5177\u7bb1\u3001\u89c2\u5bdf\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u3001\u5229\u7528\u5386\u53f2\u89c2\u5bdf\u4fee\u8ba2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5047\u8bbe\u6765\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76ee\u6807\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u63a9\u7801\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u591a\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5272\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u63a5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "RSAgent\u5728ReasonSeg\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8666.5%\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672cgIoU\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6bd4Seg-Zero-7B\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e869%\uff1b\u5728RefCOCOg\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523081.5%\u7684cIoU\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u548c\u9886\u57df\u5916\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u90fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RSAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5272\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

The main paper has 16 figures", "summary": "The draft IMO MASS Code requires autonomous and remotely supervised maritime vessels to detect departures from their operational design domain, enter a predefined fallback that notifies the operator, permit immediate human override, and avoid changing the voyage plan without approval. Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained vision-language model (VLM) fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation.

They rely on linear recurrences to integrate information over time, enabling fast inference, parallelizable training, and control over recurrence stability. However, traditional SSMs often suffer from limited effective memory, requiring larger state sizes for improved recall. Moreover, existing SSMs struggle to capture multi-scale dependencies, which are essential for modeling complex structures in time series, images, and natural language. This paper introduces a multi-scale SSM framework that addresses these limitations by representing sequence dynamics across multiple resolution and processing each resolution with specialized state-space dynamics. By capturing both fine-grained, high-frequency patterns and coarse, global trends, MS-SSM enhances memory efficiency and long-range modeling. We further introduce an input-dependent scale-mixer, enabling dynamic information fusion across resolutions. The proposed approach significantly improves sequence modeling, particularly in long-range and hierarchical tasks, while maintaining computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, including Long Range Arena, hierarchical reasoning, time series classification, and image recognition, demonstrate that MS-SSM consistently outperforms prior SSM-based models, highlighting the benefits of multi-resolution processing in state-space architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff08MS-SSM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edfSSM\u6709\u6548\u5185\u5b58\u6709\u9650\u548c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6709\u6548\u5185\u5b58\u6709\u9650\u3001\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5927\u72b6\u6001\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6765\u6539\u5584\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6SSM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\u5e8f\u5217\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f7f\u7528\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u5904\u7406\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u8f93\u5165\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6df7\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728Long Range Arena\u3001\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMS-SSM\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u7684SSM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5904\u7406\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0cMS-SSM\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u9ad8\u9891\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u5168\u5c40\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel surface fitting algorithm that integrates contact stability while preserving geometric compatibility. Inspired by human grasping behavior, our method disentangles the grasp pose optimization into three sequential steps: (1) rotation optimization to align contact normals, (2) translation refinement to improve the alignment between the gripper frame origin and the object Center of Mass (CoM), and (3) gripper aperture adjustment to optimize contact point distribution. We validate our approach in simulation across 15 objects under both Known-shape (with clean CAD-derived dataset) and Observed-shape (with YCB object dataset) settings, including cross-platform grasp execution on three robot--gripper platforms. We further validate the method in real-world grasp experiments on a UR3e robot. Overall, DISF reduces CoM misalignment while maintaining geometric compatibility, translating into higher grasp success in both simulation and real-world execution compared to baselines.

Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bridge-TS\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63d2\u8865\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548cSchrodinger\u6865\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u7ebf\u6027\u63d2\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8d1f\u62c5\u589e\u52a0\u4e14\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650", "method": "1. \u4e13\u5bb6\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8fdb\u884c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u586b\u5145\u7f3a\u5931\u503c\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u7ed3\u679c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b2. \u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u5230\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7ec4\u5408\u5b83\u4eec\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec4\u5408\u5148\u9a8c\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u8fc7\u7a0b", "result": "\u5728ETT\u3001Exchange\u548cWeather\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cBridge-TS\u5728\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bb0\u5f55", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u5148\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0cBridge-TS\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u63d2\u8865\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u5148\u9a8c\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u63d2\u8865\u6027\u80fd"}}

Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise.

Identical observations may correspond to multiple valid behavior trajectories. The visuomotor policy must correctly extract the appropriate types and levels of information from the history to identify the current task phase. However, naively extending the history window is computationally expensive and may cause severe overfitting. Inspired by the continuous nature of human reasoning and the recoding of working memory, we introduce PAM, a novel visuomotor Policy equipped with Adaptive working Memory. With minimal additional training cost in a two-stage manner, PAM supports a 300-frame history window while maintaining high inference speed. Specifically, a hierarchical frame feature extractor yields two distinct representations for motion primitives and temporal disambiguation. For compact representation, a context router with range-specific queries is employed to produce compact context features across multiple history lengths. And an auxiliary objective of reconstructing historical information is introduced to ensure that the context router acts as an effective bottleneck. We meticulously design 7 tasks and verify that PAM can handle multiple scenarios of state ambiguity simultaneously. With a history window of approximately 10 seconds, PAM still supports stable training and maintains inference speeds above 20Hz.

To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time.

However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation.

Traditional graph-based planners excel at long-range pathfinding but lack reactivity, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods demonstrate strong collision avoidance but often fail to reach distant goals due to a lack of global context. We propose Hybrid Motion Planning with Deep Reinforcement Learning (HMP-DRL), a hybrid framework that bridges this gap. Our approach utilizes a graph-based global planner to generate a path, which is integrated into a local DRL policy via a sequence of checkpoints encoded in both the state space and reward function. To ensure social compliance, the local planner employs an entity-aware reward structure that dynamically adjusts safety margins and penalties based on the semantic type of surrounding agents. We validate the proposed method through extensive testing in a realistic simulation environment derived from real-world map data. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that HMP-DRL consistently outperforms other methods, including state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of key metrics of robot navigation: success rate, collision rate, and time to reach the goal.

Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have good ocular disease recognition results, they often ignore exploring the clinical pathology context and expert experience priors to improve ocular disease recognition performance and decision-making interpretability. To this end, we first develop a novel Pathology Recalibration Module (PRM) to leverage the potential of pathology context prior via the combination of the well-designed pixel-wise context compression operator and pathology distribution concentration operator; then this paper applies a novel expert prior Guidance Adapter (EPGA) to further highlight significant pixel-wise representation regions by fully mining the expert experience prior. By incorporating PRM and EPGA into the modern DNN, the PCRNet is constructed for automated ocular disease recognition. Additionally, we introduce an Integrated Loss (IL) to boost the ocular disease recognition performance of PCRNet by considering the effects of sample-wise loss distributions and training label frequencies. The extensive experiments on three ocular disease datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCRNet with IL over state-of-the-art attention-based networks and advanced loss methods.

Consequently, the ability of existing models to generalize across long-horizon bimanual tasks and mobile manipulation in unstructured environments remains limited. To bridge this gap, we present RoboMIND 2.0, a comprehensive real-world dataset comprising over 310K dual-arm manipulation trajectories collected across six distinct robot embodiments and 739 complex tasks. Crucially, to support research in contact-rich and spatially extended tasks, the dataset incorporates 12K tactile-enhanced episodes and 20K mobile manipulation trajectories.

However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization.

Meeting these conflicting requirements remains challenging, as satisfying this combination typically necessitates heavier actuators and bulkier transmission systems, significantly restricting the payload capacity of robot arms. In this letter, we present a lightweight anthropomorphic hand actuated by Bowden cables, which uniquely combines rolling-contact joint optimization with antagonistic cable actuation, enabling single-motor-per-joint control with negligible cable-length deviation. By relocating the actuator module to the torso, the design substantially reduces distal mass while maintaining anthropomorphic scale and dexterity. Additionally, this antagonistic cable actuation eliminates the need for synchronization between motors. Using the proposed methods, the hand assembly with a distal mass of 236g (excluding remote actuators and Bowden sheaths) demonstrated reliable execution of dexterous tasks, exceeding 18N fingertip force and lifting payloads over one hundred times its own mass.

To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline.

Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality.

Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks.

This arXiv version updates Figure 1 to include the concurrent work Qwen2.5-VL to ensure consistency with Table 1", "summary": "Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a \"grounding then answering with evidence referencing\" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response.

This paper proposes an informative trajectory planning approach, namely ReSPIRe, for SAT in unknown cluttered environments under considerably inaccurate prior target information and limited sensing field of view. We first develop a novel sigma point-based approximation approach to fast and accurately estimate mutual information reward under non-Gaussian belief distributions, utilizing informative sampling in state and observation spaces to mitigate the computational intractability of integral calculation. To tackle significant uncertainty associated with inadequate prior target information, we propose the hierarchical particle structure in ReSPIRe, which not only extracts critical particles for global route guidance, but also adjusts the particle number adaptively for planning efficiency. Building upon the hierarchical structure, we develop the reusable belief tree search approach to build a policy tree for online trajectory planning under uncertainty, which reuses rollout evaluation to improve planning efficiency.

While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Existing approaches either rely on shared environmental features or inertial assumptions or suffer from non-line-of-sight degradation and outliers in complex environments. Robust and efficient fusion of inter-robot measurements such as bearings, distances, and inertials for tens of robots remains challenging. We present CREPES-X (Cooperative RElative Pose Estimation System with multiple eXtended features), a hierarchical relative localization framework that enhances speed, accuracy, and robustness under challenging conditions, without requiring any global information. CREPES-X starts with a compact hardware design: InfraRed (IR) LEDs, an IR camera, an ultra-wideband module, and an IMU housed in a cube no larger than 6cm on each side. Then CREPES-X implements a two-stage hierarchical estimator to meet different requirements, considering speed, accuracy, and robustness. First, we propose a single-frame relative estimator that provides instant relative poses for multi-robot setups through a closed-form solution and robust bearing outlier rejection. Then a multi-frame relative estimator is designed to offer accurate and robust relative states by exploring IMU pre-integration via robocentric relative kinematics with loosely- and tightly-coupled optimization. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of CREPES-X, showing robustness to up to 90% bearing outliers, proving resilience in challenging conditions, and achieving RMSE of 0.073m and 1.817\u00b0 in real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "CREPES-X\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5171\u4eab\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u60ef\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6613\u53d7\u975e\u89c6\u8ddd\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e4b\u95f4\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u878d\u5408\u3002", "method": "CREPES-X\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1\uff09\u5355\u5e27\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u65b9\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5254\u9664\u63d0\u4f9b\u5373\u65f6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u59ff\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u5e27\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u901a\u8fc7IMU\u9884\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u677e\u8026\u5408/\u7d27\u8026\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u91c7\u7528IR LED\u3001IR\u76f8\u673a\u3001\u8d85\u5bbd\u5e26\u6a21\u5757\u548cIMU\u7684\u7d27\u51d1\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cCREPES-X\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684\u65b9\u4f4d\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b00.073\u7c73\u548c1.817\u00b0\u7684RMSE\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6311\u6218\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CREPES-X\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u76f8\u5bf9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u534f\u4f5c\u3002"}}

We introduce Stagewise Pairwise Mixers (SPM), a structured linear operator that replaces dense matrices with a composition of sparse pairwise-mixing stages. An SPM layer implements a global linear transformation in $O(nL)$ time with $O(nL)$ parameters, where $L$ is typically constant or $log_2n$, and admits exact closed-form forward and backward computations. SPM is designed as a drop-in replacement for dense linear layers in feedforward networks, recurrent architectures, attention mechanisms, etc. We derive complete forward and backward expressions for two parameterizations: an orthogonal norm-preserving rotation-based variant and a fully general $2 \\times 2$ mixing variant. Beyond computational savings, the stagewise structure of SPM induces an explicit compositional inductive bias that constrains model capacity and improves generalization when aligned with task structure.

Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts.

Submitted to the IEEE for possible publication", "summary": "Generating dynamic motions for legged robots remains a challenging problem. While reinforcement learning has achieved notable success in various legged locomotion tasks, producing highly dynamic behaviors often requires extensive reward tuning or high-quality demonstrations. Leveraging reduced-order models can help mitigate these challenges. However, the model discrepancy poses a significant challenge when transferring policies to full-body dynamics environments. In this work, we introduce a continuation-based learning framework that combines simplified model pretraining and model homotopy transfer to efficiently generate and refine complex dynamic behaviors. First, we pretrain the policy using a single rigid body model to capture core motion patterns in a simplified environment. Next, we employ a continuation strategy to progressively transfer the policy to the full-body environment, minimizing performance loss. To define the continuation path, we introduce a model homotopy from the single rigid body model to the full-body model by gradually redistributing mass and inertia between the trunk and legs. The proposed method not only achieves faster convergence but also demonstrates superior stability during the transfer process compared to baseline methods. Our framework is validated on a range of dynamic tasks, including flips and wall-assisted maneuvers, and is successfully deployed on a real quadrupedal robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u4f26\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u817f\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u6216\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u3002\u5229\u7528\u964d\u9636\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5168\u8eab\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u73af\u5883\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u521a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7b80\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6355\u83b7\u6838\u5fc3\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u9010\u6b65\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u5168\u8eab\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6e10\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u8eaf\u5e72\u548c\u817f\u90e8\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u60ef\u6027\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4ece\u5355\u521a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u5230\u5168\u8eab\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u8f6c\u79fb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7ffb\u8f6c\u548c\u5899\u58c1\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u52a8\uff09\u4e0a\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u6210\u529f\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u817f\u5f0f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose that these physical constraints shape dynamics to function not as limitations, but as a temporal inductive bias that breeds generalization. Through a phase-space analysis of signal propagation, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry: expansive dynamics amplify noise, whereas proper dissipative dynamics compress phase space that aligns with the network's spectral bias, compelling the abstraction of invariant features. This condition can be imposed externally via input encoding, or intrinsically through the network's own temporal dynamics. Both pathways require architectures capable of temporal integration and proper constraints to decode induced invariants, whereas static architectures fail to capitalize on temporal structure. Through comprehensive evaluations across supervised classification, unsupervised reconstruction, and zero-shot reinforcement learning, we demonstrate that a critical \"transition\" regime maximizes generalization capability.

Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks.

Many of these semantic constraints, such as yielding to emergency vehicles, complying with traffic officers' gestures, or stopping for school buses, are intuitive for humans yet difficult to encode explicitly. Although large vision-language models (VLMs) can interpret such semantics, their inference cost makes them impractical for real-time deployment.This work proposes LSRE, a Latent Semantic Rule Encoding framework that converts sparsely sampled VLM judgments into decision boundaries within the latent space of a recurrent world model. By encoding language-defined safety semantics into a lightweight latent classifier, LSRE enables real-time semantic risk assessment at 10 Hz without per-frame VLM queries. Experiments on six semantic-failure scenarios in CARLA demonstrate that LSRE attains semantic risk detection accuracy comparable to a large VLM baseline, while providing substantially earlier hazard anticipation and maintaining low computational latency. LSRE further generalizes to rarely seen semantic-similar test cases, indicating that language-guided latent classification offers an effective and deployable mechanism for semantic safety monitoring in autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "LSRE\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u7a00\u758f\u91c7\u6837\u7684VLM\u5224\u65ad\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9010\u5e27VLM\u67e5\u8be2", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u9075\u5b88\u590d\u6742\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u96be\u4ee5\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u800cVLM\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u90e8\u7f72", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5219\u7f16\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u8bed\u4e49\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b010Hz\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u5728CARLA\u76846\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u5931\u6548\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cLSRE\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5927\u578bVLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u98ce\u9669\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u65e9\u7684\u5371\u9669\u9884\u8b66\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bed\u4e49\u5b89\u5168\u76d1\u63a7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u7f55\u89c1\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6848\u4f8b"}}

In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making.

Task diversity and computational constraints require both effective architectures and efficient search methods. Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising alternative to computationally intensive Neural Architecture Search (NAS), but their application to architecture generation in computer vision has not been systematically studied, particularly regarding prompt engineering and validation strategies. Building on the task-agnostic NNGPT/LEMUR framework, this work introduces and validates two key contributions for computer vision. First, we present Few-Shot Architecture Prompting (FSAP), the first systematic study of the number of supporting examples (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) for LLM-based architecture generation. We find that using n = 3 examples best balances architectural diversity and context focus for vision tasks. Second, we introduce Whitespace-Normalized Hash Validation, a lightweight deduplication method (less than 1 ms) that provides a 100x speedup over AST parsing and prevents redundant training of duplicate computer vision architectures. In large-scale experiments across seven computer vision benchmarks (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, CelebA, ImageNette, SVHN, Places365), we generated 1,900 unique architectures. We also introduce a dataset-balanced evaluation methodology to address the challenge of comparing architectures across heterogeneous vision tasks.

This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$\u03bc$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability.

By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\\mathsf p_{\\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\\sqrt{\\mathsf p_{\\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bb6\u65cf\uff1a\u5e7f\u4e49\u5bf9\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eGCA\u635f\u5931\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e73\u8861\u635f\u5931\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u901a\u5e38\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u635f\u5931\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GLA\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5e7f\u4e49\u5bf9\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u635f\u5931\uff09\u548cGCA\u635f\u5931\uff08\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u611f\u77e5\u52a0\u6743\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eGLA\u635f\u5931\u662f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\uff0c\u4f46H\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u65e0\u754c\u5047\u8bbe\u96c6\uff1bGCA\u635f\u5931\u5bf9\u4efb\u4f55\u5047\u8bbe\u96c6\u90fd\u5177\u6709H\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u4e24\u79cd\u635f\u5931\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cGLA\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7565\u597d\uff0cGCA\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u7565\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "GCA\u635f\u5931\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u90fd\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity.

By separating the state changes from the actuators that realize those changes, Dream2Flow overcomes the embodiment gap and enables zero-shot guidance from pre-trained video models to manipulate objects of diverse categories-including rigid, articulated, deformable, and granular. Through trajectory optimization or reinforcement learning, Dream2Flow converts reconstructed 3D object flow into executable low-level commands without task-specific demonstrations.

Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy.

Existing approaches for inferring articulation mechanisms from static observations are prone to visual ambiguity, while methods that estimate parameters from state changes typically rely on constrained settings such as fixed cameras and unobstructed views. Furthermore, fine-grained functional elements like small handles are frequently missed by general object detectors. To bridge this gap, we present ArtiSG, a framework that constructs functional 3D scene graphs by encoding human demonstrations into structured robotic memory. Our approach leverages a robust articulation data collection pipeline utilizing a portable setup to accurately estimate 6-DoF articulation trajectories and axes even under camera ego-motion.

With this in mind, we propose Bayesian Self-Distillation (BSD), a principled method for constructing sample-specific target distributions via Bayesian inference using the model's own predictions. Unlike existing approaches, BSD does not rely on hard targets after initialization.

The wide-populated obstacles in realistic workspaces further complicate DLO manipulation, necessitating efficient deformation planning and robust deformation tracking. In this work, we propose a novel framework for DLO manipulation in constrained environments. This framework combines hierarchical deformation planning with neural tracking, ensuring reliable performance in both global deformation synthesis and local deformation tracking. Specifically, the deformation planner begins by generating a spatial path set that inherently satisfies the homotopic constraints associated with DLO keypoint paths.

Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.\n  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.\n  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling.

Our teleoperation design decomposes humanoid control into intuitive submodules, which include hand-eye coordination, grasp primitives, arm end-effector tracking, and locomotion. This modularity allows us to collect high-quality demonstrations efficiently. Building on this, we introduce Choice Policy, an imitation learning approach that generates multiple candidate actions and learns to score them. This architecture enables both fast inference and effective modeling of multimodal behaviors. We validate our approach on two real-world tasks: dishwasher loading and whole-body loco-manipulation for whiteboard wiping.

This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4ece\u5bf9\u8bdd\u52a9\u624b\u5411\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f6c\u53d8\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u64cd\u4f5c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u538b\u60c5\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f20\u8f93\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6297\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u5236\u5b9a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u8bae\u7a0b\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd0\u7b79\u5b66\u89d2\u8272\u4ece\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5411\u62a4\u680f\u518d\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u5e08\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u8d1f\u8d23\u63a7\u5236\u903b\u8f91\u3001\u6fc0\u52b1\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u76d1\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u654f\u611f\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u4fdd\u8bc1\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8981\u7d20\u548c\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u660e\u786e\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u5c3e\u90e8\u98ce\u9669\u7eaa\u5f8b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u5d4c\u5165\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807ERPM\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u57fa\u4e8e\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5982\u5e94\u529b\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u540d\u7684\u90bb\u57df\u6807\u51c6\u6216\u5c40\u90e8Procrustes\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u71b5\u79e9\u4fdd\u7559\u5ea6\u91cf(ERPM)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u77e9\u9635\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u8c31\u7684\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u79e9\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u539f\u59cb\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5176\u964d\u7ef4\u6295\u5f71\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684MRRE\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u51e0\u4f55\u7684Local Procrustes\u6bd4\u8f83\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6807\u51c6\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8c31\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f88\u4f4e\uff0c\u800cERPM\u4e0eLocal Procrustes\u5e73\u5747\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f3a\u4f46\u5c40\u90e8\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "ERPM\u80fd\u591f\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5d4c\u5165\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u654f\u611f\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6307\u6807\u6784\u5efa\u3002"}}

However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines.

Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "CLEAR-HUG\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u6349\u5fc3\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec6\u5fae\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u9075\u5faa\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u8de8\u5bfc\u8054\u548c\u5fc3\u8df3\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5fc3\u810f\u4f20\u5bfc\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8df3\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u9075\u5faa\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u63d0\u51faCLEAR\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u53f7\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5fc3\u8df3\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u5171\u6027\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1HUG\u8bca\u65ad\u5934\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4e34\u5e8a\u4ece\u5355\u5fc3\u8df3\u5230\u5355\u5bfc\u8054\u518d\u5230\u5bfc\u8054\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53476.84%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u589e\u5f3a\u5fc3\u810f\u4f20\u5bfc\u8868\u793a\u548c\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u5357\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "CLEAR-HUG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5fc3\u810f\u4f20\u5bfc\u53d8\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u6d41\u7a0b\u6a21\u62df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Potato yield can be estimated on harvesters using RGB-D cameras, which capture three-dimensional (3D) information of individual tubers moving along the conveyor belt. However, point clouds reconstructed from RGB-D images are incomplete due to self-occlusion, leading to systematic underestimation of tuber weight. To address this, we introduce PointRAFT, a high-throughput point cloud regression network that directly predicts continuous 3D shape properties, such as tuber weight, from partial point clouds. Rather than reconstructing full 3D geometry, PointRAFT infers target values directly from raw 3D data. Its key architectural novelty is an object height embedding that incorporates tuber height as an additional geometric cue, improving weight prediction under practical harvesting conditions. PointRAFT was trained and evaluated on 26,688 partial point clouds collected from 859 potato tubers across four cultivars and three growing seasons on an operational harvester in Japan. On a test set of 5,254 point clouds from 172 tubers, PointRAFT achieved a mean absolute error of 12.0 g and a root mean squared error of 17.2 g, substantially outperforming a linear regression baseline and a standard PointNet++ regression network. With an average inference time of 6.3 ms per point cloud, PointRAFT supports processing rates of up to 150 tubers per second, meeting the high-throughput requirements of commercial potato harvesters.

Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios.

However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively.

Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f66\u8f7d\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u3001LiDAR\u7b49\u4e0d\u540c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u6574\u5408\u8d77\u6765\u4ee5\u521b\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5e73\u53f0\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8fdb\u5c55\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u8d21\u732e\u662f\u5236\u5b9a\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u5230\u5b66\u4e60\u6574\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u6db5\u76d6\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7ebf\u5230\u590d\u6742\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u59823D\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5360\u7528\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8fd8\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5360\u7528\u8868\u793a\u7684\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8def\u7ebf\u56fe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u3002"}}

The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03(SFT)\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60(RL)\u8c03\u4f18\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0RL\u8c03\u4f18\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91caSFT\u548cRL\u8c03\u4f18\u5728LLM\u6cdb\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u548c\u6f14\u53d8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u679a\u4e3e\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u7b49\u539f\u5b50\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b49\u4f4e\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u63a2\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "RL\u8c03\u4f18\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u62b5\u6297\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff1bSFT\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u660e\u663e\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u8868\u9762\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u672c\u8d28\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7a33\u5065\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

This challenge arises when there is a significant disparity in the number of images belonging to a particular class, such as the presence or absence of a specific disease, as compared to the number of images belonging to other classes. This issue is especially notable during pandemics, which may result in an even more significant imbalance in the dataset. Researchers have employed various approaches in recent years to detect COVID-19 infected individuals accurately and quickly, with artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms at the forefront. However, the lack of sufficient and balanced data remains a significant obstacle to these methods. This study addresses the challenge by proposing a progressive generative adversarial network to generate synthetic data to supplement the real ones. The proposed method suggests a weighted approach to combine synthetic data with real ones before inputting it into a deep network classifier. A multi-objective meta-heuristic population-based optimization algorithm is employed to optimize the hyper-parameters of the classifier. The proposed model exhibits superior cross-validated metrics compared to existing methods when applied to a large and imbalanced chest X-ray image dataset of COVID-19. The proposed model achieves 95.5% and 98.5% accuracy for 4-class and 2-class imbalanced classification problems, respectively.

Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association.

As a critical hyperparameter for DFL, the mixing matrix controls both the convergence rate and the needs of agent-to-agent communications, and has thus been studied extensively. However, existing designs mostly focused on minimizing the communication time, leaving open the minimization of per-node energy consumption that is critical for energy-constrained devices. This work addresses this gap through a theoretically-justified solution for mixing matrix design that aims at minimizing the maximum per-node energy consumption until convergence, while taking into account the broadcast nature of wireless communications. Based on a novel convergence theorem that allows arbitrarily time-varying mixing matrices, we propose a multi-phase design framework that activates time-varying communication topologies under optimized budgets to trade off the per-iteration energy consumption and the convergence rate while balancing the energy consumption across nodes. Our evaluations based on real data have validated the efficacy of the proposed solution in combining the low energy consumption of sparse mixing matrices and the fast convergence of dense mixing matrices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5206\u6563\u5f0f\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6700\u5927\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u65e0\u7ebf\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u5e7f\u64ad\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42\u2014\u2014\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u8282\u70b9\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5141\u8bb8\u4efb\u610f\u65f6\u53d8\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65b0\u6536\u655b\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u9884\u7b97\u6fc0\u6d3b\u65f6\u53d8\u901a\u4fe1\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u5728\u6bcf\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u8282\u70b9\u95f4\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u5bc6\u96c6\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u77e9\u9635\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u80fd\u91cf\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u65e0\u7ebf\u8bbe\u5907\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere\" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks.

Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities.

A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s.

While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\u03bb$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems.

Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling.

Current state-of-the-art FER models tend to have weak generalization when tested on diverse data, leading to deteriorated performance in the real world and hindering FER as a research domain. Though researchers have proposed complex architectures to address this generalization issue, they require training cross-domain to obtain generalizable results, which is inherently contradictory for real-world application. Our model, MotivNet, achieves competitive performance across datasets without cross-domain training by using Meta-Sapiens as a backbone. Sapiens is a human vision foundational model with state-of-the-art generalization in the real world through large-scale pretraining of a Masked Autoencoder. We propose MotivNet as an additional downstream task for Sapiens and define three criteria to evaluate MotivNet's viability as a Sapiens task: benchmark performance, model similarity, and data similarity. Throughout this paper, we describe the components of MotivNet, our training approach, and our results showing MotivNet is generalizable across domains. We demonstrate that MotivNet can be benchmarked against existing SOTA models and meets the listed criteria, validating MotivNet as a Sapiens downstream task, and making FER more incentivizing for in-the-wild application.

Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models.

While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "MambaSeg\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u878d\u5408\u3002", "motivation": "RGB\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u548c\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u989c\u8272\u7eb9\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6d41\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652fMamba\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406RGB\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u5757\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728DDD17\u548cDSEC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMambaSeg\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "MambaSeg\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance.

Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to \"regression-to-the-mean\", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

Project: https://tinnerhrhe.github.io/gardo_project", "summary": "Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "GARDO\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u5f0f\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ebfRL\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4ee3\u7406\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGARDO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316-\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6837\u672c\u65bd\u52a0\u60e9\u7f5a\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316-\u5b9a\u671f\u66f4\u65b0\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u6837\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u4f18\u5316-\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4e14\u9ad8\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7ed9\u4e88\u989d\u5916\u5956\u52b1\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u4ee3\u7406\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGARDO\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GARDO\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6fc0\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7f13\u89e3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability.

Although exact distribution-free conditional coverage is impossible with finite samples, recent work has focused on improving the conditional coverage of standard conformal procedures. Distinct from approaches that target relaxed notions of conditional coverage, we directly minimize the mean squared error of conditional coverage by refining the quantile regression components that underpin many conformal methods. Leveraging a Taylor expansion, we derive a sharp surrogate objective for quantile regression: a density-weighted pinball loss, where the weights are given by the conditional density of the conformity score evaluated at the true quantile.

While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360\u00b0 closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360\u00b0 panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5168\u666f\u62fc\u63a5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c062D\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a3D\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u5c40\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u8ddd\u5706\u67f1\u6295\u5f71\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684360\u00b0\u5168\u666f\u56fe\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u67423D\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u5f71\u548c\u626d\u66f2\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u62fc\u63a5\u6280\u672f\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u5355\u5e94\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u53d8\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5177\u6709\u591a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5c42\u548c\u906e\u6321\u7684\u771f\u5b9e3D\u573a\u666f\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u5728\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u5f71\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5f2f\u66f2\u548c\u62c9\u4f38\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c360\u00b0\u95ed\u73af\u62fc\u63a5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u95ee\u9898\u66f4\u52a0\u4e25\u91cd\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e2d\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u70b9\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u878d\u5408\uff1b2. \u57283D\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u7edf\u4e00\u6295\u5f71\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b49\u8ddd\u5706\u67f1\u6295\u5f71\u5c06\u878d\u5408\u6570\u636e\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5168\u666f\u6d41\u5f62\uff1b3. \u5728\u753b\u5e03\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u6d1e\u586b\u5145\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u70b9\u8f6c\u6362\u63ed\u793a\u7684\u672a\u77e5\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u663e\u8457\u89c6\u5dee\u548c\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u5931\u771f\u548c\u91cd\u5f71\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u66f4\u81ea\u7136\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5168\u666f\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u62fc\u63a5\u4ece2D\u53d8\u5f62\u8303\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u6982\u5ff5\u5316\u4e3a3D\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7075\u6d3b\u6574\u5408\u5404\u79cd3D\u63d0\u5347\u548c\u8865\u5168\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u67423D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5168\u666f\u62fc\u63a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains.

Here we present EndoRare, a one-shot, retraining-free generative framework that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity lesion exemplars from a single reference image. By leveraging language-guided concept disentanglement, EndoRare separates pathognomonic lesion features from non-diagnostic attributes, encoding the former into a learnable prototype embedding while varying the latter to ensure diversity. We validated the framework across four rare pathologies (calcifying fibrous tumor, juvenile polyposis syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome). Synthetic images were judged clinically plausible by experts and, when used for data augmentation, significantly enhanced downstream AI classifiers, improving the true positive rate at low false-positive rates.

However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8eVlasov-Poisson-Landau\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b\u5bf9\u5fae\u89c2\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u76f8\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u521a\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u9879\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8bef\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fVPL\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8eVPFP\u548cEP\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5ec9\u4ef7\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u5fae\u5b8f\u89c2\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5f20\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u6e10\u8fd1\u4fdd\u6301\u7684SPINN\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6837\u672c\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VPL\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u79bb\u5b50\u4f53\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684UQ\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing.

The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements.

Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the \"multi-source representation beam semantics\" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u6848SaM2B\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6216\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u65f6\u523b\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u968f\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u5267\u70c8\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5f31\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f1a\u524a\u5f31\u8de8\u573a\u666f\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSaM2B\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73af\u5883\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u98de\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u6ce2\u675f\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\"\u591a\u6e90\u8868\u793a\u6ce2\u675f\u8bed\u4e49\"\u5bf9\u9f50\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4e\u7a7a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSaM2B\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u6ee1\u610f\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "SaM2B\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce2\u675f\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions.

Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty.

They fail to exhibit the human-like proficiency required to seamlessly interleave dynamic tool manipulation with continuous reasoning, particularly in knowledge-intensive and visually complex scenarios that demand coordinated external tools such as search and image cropping. In this work, we introduce SenseNova-MARS, a novel Multimodal Agentic Reasoning and Search framework that empowers VLMs with interleaved visual reasoning and tool-use capabilities via reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, SenseNova-MARS dynamically integrates the image search, text search, and image crop tools to tackle fine-grained and knowledge-intensive visual understanding challenges. In the RL stage, we propose the Batch-Normalized Group Sequence Policy Optimization (BN-GSPO) algorithm to improve the training stability and advance the model's ability to invoke tools and reason effectively. To comprehensively evaluate the agentic VLMs on complex visual tasks, we introduce the HR-MMSearch benchmark, the first search-oriented benchmark composed of high-resolution images with knowledge-intensive and search-driven questions. Experiments demonstrate that SenseNova-MARS achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-source search and fine-grained image understanding benchmarks. Specifically, on search-oriented benchmarks, SenseNova-MARS-8B scores 67.84 on MMSearch and 41.64 on HR-MMSearch, surpassing proprietary models such as Gemini-3-Flash and GPT-5.

Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency.

Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \\times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $\u03a3$ and gradient components $\\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation.

While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm.

To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783).

Comprehensive experimental validation in application-specific settings is deferred to a companion experimental study", "summary": "Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u504f\u5dee\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6162\u6216\u9002\u5e94\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u504f\u5dee-\u566a\u58f0-\u5bf9\u9f50\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u8ba1\u7b97\u635f\u5931\u6216\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u8bca\u65ad\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u76d1\u7763\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u8c03\u8282\u7684actor-critic\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u8bca\u65ad\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u754c\u6709\u6548\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7actor-critic\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8bca\u65ad\u56fe\u793a\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u4fe1\u53f7\u5982\u4f55\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u5e8f\u5dee\u5206\u8bef\u5dee\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u9002\u5e94\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c06\u8bef\u5dee\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e00\u7b49\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u77ed\u671f\u65f6\u95f4\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u6ede\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6b65\u8f68\u8ff9\u6bb5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5355\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u5305\u542b\u672a\u89e3\u6790\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u800c\u975e\u5e95\u5c42\u52a8\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u9884\u6d4b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u6ede\u540e\u7cfb\u7edf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6982\u7387\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fb9\u7f18\u5316\u83b7\u5f97\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6307\u6807\uff08\u96c6\u5408\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u77ed\u65f6\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u7d2f\u79efWasserstein\u6f02\u79fb\uff09\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u6df7\u6c8c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08Lorenz-63\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cKuramoto-Sivashinsky\u65b9\u7a0b\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6761\u4ef6\u5355\u6b65\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u77ed\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u6280\u80fd\u3001\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u957f\u671f\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5b8c\u5168\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6355\u6349\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.\n  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.", "AI": {"tldr": "RedunCut\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u9009\u62e9\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u548c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c1114-62%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6d4b\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6027\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9053\u8def\u8f66\u8f86\u3001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u76d1\u63a7\u89c6\u9891\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0cRedunCut\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c14-62%\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6f02\u79fb\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "RedunCut\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709DMSS\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder.

Rethinking Proxy-Model Practice", "comment": null, "summary": "Data teams at frontier AI companies routinely train small proxy models to make critical decisions about pretraining data recipes for full-scale training runs. However, the community has a limited understanding of whether and when conclusions drawn from small-scale experiments reliably transfer to full-scale model training. In this work, we uncover a subtle yet critical issue in the standard experimental protocol for data recipe assessment: the use of identical small-scale model training configurations across all data recipes in the name of \"fair\" comparison. We show that the experiment conclusions about data quality can flip with even minor adjustments to training hyperparameters, as the optimal training configuration is inherently data-dependent. Moreover, this fixed-configuration protocol diverges from full-scale model development pipelines, where hyperparameter optimization is a standard step. Consequently, we posit that the objective of data recipe assessment should be to identify the recipe that yields the best performance under data-specific tuning. To mitigate the high cost of hyperparameter tuning, we introduce a simple patch to the evaluation protocol: using reduced learning rates for proxy model training. We show that this approach yields relative performance that strongly correlates with that of fully tuned large-scale LLM pretraining runs. Theoretically, we prove that for random-feature models, this approach preserves the ordering of datasets according to their optimal achievable loss. Empirically, we validate this approach across 23 data recipes covering four critical dimensions of data curation, demonstrating dramatic improvements in the reliability of small-scale experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u534f\u8bae\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u6765\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u662f\u6570\u636e\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u5168\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u66f4\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u516c\u53f8\u4f7f\u7528\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u4f46\u793e\u533a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5168\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\"\u516c\u5e73\"\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7ed3\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u5728\u4ee3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u968f\u673a\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6309\u6700\u4f18\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u635f\u5931\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6db5\u76d6\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5c55\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u768423\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u5168\u89c4\u6a21LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6570\u636e\u914d\u65b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u914d\u65b9\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects.

However, BPTT requires storing the history of all states in the network and then replaying them sequentially backwards in time. This computation appears extremely implausible for the brain to implement. Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) proposes an mathematically equivalent alternative where gradient information is propagated forwards in time locally alongside the regular forward pass, however it has significantly greater computational complexity than BPTT which renders it impractical for large networks. E-prop proposes an approximation of RTRL which reduces its complexity to the level of BPTT while maintaining a purely online forward update which can be implemented by an eligibility trace at each synapse. However, works on RTRL and E-prop ubiquitously investigate learning in a single layer with recurrent dynamics. However, learning in the brain spans multiple layers and consists of both hierarchal dynamics in depth as well as time. In this mathematical note, we extend the E-prop framework to handle arbitrarily deep networks, deriving a novel recursion relationship across depth which extends the eligibility traces of E-prop to deeper layers. Our results thus demonstrate an online learning algorithm can perform accurate credit assignment across both time and depth simultaneously, allowing the training of deep recurrent networks without backpropagation through time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86E-prop\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06E-prop\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u8ff9\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u8de8\u8d8a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684RTRL\u548cE-prop\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u5faa\u73af\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u8111\u5b66\u4e60\u8de8\u8d8a\u591a\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u52a8\u6001\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u8de8\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u9012\u5f52\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06E-prop\u7684\u8d44\u683c\u8ff9\u673a\u5236\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6df1\u5c42\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u8d8a\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels.

However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08F2IDiff FM\uff09\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff08SISR\uff09\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528DINOv2\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fLR\u56fe\u50cf\u9700\u8981\u65e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08T2IDiff FM\uff09\u7684SISR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec6\u5fae\u7eb9\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5927\u5c3a\u5bf8LR\u56fe\u50cf\u9700\u5206\u5757\u5904\u7406\u5bfc\u81f4\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u5e0c\u671b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528DINOv2\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7279\u5f81\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08F2IDiff FM\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u4e14\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771fLR\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u65e0\u5e7b\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684SISR\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\u7684F2IDiff FM\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u624b\u673a\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9002\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfT2IDiff FM\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u6444\u5f71\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCPR\uff08\u56e0\u679c\u751f\u7406\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5fc3\u7535\u56fe\uff08ECG\uff09\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7f20\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ECG\u8bca\u65ad\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5e73\u6ed1\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6270\u52a8\uff08SAP\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u5f15\u5165\u663e\u8457\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e34\u5e8a\u76d1\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6839\u6e90\u5728\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u975e\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u4f2a\u76f8\u5173\u800c\u975e\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u7f20\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u751f\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCM\uff09\u5efa\u6a21ECG\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u65bd\u7ed3\u6784\u5e72\u9884\u4ee5\u4e25\u683c\u5206\u79bb\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u5f62\u6001\uff08P-QRS-T\u590d\u5408\u6ce2\uff09\u4e0e\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u4f2a\u5f71\u3002", "result": "\u5728PTB-XL\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCPR\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728SAP\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\uff0cCPR\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u52300.632\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e2d\u503c\u5e73\u6ed1\uff080.541 F1\uff09\u63d0\u53479.1%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "CPR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709ECG\u8bca\u65ad\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65f6\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports.

While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM.

However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix.

Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

We developed a novel computational infrastructure to address the data integration challenge, reducing processing time from a projected over 100 days to 3.2 hours through byte-offset indexing architecture, a 740-fold improvement. Our comprehensive analysis revealed critical insights into the multivariate nature of lipophilicity: while molecular weight exhibited weak bivariate correlation with logP, SHAP analysis on ensemble models identified it as the single most important predictor globally. We systematically evaluated multiple modeling approaches, discovering that linear models suffered from inherent heteroskedasticity that classical remediation strategies, including weighted least squares and Box-Cox transformation, failed to address. Tree-based ensemble methods, including Random Forest and XGBoost, proved inherently robust to this violation, achieving an R-squared of 0.765 and RMSE of 0.731 logP units on the test set. Furthermore, a stratified modeling strategy, employing specialized models for drug-like molecules (91 percent of dataset) and extreme cases (nine percent), achieved optimal performance: an RMSE of 0.838 for the drug-like subset and an R-squared of 0.767 for extreme molecules, the highest of all evaluated approaches. These findings provide actionable guidance for molecular design, establish robust baselines for lipophilicity prediction using only 2D descriptors, and demonstrate that well-curated, descriptor-based ensemble models remain competitive with state-of-the-art graph neural network architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21logP\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6765\u81eaPubChem\u3001ChEMBL\u548ceMolecules\u4e09\u4e2a\u6743\u5a01\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u7684426850\u4e2a\u751f\u7269\u6d3b\u6027\u5316\u5408\u7269\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b57\u8282\u504f\u79fb\u7d22\u5f15\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece100\u591a\u5929\u7f29\u77ed\u52303.2\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86740\u500d\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5316\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u6574\u5408\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u9760\u7684logP\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u57fa\u4e8e\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5b57\u8282\u504f\u79fb\u7d22\u5f15\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6574\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u3001XGBoost\uff09\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4e3a\u7c7b\u836f\u5206\u5b50\uff0891%\uff09\u548c\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\uff089%\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e13\u95e8\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230R\u5e73\u65b90.765\u548cRMSE 0.731 logP\u5355\u4f4d\uff1b\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u7c7b\u836f\u5206\u5b50\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0aRMSE\u4e3a0.838\uff0c\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u5206\u5b50\u4e0aR\u5e73\u65b9\u4e3a0.767\uff0c\u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5206\u5b50\u91cd\u91cf\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u9884\u6d4b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u57fa\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4eb2\u8102\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u67b6\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u6027\u5177\u6709\u5929\u7136\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5206\u5c42\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u6574\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u7684\u4eb2\u8102\u6027\u9884\u6d4b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD.

Consequently, they fail to reflect the complexity of real-world conditions, such as changes in illumination, weather, etc., that are critical to evaluating model robustness and generalization in safety-critical applications. To address these limitations, we present RGBT-Ground, the first large-scale visual grounding benchmark built for complex real-world scenarios. It consists of spatially aligned RGB and Thermal infrared (TIR) image pairs with high-quality referring expressions, corresponding object bounding boxes, and fine-grained annotations at the scene, environment, and object levels. This benchmark enables comprehensive evaluation and facilitates the study of robust grounding under diverse and challenging conditions. Furthermore, we establish a unified visual grounding framework that supports both uni-modal (RGB or TIR) and multi-modal (RGB-TIR) visual inputs. Based on it, we propose RGBT-VGNet, a simple yet effective baseline for fusing complementary visual modalities to achieve robust grounding. We conduct extensive adaptations to the existing methods on RGBT-Ground.

However, its performance often degrades significantly due to limited connectivity and data heterogeneity. As we move toward the next generation of wireless networks, mobility is increasingly embedded in many real-world applications. The user mobility, either natural or induced, enables clients to act as relays or bridges, thus enhancing information flow in sparse networks; however, its impact on DFL has been largely overlooked despite its potential. In this work, we systematically investigate the role of mobility in improving DFL performance. We first establish the convergence of DFL in sparse networks under user mobility and theoretically demonstrate that even random movement of a fraction of users can significantly boost performance. Building upon this insight, we propose a DFL framework that utilizes mobile users with induced mobility patterns, allowing them to exploit the knowledge of data distribution to determine their trajectories to enhance information propagation through the network. Through extensive experiments, we empirically confirm our theoretical findings, validate the superiority of our approach over baselines, and provide a comprehensive analysis of how various network parameters influence DFL performance in mobile networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7684DFL\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DFL\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800c\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\uff08\u81ea\u7136\u6216\u8bf1\u5bfc\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u65e0\u7ebf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5176\u6f5c\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u79fb\u52a8\u73af\u5883\u4e0bDFL\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u8bf1\u5bfc\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684DFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u79fb\u52a8\u7528\u6237\u6839\u636e\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u786e\u5b9a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u90e8\u5206\u7528\u6237\u7684\u968f\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u4e5f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7528\u6237\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u662f\u63d0\u5347DFL\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u79fb\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u7f51\u7edc\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u52a8\u3002"}}

A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset.

In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory.

Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices.

This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.\n  We propose \\textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.\n  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees.

However, the nature of transfer, its transitive-intransitive nature, is still an open problem, and negative transfer remains a significant obstacle. Selection of beneficial auxiliary task sets in multi-task learning is frequently hindered by the high computational cost of their evaluation, the high number of plausible candidate auxiliary sets, and the varying complexity of selection across target tasks.\n  To address these constraints, we introduce BandiK, a novel three-stage multi-task auxiliary task subset selection method using multi-bandits, where each arm pull evaluates candidate auxiliary sets by training and testing a multiple output neural network on a single random train-test dataset split. Firstly, BandiK estimates the pairwise transfers between tasks, which helps in identifying which tasks are likely to benefit from joint learning. In the second stage, it constructs a linear number of candidate sets of auxiliary tasks (in the number of all tasks) for each target task based on the initial estimations, significantly reducing the exponential number of potential auxiliary task sets. Thirdly, it employs a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework for each task, where the arms correspond to the performance of candidate auxiliary sets realized as multiple output neural networks over train-test data set splits. To enhance efficiency, BandiK integrates these individual task-specific MABs into a multi-bandit structure. The proposed multi-bandit solution exploits that the same neural network realizes multiple arms of different individual bandits corresponding to a given candidate set. This semi-overlapping arm property defines a novel multi-bandit cost/reward structure utilized in BandiK.", "AI": {"tldr": "BandiK\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9ad8\u6548\u9009\u62e9\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u969c\u788d\u3002\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u6570\u91cf\u5e9e\u5927\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u4f30\u8ba1\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u8fc1\u79fb\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u521d\u59cb\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6784\u5efa\u7ebf\u6027\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u5019\u9009\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\uff1b3) \u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8001\u864e\u673a\u7ed3\u6784\u5229\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u4e2a\u8001\u864e\u673a\u81c2\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "BandiK\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5019\u9009\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u7684\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u591a\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "BandiK\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8fc1\u79fb\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u5171\u4eab\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM.

We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA.

However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \\times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u526a\u679d\u548c\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f6f\u786c\u4ef6\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728FPGA\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u751f\u6210\u52a0\u901f\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5de8\u5927\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528N:M\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u548c4\u4f4d\u6574\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u53cd\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u5305\u62ecCPU\u3001NVIDIA GPU\u548c\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49FPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u57284096\u00d74096\u77e9\u9635\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ed3\u54082:4\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u5b58\u50a8\u51cf\u5c114\u500d\uff0c\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.71\u500d\uff0c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e1.29\u500d\u3002LLaMA-7B\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.36\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6N:M\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800cFPGA\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u4e3a\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u67b6\u6784\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments.

In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization.

We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users.

However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\\partial L / \\partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u5177\u6709log-sum-exp\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u4ef7\u4e8e\u6267\u884c\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u91ca\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6982\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u8f6f\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u539f\u578b\u7279\u5316\u548c\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff09\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u677e\u6563\u7c7b\u6bd4\u6216\u4e8b\u540e\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5177\u6709log-sum-exp\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6216\u80fd\u91cf\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u2202L/\u2202d_j\u6070\u597d\u7b49\u4e8e\u5bf9\u5e94\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u8d1f\u540e\u9a8c\u8d23\u4efb-r_j\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ee3\u6570\u6052\u7b49\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "result": "\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u9690\u5f0f\u6267\u884c\u671f\u671b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8d23\u4efb\u4e0d\u662f\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u53d8\u91cf\u800c\u662f\u9700\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u5c31\u5d4c\u5165\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u5c06\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u6df7\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u5206\u7c7b\u4e09\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u7edf\u4e00\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff0c\u8868\u660etransformer\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u662f\u6d8c\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\u800c\u662f\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named \"FireRescue\" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u591a\u573a\u666f\u7684FireRescue\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faFRS-YOLO\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7ef4\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u5f3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5c71\u533a\u6216\u68ee\u6797\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u5bf9\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u590d\u6742\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7c7b\u522b\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8986\u76d6\u6d88\u9632\u8f66\u3001\u6d88\u9632\u5458\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efaFireRescue\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u57ce\u5e02\u3001\u5c71\u533a\u3001\u68ee\u6797\u548c\u6c34\u57df\u7b49\u591a\u573a\u666f\uff0c8\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u517115,980\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c32,000\u4e2a\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51faFRS-YOLO\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u7ef4\u534f\u4f5c\u589e\u5f3a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u95f4\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u589e\u5f3a\u524d\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u70df\u96fe\u906e\u6321\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86YOLO\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d88\u9632\u6551\u63f4\u6307\u6325\u51b3\u7b56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5411\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u52a0\u901f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u91c7\u7528\u987a\u5e8f\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9token\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u7279\u6027\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5149\u6805\u626b\u63cf\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u4e2d\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f84\u5411\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u9009\u62e9\u521d\u59cbtoken\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d77\u70b9\uff0c\u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5176\u4ed6token\u6309\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5206\u7ec4\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u540c\u5fc3\u73af\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u5185\u5230\u5916\u6309\u73af\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u5d4c\u5957\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u4fee\u6b63\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "RadAR\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7ed3\u6784\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u8d2f\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f84\u5411\u5e76\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u4fee\u6b63\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0cRadAR\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Its core innovation includes learnable edge gates for optimization-stage topology modification and intelligent proposals based on physical quantities like node tension measuring local stress and edge information flow quantifying connectivity importance. Starting from low-complexity coarse scales and refining to finer ones, RGTN finds compact structures while escaping local minima via scale-induced perturbations.

Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results.

Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass \"generate-then-segment\" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a \"Generate-Evaluate-Evolve\" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \\textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \\textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u548cFermat\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u5ff5\u6765\u53d1\u73b0\u5f3a\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u968f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u534f\u8c03\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7279\u522b\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u727a\u7272\u534f\u8c03\u6027\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u677e\u6563\u8026\u5408\u6216\u5b8c\u5168\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u72b6\u6001\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\u538b\u7f29\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u534f\u8c03\u6240\u9700\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2. \u5f15\u5165Fermat\u72b6\u6001\u6982\u5ff5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u56e2\u961f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u865a\u6784\u72b6\u6001\uff1b3. \u5b9a\u4e49spreadness\u5ea6\u91cf\u56e2\u961f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff1b4. \u4f7f\u7528\u795e\u7ecf\u56fe\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63d0\u53d6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9886\u57df\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u72b6\u6001\u540c\u6b65\u6a21\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9009\u9879\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Accordingly, we propose FlowBlending, a stage-aware multi-model sampling strategy that employs a large model and a small model at capacity-sensitive stages and intermediate stages, respectively. We further introduce simple criteria to choose stage boundaries and provide a velocity-divergence analysis as an effective proxy for identifying capacity-sensitive regions. Across LTX-Video (2B/13B) and WAN 2.1 (1.3B/14B), FlowBlending achieves up to 1.65x faster inference with 57.35% fewer FLOPs, while maintaining the visual fidelity, temporal coherence, and semantic alignment of the large models.

We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data.

To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets.

However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models.

Despite the progress in the field, making accurate forecasts remains challenging because real-world time series contain both global trends, local fine-grained structure, and features on multiple scales in between. Here, we present a new forecasting method, PRISM (Partitioned Representation for Iterative Sequence Modeling), that addresses this challenge through a learnable tree-based partitioning of the signal. At the root of the tree, a global representation captures coarse trends in the signal, while recursive splits reveal increasingly localized views of the signal. At each level of the tree, data are projected onto a time-frequency basis (e.g., wavelets or exponential moving averages) to extract scale-specific features, which are then aggregated across the hierarchy. This design allows the model to jointly capture global structure and local dynamics of the signal, enabling accurate forecasting. Experiments across benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods for forecasting. Overall, these results demonstrate that our hierarchical approach provides a lightweight and flexible framework for forecasting multivariate time series.

Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel \"Embedding-to-Label\" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance.

Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u56fe\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08FSF\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u9891\u7387\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u6216\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff09\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff08FSF\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u9891\u7387\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86FPH-ML\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u548cFPH-GNN\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6301\u4e45\u540c\u8c03\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eFPH-ML\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u548c\u5ea6\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1bFPH\u4e0e\u56fe\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7ed3\u5408\u540e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u76f8\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53470.4%-21%\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53478.2\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "FSF\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u9891\u7e41\u5b50\u56fe\u6316\u6398\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.\n  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias.

Sequential approaches to these problems can be unified under a new framework, Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL), in which the goal is to select the most beneficial candidate set of partners for all participants using trials; that is, to learn a directed graph that represents the highest-performing contributions. We demonstrate that a new pure-exploration model, the semi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB), in which a single evaluation provides distinct feedback to multiple bandits due to structural overlap among their arms, can be used to learn a support network from sparse candidate lists efficiently.\n  We develop a generalized GapE algorithm for SOMMABs and derive new exponential error bounds that improve the best known constant in the exponent for multi-bandit best-arm identification. The bounds scale linearly with the degree of overlap, revealing significant sample-complexity gains arising from shared evaluations.\n  From an application point of view, this work provides a theoretical foundation and improved performance guarantees for sequential learning tools for identifying support networks from sparse candidates in multiple learning problems, such as in multi-task learning (MTL), auxiliary task learning (ATL), federated learning (FL), and in multi-agent systems (MAS).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SSNL\u6846\u67b6\u548cSOMMAB\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5236\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u4ee3AI/ML\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u8bc4\u4f30\u5408\u4f5c\u4f19\u4f34\u8d21\u732e\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u4f46\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86Sequential Support Network Learning (SSNL)\u6846\u67b6\u548csemi-overlapping multi-(multi-armed) bandit (SOMMAB)\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e7f\u4e49GapE\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u6700\u4f73\u81c2\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5e38\u6570\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u91cd\u53e0\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u652f\u6301\u7f51\u7edc\u8bc6\u522b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5171\u4eab\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u663e\u8457\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels", "AI": {"tldr": "DMSAEs\u901a\u8fc7\u84b8\u998f\u5faa\u73af\u63d0\u53d6\u6838\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAEs\uff09\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u5e38\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd0\u884c\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u91ca\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u84b8\u998fMatryoshka\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08DMSAEs\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u84b8\u998f\u5faa\u73af\u8bad\u7ec3\u5171\u4eab\u6838\u5fc3\u7684Matryoshka SAE\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6X\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5ea6\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u6700\u5c0f\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u4ec5\u8f6c\u79fb\u6838\u5fc3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6743\u91cd\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gemma-2-2B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u4e03\u8f6e\u84b8\u998f\uff08500M tokens\uff0c65k\u5bbd\u5ea6\uff09\u5f97\u5230197\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6838\u5fc3\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u4e2aSAEBench\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "DMSAEs\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4e00\u81f4\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples.

However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "OFL-SAM2\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u5c06\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5728\u7ebf\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "SAM2\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u90fd\u9700\u8981\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u53c2\u4e0e\u4e14\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u3002OFL-SAM2\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6807\u7b7e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a(1)\u5728\u7ebf\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u6620\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\uff1b(2)\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u6574\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3SAM2\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6620\u5c04\u7f51\u7edc\u6355\u83b7\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u624b\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eOFL-SAM2\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "OFL-SAM2\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86SAM2\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u7531\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5206\u5272\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLMs\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884ctoken\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660eDLMs\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u957f\u5ea6\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\uff08CoT\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6a21\u62df\u4efb\u4f55\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6b65\u9aa4\u6570\u3002\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u63a9\u7801\u6216\u4fee\u8ba2\u529f\u80fd\u7684DLMs\u8fd8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u542f\u7528\u4fee\u8ba2\u529f\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u9ad8DLMs\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5206\u6790DLMs\u7ed3\u5408CoT\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u65e0\u4fee\u8ba2\u3001\u91cd\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u4fee\u8ba2\uff09\u4e0bDLMs\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660eDLMs+CoT\u53ef\u4ee5\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u62df\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u91cd\u63a9\u7801\u6216\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684DLMs\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u7a7a\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff1b\u4fee\u8ba2\u529f\u80fd\u4f7fDLMs\u5177\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "DLMs\u662f\u6700\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u5728DLMs\u4e2d\u542f\u7528\u4fee\u8ba2\u529f\u80fd\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u5176\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "ResponseRank\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u6709\u6548\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548cRL\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e8c\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u53ea\u80fd\u4f20\u8fbe\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u8861\u91cf\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u548c\u504f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5143\u6570\u636e\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u901a\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faResponseRank\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u7406\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u5bf9\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6309\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ec5\u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u5185\u6bd4\u8f83\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5f3a\u5ea6\u6d3e\u751f\u6392\u540d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6548\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff1a\u5408\u6210\u504f\u597d\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\uff08\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548cRL\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u56de\u5408\u56de\u62a5\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "ResponseRank\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u566a\u58f0\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e2d\u7a33\u5065\u5b66\u4e60\u504f\u597d\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807Pearson\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6765\u9694\u79bb\u57fa\u6570\u6548\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5e8f\u6570\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model.

This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets.

In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful content-understanding ability to help human expert better restore indistinguishable film defects.Specifically, we employ a patch-wise training and testing strategy to make restoring high-resolution films on one 24GB-VRAMR GPU possible and design a position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules.Also, we introduce a global-local frequency module to reconstruct consistent textures among different patches. Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods.

Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.\n  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration.

CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability.

To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking.

However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$\u03c0$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$\u03c0$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach.

IEEE Catalog Number: CFP25592-ART", "summary": "Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio.

Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as \"re-indexing\". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RFL-ReID\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfL-ReID\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u6210\u672c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\uff0c\u8fd9\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u9ad8\u6602\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cc\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u517c\u5bb9\u8868\u793a\uff08Bi-C2R\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u56fe\u5e93\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b0\u65e7\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u7d22\u5f15\u5386\u53f2\u56fe\u5e93\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u591a\u57fa\u51c6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cBi-C2R\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728RFL-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f20\u7edfL-ReID\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Bi-C2R\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec8\u8eab\u884c\u4eba\u91cd\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u517c\u5bb9\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity.

Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability.

Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.
