TL;DR: TeleWorld是一个实时多模态4D世界建模框架，通过生成-重建-引导范式统一视频生成、动态场景重建和长期世界记忆，实现交互式、具有记忆功能的世界模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型在实时交互、长期一致性和动态场景持久记忆方面存在局限，阻碍了其发展为实用的世界模型。

Method: 采用生成-重建-引导范式，结合自回归扩散视频模型、宏微观规划层次方法和分布匹配蒸馏技术，构建统一的4D时空表示框架。

Result: 实验表明TeleWorld在静态和动态世界理解、长期一致性和实时生成效率方面表现优异。

Conclusion: TeleWorld为实现交互式、具有记忆功能的多模态生成和具身智能世界模型迈出了实用的一步。

Abstract: World models aim to endow AI systems with the ability to represent, generate, and interact with dynamic environments in a coherent and temporally consistent manner. While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出通过噪声优化来解决文本到图像模型的模态崩溃问题，相比传统方法具有更好的生成质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型存在显著的模态崩溃现象，即相同文本提示下生成的图像缺乏多样性。现有方法主要通过引导机制或候选池筛选来解决，但效果有限。

Method: 采用简单的噪声优化目标，通过优化初始噪声来增加生成图像的多样性，同时分析不同频率特性的噪声初始化对优化效果的影响。

Result: 实验表明噪声优化方法在生成质量和多样性方面均优于现有方法，能够有效缓解模态崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 噪声优化是一种简单有效的解决方案，能够在不损害基础模型保真度的前提下提升文本到图像生成的多样性。

Abstract: Contemporary text-to-image models exhibit a surprising degree of mode collapse, as can be seen when sampling several images given the same text prompt. While previous work has attempted to address this issue by steering the model using guidance mechanisms, or by generating a large pool of candidates and refining them, in this work we take a different direction and aim for diversity in generations via noise optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple noise optimization objective can mitigate mode collapse while preserving the fidelity of the base model. We also analyze the frequency characteristics of the noise and show that alternative noise initializations with different frequency profiles can improve both optimization and search. Our experiments demonstrate that noise optimization yields superior results in terms of generation quality and variety.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Spatial4D-Bench，一个用于评估多模态大语言模型4D空间智能的大规模基准测试，包含约40,000个问答对，覆盖18个任务和6个认知类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类天生具备4D空间智能，但现有空间智能基准测试规模小、多样性不足。本文旨在系统评估MLLMs在4D空间推理方面是否达到人类水平。

Method: 构建了包含约40,000个问答对的大规模基准测试，涵盖18个明确定义的任务，这些任务被系统组织到6个认知类别中。

Result: 在Spatial4D-Bench上评估了各种最先进的MLLMs，发现它们在路径规划、动作识别和物理合理性推理等多种4D空间推理方面存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 该基准测试为社区提供了有价值的见解，有望促进开发更强大的MLLMs，使其向人类水平的4D空间智能发展。

Abstract: 4D spatial intelligence involves perceiving and processing how objects move or change over time. Humans naturally possess 4D spatial intelligence, supporting a broad spectrum of spatial reasoning abilities. To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning. We hope that the findings provided in this work offer valuable insights to the community and that our benchmark can facilitate the development of more capable MLLMs toward human-level 4D spatial intelligence.

### [4] [A Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network for multimodal post-flood water extent mapping using SAR and incomplete multispectral data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00123)
*Hyunho Lee,Wenwen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SMAGNet模型，通过SAR和MSI数据的多模态融合改进洪水淹没范围制图，在MSI数据部分缺失时仍保持良好性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 洪水期间准确及时的水域制图对灾害管理至关重要，但现有方法在MSI数据部分可用时的自适应集成研究不足

Method: 开发了SMATNet（空间掩码自适应门控网络），以SAR数据为主要输入，通过特征融合集成互补的MSI数据

Result: 在C2S-MS Floods数据集上，SMAGNet在不同MSI数据可用性水平下均优于其他多模态深度学习模型，即使MSI数据完全缺失时性能仍与仅使用SAR数据的U-Net相当

Conclusion: SMAGNet增强了模型对缺失数据的鲁棒性，提高了多模态深度学习在真实洪水管理场景中的适用性

Abstract: Mapping water extent during a flood event is essential for effective disaster management throughout all phases: mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery. In particular, during the response stage, when timely and accurate information is important, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data are primarily employed to produce water extent maps. Recently, leveraging the complementary characteristics of SAR and MSI data through a multimodal approach has emerged as a promising strategy for advancing water extent mapping using deep learning models. This approach is particularly beneficial when timely post-flood observations, acquired during or shortly after the flood peak, are limited, as it enables the use of all available imagery for more accurate post-flood water extent mapping. However, the adaptive integration of partially available MSI data into the SAR-based post-flood water extent mapping process remains underexplored. To bridge this research gap, we propose the Spatially Masked Adaptive Gated Network (SMAGNet), a multimodal deep learning model that utilizes SAR data as the primary input for post-flood water extent mapping and integrates complementary MSI data through feature fusion. In experiments on the C2S-MS Floods dataset, SMAGNet consistently outperformed other multimodal deep learning models in prediction performance across varying levels of MSI data availability. Furthermore, we found that even when MSI data were completely missing, the performance of SMAGNet remained statistically comparable to that of a U-Net model trained solely on SAR data. These findings indicate that SMAGNet enhances the model robustness to missing data as well as the applicability of multimodal deep learning in real-world flood management scenarios.

### [5] [Compressed Map Priors for 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00139)
*Brady Zhou,Philipp Krähenbühl*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Compressed Map Priors (CMP)框架，通过历史遍历数据学习空间先验，显著提升3D目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自动驾驶视觉系统每次遇到新位置都像第一次访问，但实际大部分部署区域都已被多次访问过，应利用历史空间信息

Method: 使用二值化哈希图存储空间先验信息，存储密度为32KB/km²，比密集存储减少20倍，可轻松集成到主流3D感知系统中

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，多个架构的3D目标检测性能均获得显著且一致的提升

Conclusion: CMP框架简单有效，能以极低计算成本利用历史空间先验信息，显著改善自动驾驶感知系统性能

Abstract: Human drivers rarely travel where no person has gone before. After all, thousands of drivers use busy city roads every day, and only one can claim to be the first. The same holds for autonomous computer vision systems. The vast majority of the deployment area of an autonomous vision system will have been visited before. Yet, most autonomous vehicle vision systems act as if they are encountering each location for the first time. In this work, we present Compressed Map Priors (CMP), a simple but effective framework to learn spatial priors from historic traversals. The map priors use a binarized hashmap that requires only $32\text{KB}/\text{km}^2$, a $20\times$ reduction compared to the dense storage. Compressed Map Priors easily integrate into leading 3D perception systems at little to no extra computational costs, and lead to a significant and consistent improvement in 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset across several architectures.

*Lawrence Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GLASS是一种结合全局重采样视图和多个随机局部裁剪的AI生成图像检测架构，通过分层采样和注意力机制聚合信息，在保持计算效率的同时提升检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI生成图像检测架构通常会对图像进行下采样，导致细粒度细节丢失。需要一种能够同时利用全局和局部信息的方法来处理任意尺寸的图像。

Method: 提出GLASS架构，结合全局重采样视图和多个随机局部裁剪，使用空间分层采样高效选择原始分辨率区域，并通过基于注意力的评分机制进行信息聚合。

Result: 实验表明，在Vision Transformer、ResNet和ConvNeXt等骨干网络上，GLASS相比标准迁移学习方法在预测性能上有显著提升，同时保持可行的计算约束。

Conclusion: GLASS架构通过全局-局部注意力机制和分层采样策略，有效提升了AI生成图像检测的准确性，为处理高分辨率图像提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of generative AI has made AI-generated images increasingly realistic and high-resolution. Most AI-generated image detection architectures typically downsample images before inputting them into models, risking the loss of fine-grained details. This paper presents GLASS (Global-Local Attention with Stratified Sampling), an architecture that combines a globally resized view with multiple randomly sampled local crops. These crops are original-resolution regions efficiently selected through spatially stratified sampling and aggregated using attention-based scoring. GLASS can be integrated into vision models to leverage both global and local information in images of any size. Vision Transformer, ResNet, and ConvNeXt models are used as backbones, and experiments show that GLASS outperforms standard transfer learning by achieving higher predictive performance within feasible computational constraints.

*Yehui Yang,Dalu Yang,Wenshuo Zhou,Fangxin Shang,Yifan Liu,Jie Ren,Haojun Fei,Qing Yang,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FCMBench-V1.0是一个针对金融信贷领域的多模态基准测试，包含4,043张隐私合规图像和8,446个问答样本，评估维度包括感知、推理和鲁棒性，在23个先进视觉语言模型上进行了广泛测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态AI在信贷风险评估和文档审查中的广泛应用，迫切需要能够反映金融信贷特定文档和工作流程、包含信贷特定理解能力且符合隐私合规的领域专用基准测试。

Method: 通过封闭式合成-捕获管道构建样本：手动合成带有虚拟内容的文档模板，并在内部捕获场景感知图像，避免使用网络来源或公开图像来减轻预训练数据泄露风险。

Result: 在23个最先进的视觉语言模型测试中，Gemini 3 Pro作为商业模型表现最佳（F1分数64.61），Qwen3-VL-235B作为开源基线最佳（57.27），而作者提出的金融信贷专用模型Qfin-VL-Instruct获得最高分（64.92）。鲁棒性评估显示即使表现最好的模型在采集伪影下也会出现明显性能下降。

Conclusion: FCMBench能够有效区分现代视觉语言模型的性能差异和鲁棒性，为金融信贷领域的多模态AI应用提供了重要的评估工具，同时解决了隐私合规和实用性的平衡问题。

Abstract: As multimodal AI becomes widely used for credit risk assessment and document review, a domain-specific benchmark is urgently needed that (1) reflects documents and workflows specific to financial credit applications, (2) includes credit-specific understanding and real-world robustness, and (3) preserves privacy compliance without sacrificing practical utility. Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92). Robustness evaluations show that even top-performing models suffer noticeable performance drops under acquisition artifacts.

### [8] [Focal-RegionFace: Generating Fine-Grained Multi-attribute Descriptions for Arbitrarily Selected Face Focal Regions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00156)
*Kaiwen Zheng,Junchen Fu,Songpei Xu,Yaoqing He,Joemon M. Jose,Han Hu,Xuri Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了FaceFocalDesc问题，旨在生成和识别包含面部动作单元、情绪状态和年龄估计的多属性自然语言描述，并针对任意选定面部区域。通过构建新数据集和基于Qwen2.5-VL的Focal-RegionFace模型，实现了可解释的细粒度面部分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决面部分析中未被充分探索的问题：为任意选定面部区域生成多属性自然语言描述，认为系统关注个体面部区域能带来更好的理解和控制能力。

Method: 构建了新的多属性描述数据集，提出基于Qwen2.5-VL的Focal-RegionFace模型，通过多阶段渐进式微调逐步细化对局部面部特征的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明，Focal-RegionFace在新基准测试的传统指标和新提出的指标上都取得了最佳性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在细粒度多属性面部区域聚焦分析场景中表现出有效性和通用性。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an underexplored problem in facial analysis: generating and recognizing multi-attribute natural language descriptions, containing facial action units (AUs), emotional states, and age estimation, for arbitrarily selected face regions (termed FaceFocalDesc). We argue that the system's ability to focus on individual facial areas leads to better understanding and control. To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics. This fully verifies its effectiveness and versatility in fine-grained multi-attribute face region-focal analysis scenarios.

### [9] [DichroGAN: Towards Restoration of in-air Colours of Seafloor from Satellite Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00194)
*Salma Gonzalez-Sabbagh,Antonio Robles-Kelly,Shang Gao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DichroGAN是一个条件生成对抗网络，用于从卫星图像恢复海底的空中颜色，通过两步训练过程估计大气场景辐射和光传输，消除水下光吸收和散射的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于光在水柱中随深度呈指数衰减，从卫星图像恢复海底的空中颜色具有挑战性，需要解决光吸收和散射的问题。

Method: 采用条件生成对抗网络（cGAN），分两步训练：两个生成器利用高光谱图像估计漫反射和镜面反射以获取大气场景辐射；另外两个生成器分别处理场景辐射和估计水下光传输，基于水下图像形成方程恢复颜色。

Result: 在PRISMA卫星图像和 underwater 数据集上的广泛实验表明，DichroGAN在水下恢复技术中达到了竞争性性能。

Conclusion: DichroGAN通过多生成器协作有效恢复了海底的空中颜色，展示了在水下图像处理中的潜力。

Abstract: Recovering the in-air colours of seafloor from satellite imagery is a challenging task due to the exponential attenuation of light with depth in the water column. In this study, we present DichroGAN, a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) designed for this purpose. DichroGAN employs a two-steps simultaneous training: first, two generators utilise a hyperspectral image cube to estimate diffuse and specular reflections, thereby obtaining atmospheric scene radiance. Next, a third generator receives as input the generated scene radiance containing the features of each spectral band, while a fourth generator estimates the underwater light transmission. These generators work together to remove the effects of light absorption and scattering, restoring the in-air colours of seafloor based on the underwater image formation equation. DichroGAN is trained on a compact dataset derived from PRISMA satellite imagery, comprising RGB images paired with their corresponding spectral bands and masks. Extensive experiments on both satellite and underwater datasets demonstrate that DichroGAN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art underwater restoration techniques.

*Xiaokun Sun,Zeyu Cai,Hao Tang,Ying Tai,Jian Yang,Zhenyu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MorphAny3D是一个无需训练的高质量3D变形框架，利用结构化潜在表示（SLAT）实现跨类别的语义一致和时间平滑的3D变形。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D变形中生成语义一致且时间平滑的变形序列的挑战，特别是在跨类别场景下。

Method: 提出Morphing Cross-Attention（MCA）融合源和目标信息保证结构一致性，Temporal-Fused Self-Attention（TFSA）增强时间一致性，以及方向校正策略缓解姿态模糊问题。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成最先进的变形序列，即使在具有挑战性的跨类别情况下也表现优异。

Conclusion: MorphAny3D框架支持解耦变形和3D风格迁移等高级应用，并能推广到其他基于SLAT的生成模型。

Abstract: 3D morphing remains challenging due to the difficulty of generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth deformations, especially across categories. We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于3D实例分割的作物计数框架，通过多视角2D图像和神经辐射场（NeRF）技术解决户外环境中作物遮挡和聚类问题，实现高精度计数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 户外田间环境中，作物部分遮挡和从单一视角难以区分聚类作物的问题严重制约了基于图像的作物计数方法。

Method: 利用多视角2D图像，结合神经辐射场（NeRF）视图合成技术，引入作物可见性和掩码一致性评分，实现3D作物实例分割。

Result: 在棉花、苹果和梨三个农业数据集上验证，尽管作物颜色、形状和大小差异很大，但计数性能稳定，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了作物计数中的遮挡和聚类问题，无需作物特定参数调优，并贡献了棉花植物数据集以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Rigorous crop counting is crucial for effective agricultural management and informed intervention strategies. However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks. Lastly, we contribute a cotton plant dataset to advance further research on this topic.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出IntraStyler方法，通过基于示例的风格合成来解决无监督域适应中的域内变异性问题，无需预先指定域内变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图像级域对齐方法主要关注源域和目标域之间的域偏移，而域内变异性研究不足。传统方法需要预先指定域内变化进行风格合成，这在实际中不实用。

Method: 提出基于示例的风格合成方法IntraStyler，使用示例图像指导风格合成。引入基于对比学习的风格编码器来提取纯风格特征，无需先验知识即可捕获多样化的域内风格。

Conclusion: IntraStyler能够有效捕获域内风格多样性，为无监督域适应提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Image-level domain alignment is the de facto approach for unsupervised domain adaptation, where unpaired image translation is used to minimize the domain gap. Prior studies mainly focus on the domain shift between the source and target domains, whereas the intra-domain variability remains under-explored. To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023. Our experiments show the efficacy of our method in controllable style synthesis and the benefits of diverse synthetic data for downstream segmentation.

*Omar Sharif,Eftekhar Hossain,Patrick Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用奖励驱动的强化学习来增强多模态大语言模型的视觉推理能力，通过设计针对图像理解、思维步骤和答案准确性的奖励函数，显著提升了模型在视觉谜题等任务上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型生成的推理链缺乏对视觉信息的整合，限制了其在需要准确视觉感知的任务（如视觉谜题）上的能力。研究表明视觉感知是此类任务的关键瓶颈。

Method: 采用奖励驱动的强化学习方法，设计了六种针对不同推理方面的奖励函数，使用组相对策略优化（GRPO）来激励更长、结构化的推理，并防止视觉信息被绕过。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型上实现了5.56%的性能提升，在领域内和领域外设置中均取得一致增益。将图像转换为文本描述可使Claude 3.5和Claude 3.7分别提升26.7%和23.6%的性能。

Conclusion: 奖励驱动的强化学习是提升多模态大语言模型视觉推理能力的有效方法，能够显著改善模型在需要复杂视觉感知任务上的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for eliciting reasoning chains before generating final answers. However, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate reasoning that lacks integration of visual information. This limits their ability to solve problems that demand accurate visual perception, such as visual puzzles. We show that visual perception is the key bottleneck in such tasks: converting images into textual descriptions significantly improves performance, yielding gains of 26.7% for Claude 3.5 and 23.6% for Claude 3.7.
  To address this, we investigate reward-driven RL as a mechanism to unlock long visual reasoning in open-source MLLMs without requiring costly supervision. We design and evaluate six reward functions targeting different reasoning aspects, including image understanding, thinking steps, and answer accuracy. Using group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly incentivizes longer, structured reasoning and mitigates bypassing of visual information. Experiments on Qwen-2.5-VL-7B achieve 5.56% improvements over the base model, with consistent gains across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a prevalent and fundamental technique that discretizes continuous feature vectors by approximating them using a codebook. As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook.

*Aobo Li,Jinjian Wu,Yongxu Liu,Leida Li,Weisheng Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出SynDR-IQA框架，通过重塑合成数据分布来解决BIQA模型泛化能力不足的问题，采用内容上采样和聚类下采样策略提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于合成数据的BIQA模型泛化能力有限，研究发现这是因为合成数据学习到的特征呈现离散聚类模式，高质量图像特征围绕参考图像聚类，低质量图像特征按失真类型聚类，这种分布问题限制了回归性能。

Method: 提出SynDR-IQA框架，基于样本多样性和冗余性对泛化误差影响的理论推导，采用两种策略：1）分布感知的多样化内容上采样，增强视觉多样性同时保持内容分布；2）密度感知的冗余聚类下采样，通过减少密集聚类区域的样本密度来平衡样本分布。

Result: 在三种跨数据集设置（合成到真实、合成到算法、合成到合成）上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: SynDR-IQA通过重塑合成数据分布有效提升了BIQA模型的泛化能力，为解决合成数据训练模型的局限性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) has advanced significantly through deep learning, but the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets remains a challenge. While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

TL;DR: 提出一种结合CycleGAN和YOLOv8的跨模态数据增强框架，解决PCB缺陷检测中红外数据稀缺问题，通过合成伪红外样本提升检测性能。


<details>

Motivation: 解决红外数据稀缺对PCB缺陷检测的瓶颈问题，传统方法依赖配对监督数据，但实际应用中红外数据获取困难且成本高昂。

Method: 使用CycleGAN进行非配对图像转换，将丰富的可见光PCB图像映射到红外域，合成高保真伪红外样本；构建异构训练策略，融合生成数据与有限真实红外样本训练轻量级YOLOv8检测器。

Result: 该方法在低数据条件下有效增强特征学习，增强后的检测器性能显著优于仅使用有限真实数据的模型，接近全监督训练的性能基准。

Conclusion: 伪红外合成作为一种稳健的数据增强策略，在工业检测中具有显著效果，为解决红外数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of infrared (IR) data scarcity in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) defect detection by proposing a cross-modal data augmentation framework integrating CycleGAN and YOLOv8. Unlike conventional methods relying on paired supervision, we leverage CycleGAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, mapping abundant visible-light PCB images into the infrared domain. This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances feature learning under low-data conditions. The augmented detector significantly outperforms models trained on limited real data alone and approaches the performance benchmarks of fully supervised training, proving the efficacy of pseudo-IR synthesis as a robust augmentation strategy for industrial inspection.

Result: 轻量级CNN在保持高精度的同时显著降低计算复杂度，决策支持系统减少了对传统化学农药的依赖，促进了可持续农业实践。

Conclusion: 该框架在精准农业中具有实时应用潜力，特别适合资源有限的农业环境。

Abstract: Effective pest management is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity, especially for crops such as sugarcane and wheat that are highly vulnerable to pest infestations. Traditional pest management methods depend heavily on manual field inspections and the use of chemical pesticides. These approaches are often costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can have a negative impact on the environment. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a lightweight framework for pest detection and pesticide recommendation, designed for low-resource devices such as smartphones and drones, making it suitable for use by small and marginal farmers.
  The proposed framework includes two main components. The first is a Pest Detection Module that uses a compact, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with prototypical meta-learning to accurately identify pests even when only a few training samples are available. The second is a Pesticide Recommendation Module that incorporates environmental factors like crop type and growth stage to suggest safe and eco-friendly pesticide recommendations. To train and evaluate our framework, a comprehensive pest image dataset was developed by combining multiple publicly available datasets. The final dataset contains samples with different viewing angles, pest sizes, and background conditions to ensure strong generalization.
  Experimental results show that the proposed lightweight CNN achieves high accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing computational complexity. The Decision Support System additionally improves pest management by reducing dependence on traditional chemical pesticides and encouraging sustainable practices, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications in precision agriculture.

Conclusion: 器官分离学习框架为3D-CT基础模型的实际应用提供了现实有效的设计指南。

Abstract: While foundation models in radiology are expected to be applied to various clinical tasks, computational cost constraints remain a major challenge when training on 3D-CT volumetric data. In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that the organ-separated learning framework can serve as a realistic and effective design guideline for the practical implementation of 3D-CT foundation models.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has revolutionized general domain tasks, yet its application in scientific discovery is hindered by the profound semantic gap between complex scientific imagery and sparse textual descriptions. We present S1-MMAlign, a large-scale, multi-disciplinary multimodal dataset comprising over 15.5 million high-quality image-text pairs derived from 2.5 million open-access scientific papers. Spanning disciplines from physics and biology to engineering, the dataset captures diverse visual modalities including experimental setups, heatmaps, and microscopic imagery.

Technical validation demonstrates that this enhancement significantly improves data quality: SciBERT-based pseudo-perplexity metrics show reduced semantic ambiguity, while CLIP scores indicate an 18.21% improvement in image-text alignment. S1-MMAlign provides a foundational resource for advancing scientific reasoning and cross-modal understanding in the era of AI for Science.

Conclusion: 该方法建立了一种新的即插即用范式，为扩散模型中的轻量级但有效的概念操作提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation capabilities, yet they raise significant concerns regarding safety, copyright, and ethical implications. Existing concept erasure methods address these risks by removing sensitive concepts from pre-trained models, but most of them rely on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning, which poses a critical limitation. To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability. Our approach also exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, establishing a new plug-and-play paradigm for lightweight yet effective concept manipulation in diffusion models.

Conclusion: DVEFormer可作为传统分割方法的即插即用替代方案，支持灵活的自然语言查询，并无缝集成到移动机器人的3D建图流程中。

Abstract: In domestic environments, robots require a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings to interact effectively and intuitively with untrained humans. In this paper, we propose DVEFormer - an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation. Instead of directly performing classical semantic segmentation with fixed predefined classes, our method uses teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to guide our efficient student model DVEFormer in learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings. While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3 FPS for the full model and 77.0 FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. Additionally, we show qualitative results that highlight the effectiveness and possible use cases in real-world applications. Overall, our method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional segmentation approaches while enabling flexible natural-language querying and seamless integration into 3D mapping pipelines for mobile robotics.

TL;DR: FaithSCAN是一个轻量级网络，通过利用VLM的丰富内部信号（包括token级解码不确定性、中间视觉表示和跨模态对齐特征）来检测VQA中的幻觉问题，无需昂贵的人工标注即可实现高检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA幻觉检测方法存在效率低、鲁棒性差和检测性能有限的问题：外部验证方法计算开销大且依赖外部资源质量，不确定性驱动方法仅捕捉有限的模型不确定性方面。

Method: 提出FaithSCAN网络，融合多种内部信号（解码不确定性、视觉表示、跨模态对齐），通过分支证据编码和不确定性感知注意力进行融合。采用基于LLM-as-a-Judge的低成本策略自动生成监督信号。

Result: 在多个VQA基准测试中，FaithSCAN在效果和效率上都显著优于现有方法。深入分析发现幻觉源于视觉感知、跨模态推理和语言解码的系统性内部状态变化。

Conclusion: 不同内部信号提供互补的诊断线索，幻觉模式因VLM架构而异，为多模态幻觉的潜在原因提供了新见解。FaithSCAN在效率和准确性方面均表现优异。

Abstract: Faithfulness hallucinations in VQA occur when vision-language models produce fluent yet visually ungrounded answers, severely undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为DUAL的模型无关不确定性感知框架，用于在遥感长尾分布中动态分离预测不确定性，通过认知不确定性指导重加权策略处理难样本，利用偶然不确定性抑制噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 遥感数据中普遍存在长尾分布，传统方法往往不加区分地强调所有低置信度样本，导致在噪声数据上过拟合。需要解决如何从噪声模糊样本中分离真正难样本的关键挑战。

Method: 基于证据深度学习，提出DUAL框架将预测不确定性动态分解为认知不确定性（EU）和偶然不确定性（AU）。EU作为样本稀缺性指标指导重加权策略，AU量化数据模糊性并采用自适应标签平滑机制抑制噪声。

Result: 在多个数据集和各种骨干网络上的广泛实验表明，该框架有效且具有良好泛化性，超越了TGN和SADE等强基线方法。消融研究进一步验证了设计选择的关键性。

Conclusion: DUAL框架通过不确定性分解有效解决了遥感长尾分布中的样本分离问题，为处理难样本和抑制噪声提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-Tailed distributions are pervasive in remote sensing due to the inherently imbalanced occurrence of grounded objects. However, a critical challenge remains largely overlooked, i.e., disentangling hard tail data samples from noisy ambiguous ones. Conventional methods often indiscriminately emphasize all low-confidence samples, leading to overfitting on noisy data. To bridge this gap, building upon Evidential Deep Learning, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware framework termed DUAL, which dynamically disentangles prediction uncertainty into Epistemic Uncertainty (EU) and Aleatoric Uncertainty (AU). Specifically, we introduce EU as an indicator of sample scarcity to guide a reweighting strategy for hard-to-learn tail samples, while leveraging AU to quantify data ambiguity, employing an adaptive label smoothing mechanism to suppress the impact of noise. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across various backbones demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework, surpassing strong baselines such as TGN and SADE. Ablation studies provide further insights into the crucial choices of our design.

Motivation: 传统GS-SLAM的残差驱动密度化过程效率较低且容易导致早期建图不稳定，需要一种更高效的初始化方法来提升收敛速度和渲染质量。

Result: 在TUM RGB-D和Replica数据集上，RGS-SLAM相比现有高斯和点基SLAM系统达到竞争性或更优的定位重建精度，收敛速度提升约20%，最高可达925 FPS的实时建图性能。

Conclusion: RGS-SLAM通过训练无关的对应关系初始化方法有效提升了高斯SLAM的稳定性和效率，在纹理丰富和杂乱场景中具有更高的渲染保真度，且与现有GS-SLAM管道完全兼容。

Abstract: We introduce RGS-SLAM, a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces the residual-driven densification stage of GS-SLAM with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization. Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20\%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.

TL;DR: SV-GS是一个用于稀疏观测下动态目标重建的框架，通过同时估计变形模型和物体运动来解决稀疏视角和时间采样带来的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态目标重建在现实场景中面临观测稀疏的挑战，传统方法需要密集的视角和时间采样，而实际应用中（如监控摄像头）观测往往是稀疏的。

Method: 利用粗略骨架图和初始静态重建作为输入，优化骨架驱动的变形场，包括粗粒度骨架关节姿态估计器和细粒度变形模块，仅使关节姿态估计器随时间变化以实现平滑运动插值。

Result: 在合成数据集上PSNR提升高达34%，在真实数据集上使用显著更少的帧数即可达到与密集单目视频方法相当的性能。

Conclusion: SV-GS在稀疏观测条件下有效实现了动态重建，且可通过扩散生成先验替代初始静态重建，提升了实际应用可行性。

Abstract: Reconstructing a dynamic target moving over a large area is challenging. Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: As dermatological conditions become increasingly common and the availability of dermatologists remains limited, there is a growing need for intelligent tools to support both patients and clinicians in the timely and accurate diagnosis of skin diseases. In this project, we developed a deep learning based model for the classification and diagnosis of skin conditions. By leveraging pretraining on publicly available skin disease image datasets, our model effectively extracted visual features and accurately classified various dermatological cases. Throughout the project, we refined the model architecture, optimized data preprocessing workflows, and applied targeted data augmentation techniques to improve overall performance. The final model, based on the Swin Transformer, achieved a prediction accuracy of 87.71 percent across eight skin lesion classes on the ISIC2019 dataset. These results demonstrate the model's potential as a diagnostic support tool for clinicians and a self assessment aid for patients.

TL;DR: TimeColor是一个基于草图的视频着色模型，支持使用异构、可变数量的参考图像（如角色表、背景图像或任意着色帧），通过逐参考区域分配和时空对应掩码注意力机制提升色彩保真度、身份一致性和时间稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有着色模型通常仅基于单参考（如场景第一帧），忽略了其他条件数据源（角色表、背景图像等），导致信息利用不足。

Method: 将参考编码为额外潜在帧并时序拼接，使用时空对应掩码注意力和模态分离RoPE索引，防止捷径学习和跨身份调色板泄漏。

Result: 在SAKUGA-42M数据集上的实验表明，TimeColor在单参考和多参考协议下均优于现有基线。

Conclusion: TimeColor通过异构参考和区域绑定机制有效提升了视频着色质量。

Abstract: Most colorization models condition only on a single reference, typically the first frame of the scene. However, this approach ignores other sources of conditional data, such as character sheets, background images, or arbitrary colorized frames. We propose TimeColor, a sketch-based video colorization model that supports heterogeneous, variable-count references with the use of explicit per-reference region assignment. TimeColor encodes references as additional latent frames which are concatenated temporally, permitting them to be processed concurrently in each diffusion step while keeping the model's parameter count fixed. TimeColor also uses spatiotemporal correspondence-masked attention to enforce subject-reference binding in addition to modality-disjoint RoPE indexing. These mechanisms mitigate shortcutting and cross-identity palette leakage. Experiments on SAKUGA-42M under both single- and multi-reference protocols show that TimeColor improves color fidelity, identity consistency, and temporal stability over prior baselines.

State-of-the-art methods give good accuracy but with high computational budgets. To remedy this, this paper proposes VisNet, a computationally efficient and effective re-identification model suitable for real-world scenarios. It is the culmination of conceptual contributions, including feature fusion at multiple scales with automatic attention on each, semantic clustering with anatomical body partitioning, a dynamic weight averaging technique to balance classification semantic regularization, and the use of loss function FIDI for improved metric learning tasks. The multiple scales fuse ResNet50's stages 1 through 4 without the use of parallel paths, with semantic clustering introducing spatial constraints through the use of rule-based pseudo-labeling. VisNet achieves 87.05% Rank-1 and 77.65% mAP on the Market-1501 dataset, having 32.41M parameters and 4.601 GFLOPs, hence, proposing a practical approach for real-time deployment in surveillance and mobile applications where computational resources are limited.

Result: 在多个视频行为基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ReMA在不同时空粒度上一致地提升了泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ReMA作为一种即插即用的增强策略，无需额外监督或可训练参数，就能通过控制混合过程有效改善视频行为识别的表示质量。

Abstract: Video behavior recognition demands stable and discriminative representations under complex spatiotemporal variations. However, prevailing data augmentation strategies for videos remain largely perturbation-driven, often introducing uncontrolled variations that amplify non-discriminative factors, which finally weaken intra-class distributional structure and representation drift with inconsistent gains across temporal scales. To address these problems, we propose Representation-aware Mixing Augmentation (ReMA), a plug-and-play augmentation strategy that formulates mixing as a controlled replacement process to expand representations while preserving class-conditional stability. ReMA integrates two complementary mechanisms. Firstly, the Representation Alignment Mechanism (RAM) performs structured intra-class mixing under distributional alignment constraints, suppressing irrelevant intra-class drift while enhancing statistical reliability. Then, the Dynamic Selection Mechanism (DSM) generates motion-aware spatiotemporal masks to localize perturbations, guiding them away from discrimination-sensitive regions and promoting temporal coherence. By jointly controlling how and where mixing is applied, ReMA improves representation robustness without additional supervision or trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on diverse video behavior benchmarks demonstrate that ReMA consistently enhances generalization and robustness across different spatiotemporal granularities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像反射分离方法在反射层和透射层对比度相似时容易混淆，特别是在夜间场景下问题更为严重。

Method: 提出DMDNet网络，包含深度感知扫描（DAScan）引导Mamba关注显著结构，深度协同状态空间模型（DS-SSM）根据深度调节状态激活敏感性，以及记忆专家补偿模块（MECM）利用跨图像历史知识进行层特定补偿。

Result: 在白天和夜间场景下，DMDNet均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过深度感知和记忆补偿机制有效解决了夜间反射分离的挑战，并构建了首个夜间反射分离数据集NightIRS。

Abstract: Image reflection separation aims to disentangle the transmission layer and the reflection layer from a blended image. Existing methods rely on limited information from a single image, tending to confuse the two layers when their contrasts are similar, a challenge more severe at night. To address this issue, we propose the Depth-Memory Decoupling Network (DMDNet). It employs the Depth-Aware Scanning (DAScan) to guide Mamba toward salient structures, promoting information flow along semantic coherence to construct stable states. Working in synergy with DAScan, the Depth-Synergized State-Space Model (DS-SSM) modulates the sensitivity of state activations by depth, suppressing the spread of ambiguous features that interfere with layer disentanglement. Furthermore, we introduce the Memory Expert Compensation Module (MECM), leveraging cross-image historical knowledge to guide experts in providing layer-specific compensation. To address the lack of datasets for nighttime reflection separation, we construct the Nighttime Image Reflection Separation (NightIRS) dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DMDNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both daytime and nighttime.

TL;DR: HarmoniAD是一个频率引导的双分支框架，通过高频和低频路径分别处理结构和语义信息，解决了工业异常检测中的结构-语义权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临结构-语义权衡：结构导向模型对噪声敏感，语义导向模型容易忽略细节。工业产品质检中微小缺陷的漏检会导致严重后果。

Method: 使用CLIP图像编码器提取特征，转换为频域后解耦为高/低频路径。高频分支使用细粒度结构注意力模块增强纹理边缘检测，低频分支使用全局结构上下文模块捕获长距离依赖。采用多类联合训练策略。

Result: 在MVTec-AD、VisA和BTAD数据集上实现了最先进的性能，兼具敏感性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HarmoniAD通过频率域的双分支互补建模，有效平衡了细节检测和语义一致性，为工业异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Anomaly detection is crucial in industrial product quality inspection. Failing to detect tiny defects often leads to serious consequences. Existing methods face a structure-semantics trade-off: structure-oriented models (such as frequency-based filters) are noise-sensitive, while semantics-oriented models (such as CLIP-based encoders) often miss fine details. To address this, we propose HarmoniAD, a frequency-guided dual-branch framework. Features are first extracted by the CLIP image encoder, then transformed into the frequency domain, and finally decoupled into high- and low-frequency paths for complementary modeling of structure and semantics. The high-frequency branch is equipped with a fine-grained structural attention module (FSAM) to enhance textures and edges for detecting small anomalies, while the low-frequency branch uses a global structural context module (GSCM) to capture long-range dependencies and preserve semantic consistency. Together, these branches balance fine detail and global semantics. HarmoniAD further adopts a multi-class joint training strategy, and experiments on MVTec-AD, VisA, and BTAD show state-of-the-art performance with both sensitivity and robustness.

Conclusion: JGA-LBD通过统一的潜在表示和桥接扩散框架，成功实现了从单张RGB图像的高质量3D数字人生成，解决了传统解耦方法的不一致性问题。

Abstract: Achieving consistent and high-fidelity geometry and appearance reconstruction of 3D digital humans from a single RGB image is inherently a challenging task. Existing studies typically resort to decoupled pipelines for geometry estimation and appearance synthesis, often hindering unified reconstruction and causing inconsistencies. This paper introduces \textbf{JGA-LBD}, a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and appearance into a joint latent representation and formulates the generation process as bridge diffusion. Observing that directly integrating heterogeneous input conditions (e.g., depth maps, SMPL models) leads to substantial training difficulties, we unify all conditions into the 3D Gaussian representations, which can be further compressed into a unified latent space through a shared sparse variational autoencoder (VAE). Subsequently, the specialized form of bridge diffusion enables to start with a partial observation of the target latent code and solely focuses on inferring the missing components. Finally, a dedicated decoding module extracts the complete 3D human geometric structure and renders novel views from the inferred latent representation. Experiments demonstrate that JGA-LBD outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of both geometry fidelity and appearance quality, including challenging in-the-wild scenarios. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/haiantyz/JGA-LBD.

Abstract: Speeding is a major contributor to road fatalities, particularly in developing countries such as Uganda, where road safety infrastructure is limited. This study proposes a real-time intelligent traffic surveillance system tailored to such regions, using computer vision techniques to address vehicle detection, license plate recognition, and speed estimation. The study collected a rich dataset using a speed gun, a Canon Camera, and a mobile phone to train the models. License plate detection using YOLOv8 achieved a mean average precision (mAP) of 97.9%. For character recognition of the detected license plate, the CNN model got a character error rate (CER) of 3.85%, while the transformer model significantly reduced the CER to 1.79%. Speed estimation used source and target regions of interest, yielding a good performance of 10 km/h margin of error. Additionally, a database was established to correlate user information with vehicle detection data, enabling automated ticket issuance via SMS via Africa's Talking API. This system addresses critical traffic management needs in resource-constrained environments and shows potential to reduce road accidents through automated traffic enforcement in developing countries where such interventions are urgently needed.

Method: OmniVaT框架包含：1）多模态分数傅里叶适配器（MFFA），将视觉和触觉嵌入映射到统一的嵌入-频率空间；2）离散树生成（DTG）模块，通过分层树结构获得多样可靠的模态分数表示。

Conclusion: 该研究首次成功解决了单域泛化多模态视觉触觉学习任务，提出的OmniVaT框架能够有效应对模态差异和域间差距挑战。

Abstract: Visual-tactile learning (VTL) enables embodied agents to perceive the physical world by integrating visual (VIS) and tactile (TAC) sensors. However, VTL still suffers from modality discrepancies between VIS and TAC images, as well as domain gaps caused by non-standardized tactile sensors and inconsistent data collection procedures. We formulate these challenges as a new task, termed single domain generalization for multimodal VTL (SDG-VTL). In this paper, we propose an OmniVaT framework that, for the first time, successfully addresses this task. On the one hand, OmniVaT integrates a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to map VIS and TAC embeddings into a unified embedding-frequency space, thereby effectively mitigating the modality gap without multi-domain training data or careful cross-modal fusion strategies. On the other hand, it also incorporates a discrete tree generation (DTG) module that obtains diverse and reliable multimodal fractional representations through a hierarchical tree structure, thereby enhancing its adaptivity to fluctuating domain shifts in unseen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior cross-domain generalization performance of OmniVaT on the SDG-VTL task.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级的两阶段框架，用于联合修复受损3D对象的几何和颜色，主要应用于文化遗产文物的数字修复。该方法通过分离损伤定位和重建过程，使用2D卷积网络预测损伤掩码，然后通过扩散式3D U-Net进行掩码条件修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 该研究的动机是解决文化遗产文物数字修复中的3D对象几何和颜色联合修复问题。传统方法往往难以同时处理几何和颜色的完整修复，需要一种能够精确定位损伤并保持观察区域完整性的方法。

Method: 方法分为两个阶段：第一阶段使用2D卷积网络在RGB切片上预测损伤掩码，并聚合成体积掩码；第二阶段使用扩散式3D U-Net直接在体素网格上进行掩码条件修复，同时预测占用率和颜色。采用复合目标函数结合占用重建、掩码颜色重建和感知正则化。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，显式掩码条件是一种实用的方法，可以指导体积扩散模型进行3D几何和颜色的联合修复，为文化遗产数字修复提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a lightweight two-stage framework for joint geometry and color inpainting of damaged 3D objects, motivated by the digital restoration of cultural heritage artifacts. The pipeline separates damage localization from reconstruction. In the first stage, a 2D convolutional network predicts damage masks on RGB slices extracted from a voxelized object, and these predictions are aggregated into a volumetric mask. In the second stage, a diffusion-based 3D U-Net performs mask-conditioned inpainting directly on voxel grids, reconstructing geometry and color while preserving observed regions. The model jointly predicts occupancy and color using a composite objective that combines occupancy reconstruction with masked color reconstruction and perceptual regularization. We evaluate the approach on a curated set of textured artifacts with synthetically generated damage using standard geometric and color metrics. Compared to symmetry-based baselines, our method produces more complete geometry and more coherent color reconstructions at a fixed 32^3 resolution. Overall, the results indicate that explicit mask conditioning is a practical way to guide volumetric diffusion models for joint 3D geometry and color inpainting.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR) has achieved remarkable progress with graph-based architectures. However, most existing methods remain body-centric, focusing on large-scale motions while neglecting subtle hand articulations that are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This work presents a probabilistic dual-stream framework that unifies reliability modeling and multi-modal integration, generalizing expertized learning under uncertainty across both intra-skeleton and cross-modal domains. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a calibration-free preprocessing pipeline that removes canonical-space transformations and learns directly from native coordinates; (2) a probabilistic Noisy-OR fusion that stabilizes reliability-aware dual-stream learning without requiring explicit confidence supervision; and (3) an intra- to cross-modal ensemble that couples four skeleton modalities (Joint, Bone, Joint Motion, and Bone Motion) to RGB representations, bridging structural and visual motion cues in a unified cross-modal formulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks (NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA) and a newly defined hand-centric benchmark exhibit consistent improvements and robustness under noisy and heterogeneous conditions.

Abstract: Roadside litter poses environmental, safety and economic challenges, yet current monitoring relies on labour-intensive surveys and public reporting, providing limited spatial coverage. Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task. Our results show that while CO-DETR and related transformers achieve the best localisation accuracy, real-time models remain constrained by coarse feature hierarchies. RoLID-11K establishes a challenging benchmark for extreme small-object detection in dynamic driving scenes and aims to support the development of scalable, low-cost systems for roadside-litter monitoring.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of AI technologies has accelerated the development of smart factories. In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity. However, in cases where assembly tasks are performed manually over multiple days, implementing smart factory systems remains a challenge. Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset. Our method leverages a Quadruplet Loss-based learning approach for anomaly images and introduces a custom data loader that strategically selects training samples to enhance estimation accuracy. We evaluated our approach using a image datasets: captured during desktop PC assembly. The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net outperformed existing methods on the dataset. Specifically, it improved the estimation accuracy by 1.3% and reduced misclassification between adjacent tasks by 1.9% in the desktop PC dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Conclusion: CPPO提供了一种有效的方法来改进视觉语言模型的感知能力，无需复杂的外部工具，具有更好的训练效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: We introduce CPPO, a Contrastive Perception Policy Optimization method for finetuning vision-language models (VLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced reasoning in language models, extending it to multimodal reasoning requires improving both the perception and reasoning aspects. Prior works tackle this challenge mainly with explicit perception rewards, but disentangling perception tokens from reasoning tokens is difficult, requiring extra LLMs, ground-truth data, forced separation of perception from reasoning by policy model, or applying rewards indiscriminately to all output tokens. CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones. Experiments show that CPPO surpasses previous perception-rewarding methods, while avoiding extra models, making training more efficient and scalable.

Conclusion: MotionPhysics在自然语言引导下产生视觉真实的动态模拟，超越现有技术，同时自动确定物理上合理的参数。

Abstract: Accurately simulating existing 3D objects and a wide variety of materials often demands expert knowledge and time-consuming physical parameter tuning to achieve the desired dynamic behavior. We introduce MotionPhysics, an end-to-end differentiable framework that infers plausible physical parameters from a user-provided natural language prompt for a chosen 3D scene of interest, removing the need for guidance from ground-truth trajectories or annotated videos. Our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model to estimate material parameter values, which are constrained to lie within plausible ranges. We further propose a learnable motion distillation loss that extracts robust motion priors from pretrained video diffusion models while minimizing appearance and geometry inductive biases to guide the simulation. We evaluate MotionPhysics across more than thirty scenarios, including real-world, human-designed, and AI-generated 3D objects, spanning a wide range of materials such as elastic solids, metals, foams, sand, and both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We demonstrate that MotionPhysics produces visually realistic dynamic simulations guided by natural language, surpassing the state of the art while automatically determining physically plausible parameters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了SEUD场景，针对视频修复中退化类型和强度随时间平滑演化的挑战，设计了ORCANet网络，通过CIED模块估计雾霾强度和粗去雾特征，FPG模块生成静态和动态提示来捕捉退化特征，在视频修复任务中取得了优异效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频修复方法主要关注逐帧的退化变化，忽略了现实世界中退化过程的时间连续性。实际中退化类型和强度会随时间平滑演化，多种退化可能共存或逐渐过渡。

Method: 提出ORCANet网络：1）CIED模块利用物理先验估计雾霾强度并提供粗去雾特征初始化；2）FPG模块提取退化特征，生成静态提示（捕捉片段级退化类型）和动态提示（适应帧级强度变化）；3）标签感知监督机制提升静态提示表示在不同退化下的区分性。

Result: 大量实验表明，ORCANet在恢复质量、时间一致性和鲁棒性方面优于基于图像和视频的基线方法。

Conclusion: 本文提出的SEUD场景和ORCANet网络有效解决了视频修复中退化平滑演化的挑战，为视频全场景修复提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clean images from diverse unknown degradations using a single model. But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

*Ruiqiang Zhang,Hengyi Wang,Chang Liu,Guanjie Wang,Zehua Ma,Weiming Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeText是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过利用扩散变换器（DiT）模型的内在机制，提高文本渲染的精确度，特别是针对多行布局、密集排版和长尾脚本（如中文）的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型在开放域合成方面表现出色，但在精确文本渲染方面仍存在困难，尤其是对于多行布局、密集排版和长尾脚本（如中文）。现有解决方案通常需要昂贵的重新训练或严格的外部布局约束，这会降低美观性并限制灵活性。

Method: FreeText将问题分解为“在哪里写”和“写什么”。对于“在哪里写”，通过读取来自内生图像到文本注意力的标记级空间归因来定位书写区域，使用类似汇点的标记作为稳定的空间锚点，并通过拓扑感知细化生成高置信度掩码。对于“写什么”，引入频谱调制字形注入（SGMI），通过频域带通调制注入噪声对齐的字形先验，以增强字形结构并抑制语义泄漏（渲染概念而不是单词）。

Result: 在Qwen-Image、FLUX.1-dev和SD3变体上的广泛实验表明，在长文本基准测试、CVTG和我们的CLT-Bench中，文本可读性一致提升，同时很大程度上保留了语义对齐和美学质量，且推理开销适中。

Conclusion: FreeText通过利用DiT模型的内在机制，无需额外训练或外部约束，显著提升了文本渲染的精确度，特别是在复杂布局和长尾脚本上的表现优异，为文本到图像合成提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at open-domain synthesis but still struggle with precise text rendering, especially for multi-line layouts, dense typography, and long-tailed scripts such as Chinese. Prior solutions typically require costly retraining or rigid external layout constraints, which can degrade aesthetics and limit flexibility. We propose \textbf{FreeText}, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that improves text rendering by exploiting intrinsic mechanisms of \emph{Diffusion Transformer (DiT)} models. \textbf{FreeText} decomposes the problem into \emph{where to write} and \emph{what to write}. For \emph{where to write}, we localize writing regions by reading token-wise spatial attribution from endogenous image-to-text attention, using sink-like tokens as stable spatial anchors and topology-aware refinement to produce high-confidence masks. For \emph{what to write}, we introduce Spectral-Modulated Glyph Injection (SGMI), which injects a noise-aligned glyph prior with frequency-domain band-pass modulation to strengthen glyph structure and suppress semantic leakage (rendering the concept instead of the word). Extensive experiments on Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, and SD3 variants across longText-Benchmark, CVTG, and our CLT-Bench show consistent gains in text readability while largely preserving semantic alignment and aesthetic quality, with modest inference overhead.

TL;DR: VNS-SAM是针对SAM在视觉非显著性场景（低对比度前景背景）下分割性能不佳的问题提出的改进方法，通过两个新设计增强SAM对非显著性特征的感知能力，同时保持其零样本泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在视觉非显著性场景（前景背景对比度低）中表现不佳，现有方法难以捕捉准确轮廓，导致分割结果不理想。

Method: 提出VNS-SAM，通过Mask-Edge Token Interactive解码器和Non-Salient Feature Mining模块有效利用SAM的低层特征，仅需少量参数增加和计算开销。

Result: VNS-SAM在多种VNS分割任务中表现出优越性能，特别是在零样本设置下，展示了广泛的现实应用潜力。额外参数可在4小时内优化完成。

Conclusion: VNS-SAM成功提升了SAM在视觉非显著性场景下的分割能力，同时保持了原有的零样本泛化性，具有实际可行性和应用价值。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its remarkable zero-shot segmentation capabilities, has garnered significant attention in the community. Nevertheless, its performance is challenged when dealing with what we refer to as visually non-salient scenarios, where there is low contrast between the foreground and background. In these cases, existing methods often cannot capture accurate contours and fail to produce promising segmentation results. In this paper, we propose Visually Non-Salient SAM (VNS-SAM), aiming to enhance SAM's perception of visually non-salient scenarios while preserving its original zero-shot generalizability. We achieve this by effectively exploiting SAM's low-level features through two designs: Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining module. These designs help the SAM decoder gain a deeper understanding of non-salient characteristics with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of VNS-SAM can be optimized within 4 hours, demonstrating its feasibility and practicality. In terms of data, we established VNS-SEG, a unified dataset for various VNS scenarios, with more than 35K images, in contrast to previous single-task adaptations. It is designed to make the model learn more robust VNS features and comprehensively benchmark the model's segmentation performance and generalizability on VNS scenarios. Extensive experiments across various VNS segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VNS-SAM, particularly under zero-shot settings, highlighting its potential for broad real-world applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出DynaDrag方法，采用预测-移动框架实现像素级拖拽式图像编辑，通过迭代运动预测和运动监督避免传统方法中的跟踪失败和编辑质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拖拽式图像编辑方法存在跟踪失败、目标图像与源图像差异过大、中间点不合理导致编辑性差等问题，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出DynaDrag方法，采用预测-移动框架，迭代执行运动预测（预测控制点移动位置）和运动监督（拖动控制点），并动态调整有效控制点。

Result: 在人脸和人体数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有工作。

Conclusion: DynaDrag是首个基于预测-移动框架的拖拽方法，能有效解决传统方法的问题，提升图像编辑质量。

Abstract: To achieve pixel-level image manipulation, drag-style image editing which edits images using points or trajectories as conditions is attracting widespread attention. Most previous methods follow move-and-track framework, in which miss tracking and ambiguous tracking are unavoidable challenging issues. Other methods under different frameworks suffer from various problems like the huge gap between source image and target edited image as well as unreasonable intermediate point which can lead to low editability. To avoid these problems, we propose DynaDrag, the first dragging method under predict-and-move framework. In DynaDrag, Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision are performed iteratively. In each iteration, Motion Prediction first predicts where the handle points should move, and then Motion Supervision drags them accordingly. We also propose to dynamically adjust the valid handle points to further improve the performance. Experiments on face and human datasets showcase the superiority over previous works.

TL;DR: SlingBAG Pro是一种基于点云迭代的3D光声成像重建算法，适用于不规则几何换能器阵列，相比传统方法具有更高的重建质量和更快的重建速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不规则几何换能器阵列在3D光声成像中的重建挑战，传统迭代算法存在计算复杂、内存需求大、重建时间长的问题。

Method: 基于SlingBAG方法的点云迭代概念，采用分层优化策略，结合零梯度滤波和逐步增加的时间采样率，快速去除冗余空间点云并加速收敛。

Result: 相比原始SlingBAG算法，在不规则阵列几何下实现点云3D PA重建速度提升高达2.2倍，通过仿真和体内小鼠实验验证。

Conclusion: SlingBAG Pro算法能够在不规则阵列配置下保持高质量重建，显著减少重建时间，为临床3D光声成像应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is gaining increasing attention in clinical applications. To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries. The proposed method is validated through both simulation and in vivo mouse experiments, and the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG_Pro.

Method: 使用MS COCO数据集构建包含96000个数据点的数据集，采用五种生成器（Stable Diffusion 3、Stable Diffusion 2.1、SDXL、DALL-E 3和MidJourney v6）生成合成图像，并设计两个分类任务：图像真实性分类和生成模型识别。

Conclusion: 该工作为解决AI生成图像检测问题提供了重要的数据集资源，有助于推动相关领域的研究发展，应对生成技术带来的挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI systems like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and MidJourney have fundamentally changed how synthetic images are created. These tools drive innovation but also enable the spread of misleading content, false information, and manipulated media. As generated images become harder to distinguish from photographs, detecting them has become an urgent priority. To combat this challenge, We release MS COCOAI, a novel dataset for AI generated image detection consisting of 96000 real and synthetic datapoints, built using the MS COCO dataset. To generate synthetic images, we use five generators: Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, DALL-E 3, and MidJourney v6. Based on the dataset, we propose two tasks: (1) classifying images as real or generated, and (2) identifying which model produced a given synthetic image.

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个全面的多任务基准测试，用于评估统一多模态模型的世界知识应用能力，包含1050个手动标注的问题，涵盖21个主题和6种推理类型，并提出确定性检查表评估协议以提高评估可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试存在局限性，仅提供孤立的单任务评估，诊断能力有限。需要更全面的基准来评估UMMs在跨任务应用世界知识的能力。

Method: 提出AEGIS基准测试，包含视觉理解、生成、编辑和交错生成等多任务；开发确定性检查表评估协议，用原子化的"是/否"判断替代模糊的提示式评分。

Result: 实验显示大多数UMMs存在严重的世界知识缺陷，性能在复杂推理任务中显著下降；简单的插件推理模块可以部分缓解这些弱点。

Conclusion: 基于世界知识的推理是UMMs发展的关键前沿，需要进一步研究来提升模型的世界知识应用能力。

Abstract: The capability of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) to apply world knowledge across diverse tasks remains a critical, unresolved challenge. Existing benchmarks fall short, offering only siloed, single-task evaluations with limited diagnostic power. To bridge this gap, we propose AEGIS (\emph{i.e.}, \textbf{A}ssessing \textbf{E}diting, \textbf{G}eneration, \textbf{I}nterpretation-Understanding for \textbf{S}uper-intelligence), a comprehensive multi-task benchmark covering visual understanding, generation, editing, and interleaved generation. AEGIS comprises 1,050 challenging, manually-annotated questions spanning 21 topics (including STEM, humanities, daily life, etc.) and 6 reasoning types. To concretely evaluate the performance of UMMs in world knowledge scope without ambiguous metrics, we further propose Deterministic Checklist-based Evaluation (DCE), a protocol that replaces ambiguous prompt-based scoring with atomic ``Y/N'' judgments, to enhance evaluation reliability. Our extensive experiments reveal that most UMMs exhibit severe world knowledge deficits and that performance degrades significantly with complex reasoning. Additionally, simple plug-in reasoning modules can partially mitigate these vulnerabilities, highlighting a promising direction for future research. These results highlight the importance of world-knowledge-based reasoning as a critical frontier for UMMs.

Abstract: Visual perception plays a pivotal role in enabling autonomous behavior, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative to complex multi-sensor systems. However, robust segmentation remains a challenge in complex scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes a cascaded convolutional neural network integrated with a novel Global Information Guidance Module. This module is designed to effectively fuse low-level texture details with high-level semantic features across multiple layers, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of single-scale feature extraction. This architectural innovation significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, particularly in visually cluttered or blurred environments where traditional methods often fail. Experimental evaluations on benchmark image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior precision, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of the approach and its promising potential for deployment in practical robotic applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的框架GranAlign，通过粒度感知对齐解决零样本视频时刻检索中的语义粒度不匹配问题，在三个主要基准测试中实现了新的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零样本视频时刻检索的主要挑战在于文本查询和视觉内容之间的语义粒度不匹配。现有方法虽然利用了高质量的预训练知识，但未能平衡不同模态提供的语义粒度，导致检索不准确。

Method: 提出了GranAlign框架，包含两个互补技术：基于粒度的查询重写（生成不同语义粒度的查询）和查询感知的标题生成（将查询意图嵌入视频内容）。通过将多级查询与查询无关和查询感知的标题配对，有效解决语义不匹配问题。

Result: 在三个主要基准测试（QVHighlights、Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions）上均实现了新的最先进性能，特别是在具有挑战性的QVHighlights数据集上mAP@avg提升了3.23%。

Conclusion: GranAlign框架通过粒度感知对齐有效解决了零样本视频时刻检索中的语义粒度不匹配问题，证明了无需训练的方法在跨模态对齐任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Zero-shot video moment retrieval (ZVMR) is the task of localizing a temporal moment within an untrimmed video using a natural language query without relying on task-specific training data. The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches. As a result, our method sets a new state-of-the-art across all three major benchmarks (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions), with a notable 3.23% mAP@avg improvement on the challenging QVHighlights dataset.

Conclusion: SafeMo能够有效生成安全的人体运动，保持自然过渡，在安全性和性能之间取得良好平衡，为可信赖的运动生成提供了新解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-motion (T2M) generation with diffusion backbones achieves strong realism and alignment. Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

Motivation: RGB-IR多模态感知在复杂物理环境中具有重要应用价值，但由于模态特征不对称导致的信息密度和特征质量差异，会引入持续的优化偏差，使得训练过程过度关注主导模态，阻碍有效的跨模态融合。

Method: 提出模态主导指标（MDI）来量化模态主导程度，基于MDI开发了MDACL框架，包含分层跨模态指导（HCG）来增强特征对齐，以及对抗均衡正则化（AER）来平衡融合过程中的优化动态。

Conclusion: 该研究通过量化模态主导现象并开发相应的学习框架，成功解决了RGB-IR多模态检测中的优化偏差问题，为多模态感知系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: RGB-Infrared (RGB-IR) multimodal perception is fundamental to embodied multimedia systems operating in complex physical environments. Although recent cross-modal fusion methods have advanced RGB-IR detection, the optimization dynamics caused by asymmetric modality characteristics remain underexplored. In practice, disparities in information density and feature quality introduce persistent optimization bias, leading training to overemphasize a dominant modality and hindering effective fusion. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose the Modality Dominance Index (MDI), which measures modality dominance by jointly modeling feature entropy and gradient contribution. Based on MDI, we develop a Modality Dominance-Aware Cross-modal Learning (MDACL) framework that regulates cross-modal optimization. MDACL incorporates Hierarchical Cross-modal Guidance (HCG) to enhance feature alignment and Adversarial Equilibrium Regularization (AER) to balance optimization dynamics during fusion. Extensive experiments on three RGB-IR benchmarks demonstrate that MDACL effectively mitigates optimization bias and achieves SOTA performance.

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性，特别是在AI-TOD数据集上将DINO基线的AP提升了1.2%。

Conclusion: TOLF框架通过流式误差建模和不确定性引导优化，有效提升了微小物体检测的鲁棒性和性能，解决了噪声过拟合问题。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in generic object detection, a persistent performance gap remains for tiny objects compared to normal-scale objects. We demonstrate that tiny objects are highly sensitive to annotation noise, where optimizing strict localization objectives risks noise overfitting. To address this, we propose Tiny Object Localization with Flows (TOLF), a noise-robust localization framework leveraging normalizing flows for flexible error modeling and uncertainty-guided optimization. Our method captures complex, non-Gaussian prediction distributions through flow-based error modeling, enabling robust learning under noisy supervision. An uncertainty-aware gradient modulation mechanism further suppresses learning from high-uncertainty, noise-prone samples, mitigating overfitting while stabilizing training. Extensive experiments across three datasets validate our approach's effectiveness. Especially, TOLF boosts the DINO baseline by 1.2% AP on the AI-TOD dataset.

Secondly, we propose a fast tracking method for medical rehabilitation scenarios with multiple-person interference, which requires less than 1ms for tracking for a single frame. Additionally, we modify SmoothNet for real-time posture estimation, effectively reducing pose estimation errors and restoring the patient's true motion state, making it visually smoother.

Motivation: 解决室管膜瘤术前MRI缺乏语义洞察力的问题，现有方法无法在推理时利用术后文本数据这一特权信息。

Method: 采用超图学习和特权信息学习框架，通过Severed Graph策略使用共享编码器处理教师图（含术后信息）和学生图（仅术前数据），通过双流蒸馏让学生图从视觉特征中学习语义社区结构。

Result: 在311名患者的多中心队列中验证，达到最先进的诊断准确性和生存分层效果。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将专家知识转移到术前场景，利用历史术后数据指导新患者诊断，无需在推理时使用文本信息。

Abstract: Preoperative prognosis of Ependymoma is critical for treatment planning but challenging due to the lack of semantic insights in MRI compared to post-operative surgical reports. Existing multimodal methods fail to leverage this privileged text data when it is unavailable during inference. To bridge this gap, we propose HyperPriv-EPN, a hypergraph-based Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework. We introduce a Severed Graph Strategy, utilizing a shared encoder to process both a Teacher graph (enriched with privileged post-surgery information) and a Student graph (restricted to pre-operation data). Through dual-stream distillation, the Student learns to hallucinate semantic community structures from visual features alone. Validated on a multi-center cohort of 311 patients, HyperPriv-EPN achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and survival stratification. This effectively transfers expert knowledge to the preoperative setting, unlocking the value of historical post-operative data to guide the diagnosis of new patients without requiring text at inference.

TL;DR: 该研究利用图像深度学习技术，通过预训练的ResNet、VGG、DenseNet和ViT架构，开发了马铃薯芽检测和货架期预测模型。DenseNet在芽检测中达到98.03%准确率，货架期预测在粗分类（2-5类）下准确率超过89.83%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决马铃薯储存期间的质量监控挑战，包括芽检测、重量损失估计和货架期预测，为自动化分拣和库存系统提供非侵入式解决方案。

Method: 在受控温湿度条件下收集200天的图像和重量数据，使用预训练的ResNet、VGG、DenseNet和ViT架构设计二元分类器（芽检测）和多类预测器（重量损失和货架期预测）。

Result: DenseNet在芽检测中表现最佳（98.03%准确率）；货架期预测在粗分类（2-5类）下准确率高（>89.83%），细分类（6-8类）因视觉差异细微和数据有限而准确率下降。

Conclusion: 图像深度学习为马铃薯质量评估提供了经济高效的非破坏性方法，支持库存管理和减少食品浪费。未来需开发适用于多样马铃薯品种和储存条件的通用模型以提升适应性。

Abstract: Image-based deep learning provides a non-invasive, scalable solution for monitoring potato quality during storage, addressing key challenges such as sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction. In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability. Overall, this approach offers a cost-effective, non-destructive method for quality assessment, supporting efficiency and sustainability in potato storage and distribution.

Abstract: Reliable building height estimation is essential for various urban applications. Spaceborne SAR tomography (TomoSAR) provides weather-independent, side-looking observations that capture facade-level structure, offering a promising alternative to conventional optical methods. However, TomoSAR point clouds often suffer from noise, anisotropic point distributions, and data voids on incoherent surfaces, all of which hinder accurate height reconstruction. To address these challenges, we introduce a learning-based framework for converting raw TomoSAR points into high-resolution building height maps. Our dual-topology network alternates between a point branch that models irregular scatterer features and a grid branch that enforces spatial consistency. By jointly processing these representations, the network denoises the input points and inpaints missing regions to produce continuous height estimates. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of concept for large-scale urban height mapping directly from TomoSAR point clouds. Extensive experiments on data from Munich and Berlin validate the effectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we demonstrate that our framework can be extended to incorporate optical satellite imagery, further enhancing reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: 通过选择性文本标记移除和广义对比解码，CRoPS有效缓解了LVLM的幻觉问题，为提升模型可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the rapid success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), a persistent challenge is their tendency to generate hallucinated content, undermining reliability in real-world use. Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources. Together, these ideas form CRoPS, a training-free hallucination mitigation framework that improves CHAIR scores by 20% and achieves consistent gains across six benchmarks and three LVLM families, outperforming state-of-the-art training-free methods.

Abstract: Humans excel at forecasting the future dynamics of a scene given just a single image. Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 适度空间下采样可有效提升各向同性网络的移动端适用性，为轻量化深度学习在图像处理中的应用提供新思路。

Abstract: In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.

Method: 开发DomainSAT轻量级工具箱，集成代表性偏移检测算法；研究输入级数据偏移和输出级预测行为；引入基于置信度的无标签性能退化指标。

Result: 输入数据偏移检测能识别分布变化并提供早期诊断信号，但不总是对应实际性能退化；基于置信度的指标与性能退化密切相关，可作为输入偏移检测的有效补充。

Conclusion: 结合输入数据偏移检测和输出置信度指标能够更可靠地检测和解释VLMs在数据偏移下的性能退化，为数字病理学中基础模型的可靠性监控提供了实用框架。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have demonstrated strong potential in medical image analysis and disease diagnosis. However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift. These findings provide a practical and complementary framework for monitoring the reliability of foundation models in digital pathology.

Motivation: 深度神经网络在制造业质量检测中应用广泛，但在再制造等变化较大的场景中，检测产品和缺陷模式经常变化，部署的模型需要频繁适应新条件，这构成了持续学习问题。需要计算高效的训练过程，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Result: 该方法在不同质量检测问题上能够达到端到端训练的性能水平，同时使用显著更少的可训练参数。此外，减少了灾难性遗忘，并提高了对新产品类型或缺陷的泛化鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MLFF方法在制造业视觉质量检测的持续学习场景中表现出色，既保持了性能又提高了计算效率，为解决动态环境下的模型适应问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks show great potential for automating various visual quality inspection tasks in manufacturing. However, their applicability is limited in more volatile scenarios, such as remanufacturing, where the inspected products and defect patterns often change. In such settings, deployed models require frequent adaptation to novel conditions, effectively posing a continual learning problem. To enable quick adaptation, the necessary training processes must be computationally efficient while still avoiding effects like catastrophic forgetting. This work presents a multi-level feature fusion (MLFF) approach that aims to improve both aspects simultaneously by utilizing representations from different depths of a pretrained network. We show that our approach is able to match the performance of end-to-end training for different quality inspection problems while using significantly less trainable parameters. Furthermore, it reduces catastrophic forgetting and improves generalization robustness to new product types or defects.

Result: 使用最先进的后端模型（GPT-5.2和Gemini-3 Pro），完整流程与讲师评分相比平均绝对差异约8分，偏差低，手动审核触发率约17%。消融实验显示简化提示和移除参考答案会显著降低准确性并引入系统性过高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和参考答案基础是确保评分准确性的关键要素，提出的多阶段工作流能够可靠地自动化手写工程测验评分。

Abstract: Handwritten STEM exams capture open-ended reasoning and diagrams, but manual grading is slow and difficult to scale. We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports. We evaluate the frozen pipeline in a clean-room protocol on a held-out real course quiz in Slovenian, including hand-drawn circuit schematics. With state-of-the-art backends (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3 Pro), the full pipeline achieves $\approx$8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades with low bias and an estimated manual-review trigger rate of $\approx$17% at $D_{\max}=40$. Ablations show that trivial prompting and removing the reference solution substantially degrade accuracy and introduce systematic over-grading, confirming that structured prompting and reference grounding are essential.

Abstract: Left ventricle (LV) segmentation is critical for clinical quantification and diagnosis of cardiac images. In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images. LNU-Net is derived from layer normalization (LN) U-Net architecture, while IBU-Net is derived from the instance-batch normalized (IB) U-Net for medical image segmentation. The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing. Our dataset that contains 805 MRI images regarding the left ventricle from 45 patients is used for evaluation. We experimentally evaluate the results of the proposed approaches outperforming the dice coefficient and the average perpendicular distance than other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 该方法为从不完整数据中实现结构化3D理解提供了有吸引力的解决方案，通过统一表示和优化策略实现了更有效的形状补全。

Abstract: Structured shape completion recovers missing geometry as primitives rather than as unstructured points, which enables primitive-based surface reconstruction. Instead of following the prevailing cascade, we rethink how primitives and points should interact, and find it more effective to decode primitives in a dedicated pathway that attends to shared shape features. Following this principle, we present UniCo, which in a single feed-forward pass predicts a set of primitives with complete geometry, semantics, and inlier membership. To drive this unified representation, we introduce primitive proxies, learnable queries that are contextualized to produce assembly-ready outputs. To ensure consistent optimization, our training strategy couples primitives and points with online target updates. Across synthetic and real-world benchmarks with four independent assembly solvers, UniCo consistently outperforms recent baselines, lowering Chamfer distance by up to 50% and improving normal consistency by up to 7%. These results establish an attractive recipe for structured 3D understanding from incomplete data. Project page: https://unico-completion.github.io.

Conclusion: AdaGaR通过频率自适应和时序连续性约束，有效解决了动态3D场景重建中的关键挑战，在多个任务上展现了优越性能。

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos requires simultaneously capturing high-frequency appearance details and temporally continuous motion. Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.

Abstract: Machine learning offers potential solutions to current issues in industrial systems in areas such as quality control and predictive maintenance, but also faces unique barriers in industrial applications. An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.

*Nicholas A. Pape*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文将Yahtzee游戏建模为MDP，使用多种策略梯度方法训练自博弈智能体，发现A2C在固定训练预算下表现最稳健，接近最优动态规划解，但所有模型在长期信用分配和探索方面仍存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Yahtzee游戏具有随机性、组合结构和延迟奖励的特点，是中等规模强化学习的理想基准。虽然单人游戏可用动态规划求解，但多人游戏难以处理，需要近似方法。

Method: 将Yahtzee建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用REINFORCE、A2C和PPO等策略梯度方法训练自博弈智能体，采用多头网络架构，并对特征编码、动作编码、架构、回报估计器和熵正则化进行消融研究。

Result: 在固定训练预算下，REINFORCE和PPO对超参数敏感且未能达到接近最优性能，而A2C在各种设置下都能稳健训练。最佳智能体在10万局评估游戏中获得中位数241.78分，接近最优DP分数254.59的5.0%以内，上部分奖励和Yahtzee达成率分别为24.9%和34.1%。

Conclusion: 所有模型都难以学习上部分奖励策略，过度依赖四骰组合，突显了长期信用分配和探索方面的持续挑战。

Abstract: Yahtzee is a classic dice game with a stochastic, combinatorial structure and delayed rewards, making it an interesting mid-scale RL benchmark. While an optimal policy for solitaire Yahtzee can be computed using dynamic programming methods, multiplayer is intractable, motivating approximation methods. We formulate Yahtzee as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and train self-play agents using various policy gradient methods: REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all using a multi-headed network with a shared trunk. We ablate feature and action encodings, architecture, return estimators, and entropy regularization to understand their impact on learning. Under a fixed training budget, REINFORCE and PPO prove sensitive to hyperparameters and fail to reach near-optimal performance, whereas A2C trains robustly across a range of settings. Our agent attains a median score of 241.78 points over 100,000 evaluation games, within 5.0\% of the optimal DP score of 254.59, achieving the upper section bonus and Yahtzee at rates of 24.9\% and 34.1\%, respectively. All models struggle to learn the upper bonus strategy, overindexing on four-of-a-kind's, highlighting persistent long-horizon credit-assignment and exploration challenges.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为"breaker token"的攻击方法，通过利用分词器移植过程中的漏洞，在模型组合时植入恶意特征，破坏基础模型的生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着开源LLM生态系统中模型组合技术（如权重合并、推测解码等）的普及，分词器移植成为跨模型家族应用这些方法的关键前提。然而，这一关键互操作性步骤存在供应链安全漏洞。

Method: 通过双目标优化问题形式化攻击，利用系数重用的几何特性，设计一个在供体模型中功能惰性但在移植到基础模型后能可靠重建为高显著性恶意特征的单一"breaker token"。使用稀疏求解器实例化攻击，实现训练免费且能逃避异常检测的光谱模仿。

Result: 攻击成功实现了对基础模型生成能力的破坏，同时供体模型的效用与正常行为在统计上无法区分。攻击具有结构性持久性，能够抵抗微调和权重合并。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了模块化AI组合流程中的隐藏风险，强调了在模型组合技术广泛应用背景下加强安全性的必要性。

Abstract: The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single "breaker token" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IMBWatch是一个基于时空图神经网络的框架，用于大规模检测非法按摩店，通过分析在线广告、商业记录和评论等开源情报构建动态图，有效识别人口贩运和剥削网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法按摩店(IMBs)以合法健康服务为掩护进行人口贩运和剥削，传统检测方法反应迟钝且难以揭示其运营网络，需要更有效的技术手段。

Method: 构建时空图神经网络(ST-GNN)，从在线广告、商业许可证和众包评论中提取异构实体(企业、别名、电话号码、位置)，使用图卷积和时间注意力机制建模网络演化模式。

Result: 在美国多个城市的真实数据集上，IMBWatch在准确率和F1分数上优于基线模型，并提供更好的可解释性，支持主动干预。

Conclusion: IMBWatch框架具有可扩展性和适应性，可应用于其他非法领域，已发布匿名数据和开源代码支持可重复研究。

Abstract: Illicit Massage Businesses (IMBs) are a covert and persistent form of organized exploitation that operate under the facade of legitimate wellness services while facilitating human trafficking, sexual exploitation, and coerced labor. Detecting IMBs is difficult due to encoded digital advertisements, frequent changes in personnel and locations, and the reuse of shared infrastructure such as phone numbers and addresses. Traditional approaches, including community tips and regulatory inspections, are largely reactive and ineffective at revealing the broader operational networks traffickers rely on.
  To address these challenges, we introduce IMBWatch, a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) framework for large-scale IMB detection. IMBWatch constructs dynamic graphs from open-source intelligence, including scraped online advertisements, business license records, and crowdsourced reviews. Nodes represent heterogeneous entities such as businesses, aliases, phone numbers, and locations, while edges capture spatio-temporal and relational patterns, including co-location, repeated phone usage, and synchronized advertising. The framework combines graph convolutional operations with temporal attention mechanisms to model the evolution of IMB networks over time and space, capturing patterns such as intercity worker movement, burner phone rotation, and coordinated advertising surges.
  Experiments on real-world datasets from multiple U.S. cities show that IMBWatch outperforms baseline models, achieving higher accuracy and F1 scores. Beyond performance gains, IMBWatch offers improved interpretability, providing actionable insights to support proactive and targeted interventions. The framework is scalable, adaptable to other illicit domains, and released with anonymized data and open-source code to support reproducible research.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种渐近置信度的最佳臂识别新方法，通过放松严格精确误差控制要求，在长实验周期下实现更优的样本效率和灵活性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BAI方法在实际应用中存在局限性，严格的精确误差控制需要使用宽松的尾不等式和/或参数限制，难以处理弱信号、高显著性要求和后实验推断需求等现实场景。

Method: 开发了基于臂索引的渐近随时有效置信序列，设计新的BAI算法，灵活整合协变量进行方差缩减，在完全非参数设置下确保近似误差控制。

Result: 在温和收敛假设下，提供了样本复杂度的渐近界，最坏情况样本复杂度与高斯BAI在精确误差保证和已知方差下的最佳情况样本复杂度相匹配。实验表明该方法在保持误差控制的同时降低了平均样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的渐近框架能够更好地处理灵活的非参数结果分布，充分利用个体层面上下文，在现实场景中实现更优的性能。

Abstract: In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在方程发现中表现出潜力，但其输出对提示语高度敏感（指令脆弱性），静态提示无法适应多步生成过程的演化状态，导致模型停留在次优解。

Method: 提出NeuroSymBO方法，将提示工程重新定义为序列决策问题。该方法维护离散推理策略库，使用贝叶斯优化根据数值反馈在每个步骤选择最优指令。

Result: 在PDE发现基准测试中，自适应指令选择显著优于固定提示，实现了更高的恢复率和更简洁的解决方案。

Conclusion: 动态指令选择策略能有效解决LLM的指令脆弱性问题，提升方程发现的性能表现。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for equation discovery, yet their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, a phenomenon we term instruction brittleness. Static prompts cannot adapt to the evolving state of a multi-step generation process, causing models to plateau at suboptimal solutions. To address this, we propose NeuroSymBO, which reframes prompt engineering as a sequential decision problem. Our method maintains a discrete library of reasoning strategies and uses Bayesian Optimization to select the optimal instruction at each step based on numerical feedback. Experiments on PDE discovery benchmarks show that adaptive instruction selection significantly outperforms fixed prompts, achieving higher recovery rates with more parsimonious solutions.

TL;DR: GRL-SNAM是一个基于几何强化学习的框架，用于未知环境中的同步导航与建图，通过局部能量景观和哈密顿优化实现无全局地图的高质量导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在无地图环境中多智能体协同导航与建图的挑战，传统方法需要构建全局地图，而GRL-SNAM仅依赖局部感知实现高效导航。

Method: 将路径导航和建图建模为动态最短路径搜索过程，使用受控哈密顿优化：将感知输入转化为局部能量景观编码可达性、障碍约束，通过更新哈密顿量分阶段演化感知、规划和重配置策略。

Result: 在2D导航任务中评估，相比局部反应基线和全局策略学习方法，GRL-SNAM保持安全距离、泛化到未见布局，通过局部能量优化实现高质量导航，无需广泛全局建图。

Conclusion: 几何强化学习通过更新哈密顿量实现高质量导航，仅需最小化探索和局部能量优化，而非构建全局地图，为未知环境导航提供了新思路。

Abstract: We present GRL-SNAM, a geometric reinforcement learning framework for Simultaneous Navigation and Mapping(SNAM) in unknown environments. A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping. The code is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/CVC-Lab/GRL-SNAM}{Github}.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法通常假设马尔可夫性，但在实际应用中状态过程往往是非马尔可夫的。本文旨在扩展强化学习理论到非马尔可夫环境，为实际应用提供理论支持。

Method: 使用线性函数逼近方法，在非马尔可夫过程中进行策略评估和Q-learning分析。特别地，当基函数基于量化映射选择时，证明了算法的收敛性。

Result: 证明了在适当遍历性条件下，策略评估算法能够收敛到辅助马尔可夫决策过程的贝尔曼算子的固定点。对于Q-learning，在特定基函数选择下也能保证收敛。

Conclusion: 本文为非马尔可夫环境下的强化学习提供了理论保证，特别是在部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程中，通过有限记忆变量作为状态表示，推导出了学习算法极限的显式误差界。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning methods with linear function approximation under non-Markov state and cost processes. We first consider the policy evaluation method and show that the algorithm converges under suitable ergodicity conditions on the underlying non-Markov processes. Furthermore, we show that the limit corresponds to the fixed point of a joint operator composed of an orthogonal projection and the Bellman operator of an auxiliary \emph{Markov} decision process.
  For Q-learning with linear function approximation, as in the Markov setting, convergence is not guaranteed in general. We show, however, that for the special case where the basis functions are chosen based on quantization maps, the convergence can be shown under similar ergodicity conditions. Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.

Abstract: This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets. These findings contribute to evidence-based traffic management and suggest future directions for severity prediction research.

Abstract: Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision making by formulating offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers.

Conclusion: Sequential RC在保持传统RC简单高效的同时，为高维动态系统提供了更好的可扩展性，为科学和工程应用中的实时、节能预测提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional spatiotemporal systems remains computationally challenging for recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) models due to gradient-based training and memory bottlenecks. Reservoir Computing (RC) mitigates these challenges by replacing backpropagation with fixed recurrent layers and a convex readout optimization, yet conventional RC architectures still scale poorly with input dimensionality. We introduce a Sequential Reservoir Computing (Sequential RC) architecture that decomposes a large reservoir into a series of smaller, interconnected reservoirs. This design reduces memory and computational costs while preserving long-term temporal dependencies. Using both low-dimensional chaotic systems (Lorenz63) and high-dimensional physical simulations (2D vorticity and shallow-water equations), Sequential RC achieves 15-25% longer valid forecast horizons, 20-30% lower error metrics (SSIM, RMSE), and up to three orders of magnitude lower training cost compared to LSTM and standard RNN baselines. The results demonstrate that Sequential RC maintains the simplicity and efficiency of conventional RC while achieving superior scalability for high-dimensional dynamical systems. This approach provides a practical path toward real-time, energy-efficient forecasting in scientific and engineering applications.

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用脂肪肝患者数据构建预测模型，采用观察窗口和预测窗口模拟临床实际应用，训练XGBoost模型并与FIB-4评分进行性能比较。

Result: 机器学习模型在所有预测时间窗口均优于FIB-4，1年、2年、3年预测的AUC分别为0.81、0.73、0.69，而FIB-4对应为0.71、0.63、0.57。

Conclusion: 基于常规电子健康记录数据的机器学习模型在早期肝硬化预测方面显著优于传统FIB-4评分，可作为临床决策支持工具实现主动预防和管理。

Abstract: Objective: Develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting incident liver cirrhosis one, two, and three years prior to diagnosis using routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data, and to benchmark their performance against the FIB-4 score. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.

Conclusion: 该框架证明简单但智能分配的重复编码能够实现细粒度语义保护，这一优势是传统编码（如LDPC或Reed-Solomon）无法达到的，挑战了传统信道编码范式，为下一代语义感知网络提供了实用途径。

Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of preserving semantic meaning in communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.

Conclusion: SSI-GAN在尖峰信号分类任务中显著优于所有基线方法，为实际场景中的病毒神经趋向性检测提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Mosquitos are the main transmissive agents of arboviral diseases. Manual classification of their neuronal spike patterns is very labor-intensive and expensive. Most available deep learning solutions require fully labeled spike datasets and highly preprocessed neuronal signals. This reduces the feasibility of mass adoption in actual field scenarios. To address the scarcity of labeled data problems, we propose a new Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture that we call the Semi-supervised Swin-Inspired GAN (SSI-GAN). The Swin-inspired, shifted-window discriminator, together with a transformer-based generator, is used to classify neuronal spike trains and, consequently, detect viral neurotropism. We use a multi-head self-attention model in a flat, window-based transformer discriminator that learns to capture sparser high-frequency spike features. Using just 1 to 3% labeled data, SSI-GAN was trained with more than 15 million spike samples collected at five-time post-infection and recording classification into Zika-infected, dengue-infected, or uninfected categories. Hyperparameters were optimized using the Bayesian Optuna framework, and performance for robustness was validated under fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation. SSI-GAN reached 99.93% classification accuracy on the third day post-infection with only 3% labeled data. It maintained high accuracy across all stages of infection with just 1% supervision. This shows a 97-99% reduction in manual labeling effort relative to standard supervised approaches at the same performance level.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种资源高效的数据中心框架，通过特征工程使心律失常数据线性可分，实现了98.44%的诊断准确率和8.54KB的模型大小，适用于资源受限的边缘设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病特别是心律失常是全球主要死亡原因，需要通过医疗物联网进行连续监测，但现有深度学习方法的计算开销过大，不适合资源受限的边缘设备。

Method: 整合时频小波分解和图形理论结构描述符（如PageRank中心性），构建混合特征空间，并使用互信息和递归消除进行特征优化，最终采用超轻量级线性分类器。

Result: 在MIT-BIH和INCART数据集上验证，达到98.44%的诊断准确率，模型大小仅8.54KB，分类推理延迟0.46μs，每搏处理管道52ms，实现实时操作。

Conclusion: 该框架相比压缩模型（如KD-Light的25KB、96.32%准确率）实现了数量级效率提升，推动了无电池心脏传感器的发展。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, particularly arrhythmias, remain a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating continuous monitoring via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $μ$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation. These outcomes provide an order-of-magnitude efficiency gain over compressed models, such as KD-Light (25 KB, 96.32% accuracy), advancing battery-less cardiac sensors.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of photorealistic generative models has made it increasingly important to attribute the origin of synthetic content, moving beyond binary real or fake detection toward identifying the specific model that produced a given image. We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了对抗性图提示（AGP）框架，将对抗学习集成到图提示中，以提高预训练GNN模型在下游任务中的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调（PEFT）方法在面对图拓扑和节点特征的噪声和攻击时表现出显著的脆弱性，需要开发更鲁棒的图微调方法。

Method: AGP将问题建模为min-max优化问题，采用交替优化方案：内层使用JointPGD算法生成强对抗噪声，外层通过节点提示模块学习最优提示来抵消对抗噪声。

Result: 理论分析表明AGP能同时处理图拓扑和节点噪声，实验验证了该方法在多个基准任务上的鲁棒性和有效性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AGP是一个通用框架，可与各种预训练GNN模型结合，显著提升下游任务的鲁棒性，为解决图噪声问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method has emerged as a dominant paradigm for adapting pre-trained GNN models to downstream tasks. However, existing PEFT methods usually exhibit significant vulnerability to various noise and attacks on graph topology and node attributes/features. To address this issue, for the first time, we propose integrating adversarial learning into graph prompting and develop a novel Adversarial Graph Prompting (AGP) framework to achieve robust graph fine-tuning. Our AGP has two key aspects. First, we propose the general problem formulation of AGP as a min-max optimization problem and develop an alternating optimization scheme to solve it. For inner maximization, we propose Joint Projected Gradient Descent (JointPGD) algorithm to generate strong adversarial noise. For outer minimization, we employ a simple yet effective module to learn the optimal node prompts to counteract the adversarial noise. Second, we demonstrate that the proposed AGP can theoretically address both graph topology and node noise. This confirms the versatility and robustness of our AGP fine-tuning method across various graph noise. Note that, the proposed AGP is a general method that can be integrated with various pre-trained GNN models to enhance their robustness on the downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark tasks validate the robustness and effectiveness of AGP method compared to state-of-the-art methods.

*Pritish Saha,Chandrav Rajbangshi,Rudra Goyal,Mohit Goyal,Anurag Deo,Biswajit Roy,Ningthoujam Dhanachandra Singh,Raxit Goswami,Amitava Das*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRIT是一种动态、曲率感知的LoRA改进方法，通过K-FAC预条件梯度、定期重投影到Fisher主特征方向以及自适应调整有效秩，在减少46%可训练参数的同时保持或超越LoRA和QLoRA的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoRA和QLoRA方法在固定、随机方向的低秩子空间中进行一阶优化，忽略了局部损失曲率，导致有效更新预算增加和沿弱约束方向的漂移放大。

Method: GRIT保留了LoRA参数化，但引入了三个关键改进：(1)使用K-FAC作为自然梯度代理在秩空间预条件梯度；(2)定期将低秩基重投影到主导Fisher特征方向以抑制漂移；(3)根据谱自适应调整有效秩，使容量集中在信号所在区域。

Result: 在LLaMA骨干网络上的指令跟随、理解和推理基准测试中，GRIT平均减少46%的可训练参数（各任务范围为25-80%），同时匹配或超越LoRA和QLoRA性能，在不同提示风格和数据混合下没有实际质量损失。

Conclusion: GRIT相比强PEFT优化器基线（Orthogonal-LoRA、IA3、DoRA、Eff-FT、Shampoo）具有更低的漂移和更好的更新与保留权衡边界，通过曲率调制幂律建模遗忘现象。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is the default way to adapt LLMs, but widely used LoRA and QLoRA are largely geometry-agnostic: they optimize in fixed, randomly oriented low-rank subspaces with first-order descent, mostly ignoring local loss curvature. This can inflate the effective update budget and amplify drift along weakly constrained directions. We introduce GRIT, a dynamic, curvature-aware LoRA procedure that preserves the LoRA parameterization but: (1) preconditions gradients in rank space using K-FAC as a natural-gradient proxy; (2) periodically reprojects the low-rank basis onto dominant Fisher eigendirections to suppress drift; and (3) adapts the effective rank from the spectrum so capacity concentrates where signal resides. Across instruction-following, comprehension, and reasoning benchmarks on LLaMA backbones, GRIT matches or surpasses LoRA and QLoRA while reducing trainable parameters by 46% on average (25--80% across tasks), without practical quality loss across prompt styles and data mixes. To model forgetting, we fit a curvature-modulated power law. Empirically, GRIT yields lower drift and a better updates-vs-retention frontier than strong PEFT-optimizer baselines (Orthogonal-LoRA, IA3, DoRA, Eff-FT, Shampoo).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究监督学习中特征学习的本质特性，特别是探讨为什么监督学习会产生压缩性表示，以及如何从理论和随机视角统一理解对齐现象。

Method: 提出理论框架，推导核ODE来描述"水填充"谱演化，证明稳定稳态下核秩的上界，并分析SGD噪声的低秩特性。

Result: 证明监督学习的核秩受类别数限制，SGD噪声也是低秩的，动力学被限制在任务相关子空间内。

Conclusion: 监督学习本质上是压缩性的，产生低秩表示，而自监督学习则产生高秩扩展表示，这一框架统一了确定性和随机性视角下的对齐现象。

Abstract: We present a theory of feature learning in wide L2-regularized networks showing that supervised learning is inherently compressive. We derive a kernel ODE that predicts a "water-filling" spectral evolution and prove that for any stable steady state, the kernel rank is bounded by the number of classes ($C$). We further demonstrate that SGD noise is similarly low-rank ($O(C)$), confining dynamics to the task-relevant subspace. This framework unifies the deterministic and stochastic views of alignment and contrasts the low-rank nature of supervised learning with the high-rank, expansive representations of self-supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多智能体系统中，由于环境动态差异、隐私约束和通信带宽限制，直接共享数据学习统一的奖励函数通常不可行。需要一种能够处理异构智能体环境的联邦学习方法。

Method: 1) 每个客户端在本地执行轻量级的最大熵逆强化学习；2) 使用Wasserstein重心融合各个客户端的奖励函数；3) 考虑奖励函数的几何结构进行融合。

Result: 理论证明Wasserstein重心融合比传统的参数平均方法能够获得更准确的全局奖励函数估计，且该方法具有通信效率高的优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为异构智能体和环境提供了一个原则性且通信高效的框架，能够推导出具有良好泛化能力的共享奖励函数。

Abstract: In robotics and multi-agent systems, fleets of autonomous agents often operate in subtly different environments while pursuing a common high-level objective. Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有QAOA基准主要基于随机实例（如MaxCut、TSP、SAT），这些实例缺乏语义结构和人类可解释性，无法反映QAOA在具有现实约束问题上的真实性能。

Method: 引入QKRD基准，基于国际象棋战术位置构建5,000个结构化实例，具有单热约束、空间局部性和10-40量子比特规模，结合人类可解释的覆盖度指标和内在验证机制。

Result: 约束保持混合器（XY、域壁）比标准混合器收敛快约13步；预热策略减少45步收敛时间；CVaR优化效果不佳。QAOA性能优于贪心启发式算法12.6%，优于随机选择80.1%。

Conclusion: 结构化基准能揭示问题感知QAOA技术的优势，这些优势在随机实例中被掩盖。QKRD为可重复的NISQ算法研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is extensively benchmarked on synthetic random instances such as MaxCut, TSP, and SAT problems, but these lack semantic structure and human interpretability, offering limited insight into performance on real-world problems with meaningful constraints. We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\% and random selection by 80.1\%. Our results demonstrate that structured benchmarks reveal advantages of problem-informed QAOA techniques obscured in random instances. We release all code, data, and experimental artifacts for reproducible NISQ algorithm research.

Abstract: This paper presents a new detection method of faults at Nanosatellites' electrical power without an Attitude Determination Control Subsystem (ADCS) at the LEO orbit. Each part of this system is at risk of fault due to pressure tolerance, launcher pressure, and environmental circumstances. Common faults are line to line fault and open circuit for the photovoltaic subsystem, short circuit and open circuit IGBT at DC to DC converter, and regulator fault of the ground battery. The system is simulated without fault based on a neural network using solar radiation and solar panel's surface temperature as input data and current and load as outputs. Finally, using the neural network classifier, different faults are diagnosed by pattern and type of fault. For fault classification, other machine learning methods are also used, such as PCA classification, decision tree, and KNN.

Abstract: Human detection in videos plays an important role in various real-life applications. Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds. Learning in S-CNN takes 770 seconds with a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

Conclusion: DDL通过几何变换调制残差连接，扩展了残差网络的能力，为建模复杂状态转换提供了新范式。

Abstract: The efficacy of deep residual networks is fundamentally predicated on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $β(\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $β(\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning has enhanced the flow matching models on human preference alignment. While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step. Experimental results on different reward settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.

Conclusion: 该贝叶斯逆博弈方法能够实时处理有限传感器观测，为自主决策提供更安全的不确定性量化，是传统逆博弈方法的重要改进。

Abstract: Many multi-agent interaction scenarios can be naturally modeled as noncooperative games, where each agent's decisions depend on others' future actions. However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.

Motivation: 随着机器学习在医疗、金融等高风险领域的广泛应用，模型可解释性和责任性日益受到关注。然而，对表格数据固有可解释模型的系统性评估相对稀缺，现有研究多关注聚合性能结果。

Method: 研究比较了16种固有可解释方法，包括线性模型、决策树、可解释提升机(EBMs)、符号回归(SR)和广义最优稀疏决策树(GOSDT)等。评估基于216个真实表格数据集，按维度、样本量、线性度和类别不平衡等结构特征分层分析性能，并评估训练时间和分布偏移下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为寻求可解释性和预测性能平衡的实践者提供了实用指导，并深化了对表格数据可解释建模的实证理解，表明模型选择应基于具体数据集特征和应用场景。

Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across a broad range of sectors, including high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.
  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is essential for the reliable operation of complex systems, but most existing methods require extensive task-specific training. We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 提出了可控概念瓶颈模型（CCBMs），支持三种粒度的模型编辑：概念-标签级、概念级和数据级（包括数据删除和添加），无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念瓶颈模型主要关注静态场景，但实际应用中需要持续维护模型，如删除错误/敏感数据、纠正错误标注概念、适应新样本等，如何在大型应用中实现高效可编辑的CBMs是一大挑战。

Method: 基于影响函数推导出数学上严格的闭式近似方法，支持三种编辑粒度：概念-标签级编辑、概念级编辑、数据级编辑（包含数据删除和添加）。

Result: 实验结果表明CCBMs具有高效性和适应性，能够实现动态可信的概念瓶颈模型。

Conclusion: CCBMs为实际应用中的模型维护提供了有效的解决方案，支持动态环境下的模型编辑需求。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our CCBMs, affirming their practical value in enabling dynamic and trustworthy CBMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出TGE方法，通过轨迹级生成嵌入解决离线观察模仿学习中的专家数据稀缺和离线数据分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布匹配方法在专家演示稀缺且离线数据与专家行为差异大的情况下表现不佳，因为它们依赖严格的支持约束和脆弱的单步模型。

Method: TGE利用时间扩散模型在离线轨迹数据上学习潜在空间，通过估计专家状态密度构建密集平滑的替代奖励，捕捉长期时间动态并桥接分布差异。

Result: 在D4RL运动和控制基准测试中，TGE方法一致达到或优于现有的离线观察模仿学习方法。

Conclusion: TGE通过轨迹级生成嵌入有效解决了离线观察模仿学习中的数据分布差异问题，提供了鲁棒的学习信号。

Abstract: We consider the offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) where the expert demonstrations are scarce and the available offline suboptimal data are far from the expert behavior. Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了残差网络中层逐层SGD如何高效学习具有层次结构的标签模型，该类模型超越了先前可学习模型的深度限制，并提出了教师提供的细粒度标签揭示了大脑内部算法的层次结构，从而促进高效学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索深度学习中残差网络如何通过层逐层SGD学习具有层次结构的标签模型，该类模型突破了先前可学习模型的深度限制，并为理解深度学习提供了新的理论基础。

Method: 采用层逐层SGD（随机梯度下降）在残差网络上学习层次模型，该模型假设存在未知的标签层次结构，其中简单标签是输入的函数，而复杂标签是简单标签的函数。

Result: 证明了该类层次模型可以通过残差网络和层逐层SGD高效学习，且该类模型达到了高效可学习性的深度极限，即存在需要多项式深度才能表达的模型，而先前模型仅需对数深度电路。

Conclusion: 层次模型的可学习性可能为理解深度学习提供基础，教师提供的细粒度标签揭示了大脑内部算法的层次结构，从而促进了高效学习。

Abstract: We consider supervised learning with $n$ labels and show that layerwise SGD on residual networks can efficiently learn a class of hierarchical models. This model class assumes the existence of an (unknown) label hierarchy $L_1 \subseteq L_2 \subseteq \dots \subseteq L_r = [n]$, where labels in $L_1$ are simple functions of the input, while for $i > 1$, labels in $L_i$ are simple functions of simpler labels.
  Our class surpasses models that were previously shown to be learnable by deep learning algorithms, in the sense that it reaches the depth limit of efficient learnability. That is, there are models in this class that require polynomial depth to express, whereas previous models can be computed by log-depth circuits.
  Furthermore, we suggest that learnability of such hierarchical models might eventually form a basis for understanding deep learning. Beyond their natural fit for domains where deep learning excels, we argue that the mere existence of human ``teachers" supports the hypothesis that hierarchical structures are inherently available. By providing granular labels, teachers effectively reveal ``hints'' or ``snippets'' of the internal algorithms used by the brain. We formalize this intuition, showing that in a simplified model where a teacher is partially aware of their internal logic, a hierarchical structure emerges that facilitates efficient learnability.

*Hyunjun Kim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 正交性损失无法有效提升MoE模型的专家多样性，反而增加权重空间重叠，且对性能影响不一致，证明权重空间正则化不适合MoE多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究几何正则化在MoE模型专家专业化中的作用，特别是正交性损失对专家多样性的影响

Method: 在MoE模型中应用正交性损失来强制专家多样性，并在7种不同正则化强度下分析权重空间和激活空间的重叠情况

Result: 正交性损失导致权重空间重叠增加114%，激活空间重叠保持在0.6左右，性能影响不一致（WikiText-103略有改善，TinyStories轻微下降，PTB结果波动大），权重与激活正交性无显著相关性

Conclusion: 权重空间正则化既未实现其几何目标也未可靠提升性能，不适合用于MoE多样性

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficiency through sparse activation, but the role of geometric regularization in expert specialization remains unclear. We apply orthogonality loss to enforce expert diversity and find it fails on multiple fronts: it does not reduce weight-space overlap (MSO actually increases by up to 114%), activation-space overlap remains high (~0.6) regardless of regularization, and effects on performance are inconsistent -- marginal improvement on WikiText-103 (-0.9%), slight degradation on TinyStories (+0.9%), and highly variable results on PTB (std > 1.0). Our analysis across 7 regularization strengths reveals no significant correlation (r = -0.293, p = 0.523) between weight and activation orthogonality. These findings demonstrate that weight-space regularization neither achieves its geometric goal nor reliably improves performance, making it unsuitable for MoE diversity.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于1D UNet的数据增强方法AugUNet1D，用于自动标记脑电图中的棘波放电事件，相比传统方法和现有算法表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动标记脑电图中的事件（特别是棘波放电）耗时且效率低，尤其是在连续数周至数月的记录中。需要开发自动标记方法来减轻人工负担。

Method: 比较了14种机器学习分类器在961小时脑电图数据上的性能，发现1D UNet表现最佳。通过数据增强改进1D UNet，特别是缩放增强效果最好，得到AugUNet1D。

Result: AugUNet1D在检测棘波放电方面优于最近发布的时频算法"Twin Peaks"，检测到的事件特征与人工标记更相似。

Conclusion: AugUNet1D是一种有效的自动标记方法，已公开预训练和未训练模型供其他研究者使用。

Abstract: The manual labeling of events in electroencephalography (EEG) records is time-consuming. This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for others users.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多用户上下文赌博机框架，通过图拉普拉斯正则化与核方法的结合，构建统一的多用户再生核希尔伯特空间，设计了基于高斯过程后验的探索算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多用户上下文赌博机中用户奖励函数既具有非线性特性又存在图同质性（graph homophily）的问题，传统方法难以同时处理这两种特性。

Method: 提出联合惩罚项，结合图平滑项（基于RKHS距离）和个体粗糙度惩罚，推导出统一的多用户RKHS及其再生核，将问题重构为学习单个'提升'函数，设计LK-GP-UCB和LK-GP-TS算法。

Result: 理论证明遗憾界与多用户核的有效维度相关，而非用户数量或环境维度；实验表明在非线性设置中优于强基线方法，在线性奖励场景下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个统一、理论严谨且实用的框架，将拉普拉斯正则化与核化赌博机相结合，实现结构化探索。

Abstract: We study multi-user contextual bandits where users are related by a graph and their reward functions exhibit both non-linear behavior and graph homophily. We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\{f_u\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirically, our methods outperform strong linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive even when the true rewards are linear. Our work delivers a unified, theoretically grounded, and practical framework that bridges Laplacian regularization with kernelized bandits for structured exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索机器学习应用（特别是PINN）与传统数值方法在求解偏微分方程时的异同，分析PINN方法的优势和局限性。

Method: 通过比较标准数值离散化（有限差分法）和PINN学习两种方法，在一维动态问题（Burgers方程和Eikonal方程）上进行数值实验和对比分析。

Result: 发现两种方法都能获得基本相同的系统动力学知识，但PINN使用随机矩阵而非结构化矩阵，可接受的随机矩阵数量远多于有限差分的三对角矩阵形式。PINN参数更多，导致物理可解释性差且训练成本高。

Conclusion: 在一维动态问题中，PINN相比传统数值方法没有明显优势，但在高维问题中可能提供更好的策略。

Abstract: We inspect the analogy between machine-learning (ML) applications based on the transformer architecture without self-attention, {\it neural chains} hereafter, and discrete dynamical systems associated with discretised versions of neural integral and partial differential equations (NIE, PDE). A comparative analysis of the numerical solution of the (viscid and inviscid) Burgers and Eikonal equations via standard numerical discretization (also cast in terms of neural chains) and via PINN's learning is presented and commented on. It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure. However, our results refer to one-dimensional dynamic problems, hence they don't rule out the possibility that PINNs and ML in general, may offer better strategies for high-dimensional problems.

TL;DR: 该研究揭示了一个关键问题：小型语言模型（7-90亿参数）在作为自主代理部署时，50-69%的正确答案包含根本性推理错误，即"正确但理由错误"现象，而标准准确率指标无法检测到这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部署小型语言模型作为自主代理需要信任其推理过程，而不仅仅是输出结果。研究发现标准准确率指标存在严重缺陷，无法检测模型推理过程中的根本性错误。

Method: 通过分析10,734个推理轨迹，引入了推理完整性评分（RIS）作为过程性指标，并进行了机制分析，比较了检索增强生成（RAG）和元认知干预的效果。

Result: RAG显著提高了推理完整性（Cohen's d=0.23-0.93），而元认知干预往往损害性能（d=-0.14至-0.33）。RAG通过将计算基于外部证据，减少了7.6%的错误。

Conclusion: 研究强调了基于过程的验证对于可信代理的必要性：仅凭准确率是危险的，因为模型可能因完全错误的理由而得出正确答案。开发了一个神经分类器，实现了0.86的F1分数和100倍加速。

Abstract: Deploying small language models (7-9B parameters) as autonomous agents requires trust in their reasoning, not just their outputs. We reveal a critical reliability crisis: 50-69\% of correct answers from these models contain fundamentally flawed reasoning -- a ``Right-for-Wrong-Reasons'' phenomenon invisible to standard accuracy metrics. Through analysis of 10,734 reasoning traces across three models and diverse tasks, we introduce the Reasoning Integrity Score (RIS), a process-based metric validated with substantial inter-rater agreement ($κ=0.657$). Conventional practices are challenged by our findings: while retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) significantly improves reasoning integrity (Cohen's $d=0.23$--$0.93$), meta-cognitive interventions like self-critique often harm performance ($d=-0.14$ to $-0.33$) in small models on the evaluated tasks. Mechanistic analysis reveals RAG succeeds by grounding calculations in external evidence, reducing errors by 7.6\%, while meta-cognition amplifies confusion without sufficient model capacity. To enable deployment, verification capabilities are distilled into a neural classifier achieving 0.86 F1-score with 100$\times$ speedup. These results underscore the necessity of process-based verification for trustworthy agents: accuracy alone is dangerously insufficient when models can be right for entirely wrong reasons.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有异常检测方法不适用于LLM智能体多步骤计划：均值池化嵌入会稀释异常步骤，而仅对比方法忽略序列结构，标准无监督方法F1分数最高仅0.69。

Method: 使用Siamese循环自编码器结合对比学习和重构的混合损失函数，同时检测"任务计划错误"和"计划结构异常"两类问题。

Result: 在合成扰动和真实世界故障基准测试中，F1分数达到0.88-0.94（平衡集），召回率0.86-0.92（不平衡外部基准），推理延迟仅32毫秒，比LLM Judge基线快17-27倍。

Conclusion: Trajectory Guard能够有效统一检测多步骤计划的上下文对齐和结构一致性异常，满足生产部署的实时安全验证需求。

Abstract: Autonomous LLM agents generate multi-step action plans that can fail due to contextual misalignment or structural incoherence. Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.

Motivation: 帕金森病具有异质性表现，需要整合生物和临床标记物。现有计算模型在可解释性、类别不平衡和多模态数据融合方面存在局限。

Method: 使用模态特定编码器和对称交叉注意力机制整合MRI皮层厚度、MRI体积测量、临床评估和人口统计学变量，采用稀疏约束注意力门控融合层和类别平衡焦点损失函数。

Result: 在703名参与者（570名PD患者，133名健康对照）的五折交叉验证中，SAFN达到0.98±0.02的准确率和1.00±0.00的PR-AUC，优于现有基准方法。

Conclusion: SAFN为神经退行性疾病的计算分析提供了可重现和透明的多模态建模范式，决策过程与临床诊断原则一致。

Abstract: Characterising the heterogeneous presentation of Parkinson's disease (PD) requires integrating biological and clinical markers within a unified predictive framework. While multimodal data provide complementary information, many existing computational models struggle with interpretability, class imbalance, or effective fusion of high-dimensional imaging and tabular clinical features. To address these limitations, we propose the Class-Weighted Sparse-Attention Fusion Network (SAFN), an interpretable deep learning framework for robust multimodal profiling. SAFN integrates MRI cortical thickness, MRI volumetric measures, clinical assessments, and demographic variables using modality-specific encoders and a symmetric cross-attention mechanism that captures nonlinear interactions between imaging and clinical representations. A sparsity-constrained attention-gating fusion layer dynamically prioritises informative modalities, while a class-balanced focal loss (beta = 0.999, gamma = 1.5) mitigates dataset imbalance without synthetic oversampling. Evaluated on 703 participants (570 PD, 133 healthy controls) from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative using subject-wise five-fold cross-validation, SAFN achieves an accuracy of 0.98 plus or minus 0.02 and a PR-AUC of 1.00 plus or minus 0.00, outperforming established machine learning and deep learning baselines. Interpretability analysis shows a clinically coherent decision process, with approximately 60 percent of predictive weight assigned to clinical assessments, consistent with Movement Disorder Society diagnostic principles. SAFN provides a reproducible and transparent multimodal modelling paradigm for computational profiling of neurodegenerative disease.

Result: 64单元LSTM模型在保持精度的同时，MAPE从128单元的23.6%降至12.4%，模型大小从280KB压缩至76KB（减少73%），准确率提升47%。

Conclusion: 实验证明较大的模型并不总能获得更好的结果，适当的模型压缩可以同时实现模型精简和性能提升。

Abstract: Standard LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks provide accurate predictions for sales data in the retail industry, but require a lot of computing power. It can be challenging especially for mid to small retail industries. This paper examines LSTM model compression by gradually reducing the number of hidden units from 128 to 16. We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate. These results show that larger models do not always achieve better results.

Abstract: In this article, we explore federated customization of large models and highlight the key challenges it poses within the federated learning framework. We review several popular large model customization techniques, including full fine-tuning, efficient fine-tuning, prompt engineering, prefix-tuning, knowledge distillation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Then, we discuss how these techniques can be implemented within the federated learning framework. Moreover, we conduct experiments on federated prefix-tuning, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first trial to apply prefix-tuning in the federated learning setting. The conducted experiments validate its feasibility with performance close to centralized approaches. Further comparison with three other federated customization methods demonstrated its competitive performance, satisfactory efficiency, and consistent robustness.

Abstract: Planogram creation is a significant challenge for retail, requiring an average of 30 hours per complex layout. This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests. This work demonstrates the viability of generative AI for automated retail space optimization.

Conclusion: 基于熵的重训练框架提供了一种原理性的数据漂移管理方法，能够在不牺牲性能的情况下显著降低重训练成本，为实际部署中的模型维护提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.

TL;DR: 本文挑战了现有对抗性攻击理论，提出应区分利用非鲁棒特征的攻击和不利用此类特征的攻击，并提出了基于集成学习的度量方法来量化非鲁棒特征操纵程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要关注利用非鲁棒特征的对抗样本，但忽略了不直接利用这些特征的攻击样本。作者认为这两种样本代表了不同类型的对抗性弱点，需要区分评估。

Method: 提出基于集成学习的度量方法，用于测量对抗性扰动对非鲁棒特征的操纵程度，并用此方法分析攻击者生成的对抗样本构成。

Result: 通过新度量方法重新审视了多个现象，包括锐度感知最小化对对抗鲁棒性的影响，以及在鲁棒数据集上对抗训练与标准训练之间的鲁棒性差距。

Conclusion: 区分两种对抗样本类型能为对抗鲁棒性评估提供新视角，有助于更全面地理解深度神经网络的脆弱性机制。

Abstract: Over the past decade, numerous theories have been proposed to explain the widespread vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial evasion attacks. Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前训练方法缺乏确保模型在不同运行中保持一致和鲁棒性能的机制，即使控制初始化条件和训练环境，模型准确率仍存在显著变异性。

Method: 设计了一种可参数调优的自定义损失函数（CLF），通过显式平衡预测准确性和训练稳定性来降低对权重初始化和数据洗牌等随机因素的敏感性。

Result: 在多种图像分类和时间序列预测架构上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提高了训练鲁棒性，同时不牺牲预测性能。

Conclusion: CLF被证明是开发更稳定、可靠和可信赖神经网络的有效高效策略。

Abstract: To enhance the reproducibility and reliability of deep learning models, we address a critical gap in current training methodologies: the lack of mechanisms that ensure consistent and robust performance across runs. Our empirical analysis reveals that even under controlled initialization and training conditions, the accuracy of the model can exhibit significant variability. To address this issue, we propose a Custom Loss Function (CLF) that reduces the sensitivity of training outcomes to stochastic factors such as weight initialization and data shuffling. By fine-tuning its parameters, CLF explicitly balances predictive accuracy with training stability, leading to more consistent and reliable model performance. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures for both image classification and time series forecasting demonstrate that our approach significantly improves training robustness without sacrificing predictive performance. These results establish CLF as an effective and efficient strategy for developing more stable, reliable and trustworthy neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MoE模型虽然能通过稀疏激活专家减少计算负担，但在联邦学习环境中面临三个关键挑战：专家选择缺乏可靠指标、异构设备资源限制、客户端特定专家子集导致全局聚合困难。

Method: HFedMoE基于专家对微调性能的贡献度识别重要性，从信息瓶颈角度自适应选择专家子集匹配客户端计算预算，并设计稀疏感知模型聚合策略。

Result: 大量实验表明，HFedMoE在训练准确率和收敛速度上优于现有最优基准方法。

Conclusion: HFedMoE成功解决了MoE模型在联邦学习环境中的关键挑战，为资源受限设备上的LLM微调提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) enables fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) without compromising data privacy, the substantial size of an LLM renders on-device training impractical for resource-constrained clients, such as mobile devices. Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种机器学习方法，利用路线拓扑特征和运动员当前体能状态来预测骑行时间，避免了传统物理模型需要复杂参数的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有骑行时间预测方案依赖需要大量参数（如空气阻力系数、实时风速）的物理模型，这对业余骑行者来说不实用。

Method: 使用机器学习方法，结合路线拓扑特征和运动员当前体能状态（通过训练负荷指标得出），采用Lasso回归模型，在单运动员数据集（N=96次骑行）上进行N-of-1研究设计。

Result: Lasso回归结合拓扑+体能特征取得了MAE=6.60分钟和R2=0.922的预测效果，整合体能指标比仅使用拓扑特征将误差降低了14%。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了生理状态对自我调节骑行表现有显著约束作用，渐进式检查点预测支持动态比赛规划。

Abstract: Predicting cycling duration for a given route is essential for training planning and event preparation. Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts. Progressive checkpoint predictions enable dynamic race planning as route difficulty becomes apparent.

Abstract: In the context of smart city transportation, efficient matching of taxi supply with passenger demand requires real-time integration of urban traffic network data and mobility patterns. Conventional taxi hotspot prediction models often rely solely on historical demand, overlooking dynamic influences such as traffic congestion, road incidents, and public events. This paper presents a traffic-aware, graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework for optimal taxi placement in metropolitan environments. The urban road network is modeled as a graph where intersections represent nodes, road segments serve as edges, and node attributes capture historical demand, event proximity, and real-time congestion scores obtained from live traffic APIs. Graph Neural Network (GNN) embeddings are employed to encode spatial-temporal dependencies within the traffic network, which are then used by a Q-learning agent to recommend optimal taxi hotspots. The reward mechanism jointly optimizes passenger waiting time, driver travel distance, and congestion avoidance. Experiments on a simulated Delhi taxi dataset, generated using real geospatial boundaries and historic ride-hailing request patterns, demonstrate that the proposed model reduced passenger waiting time by about 56% and reduced travel distance by 38% compared to baseline stochastic selection. The proposed approach is adaptable to multi-modal transport systems and can be integrated into smart city platforms for real-time urban mobility optimization.

Motivation: 解决机器学习中次模目标在约束下的最大化问题，特别是针对非单调且弱DR-次模函数的优化挑战

Method: 结合Frank-Wolfe引导的连续贪婪框架和γ感知的双贪婪步骤，处理非单调性问题

Result: 算法在γ=1时恢复0.401近似比，对于γ<1的情况性能优雅下降，且优于现有同类问题的边界

Conclusion: 该方法为处理非单调γ-弱DR-次模函数最大化问题提供了简单有效的解决方案，达到了该领域的最先进性能

Abstract: Maximizing submodular objectives under constraints is a fundamental problem in machine learning and optimization. We study the maximization of a nonnegative, non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular function over a down-closed convex body. Our main result is an approximation algorithm whose guarantee depends smoothly on $γ$; in particular, when $γ=1$ (the DR-submodular case) our bound recovers the $0.401$ approximation factor, while for $γ<1$ the guarantee degrades gracefully and, it improves upon previously reported bounds for $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization under the same constraints. Our approach combines a Frank-Wolfe-guided continuous-greedy framework with a $γ$-aware double-greedy step, yielding a simple yet effective procedure for handling non-monotonicity. This results in state-of-the-art guarantees for non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization over down-closed convex bodies.

Method: 构建YapBench基准测试，包含300多个英语提示，涵盖三种简洁性理想场景，每个项目包括单轮提示、精心策划的最小充分基准答案和类别标签，使用YapScore和YapIndex指标评估模型表现。

Result: 评估76个助手LLMs发现中位数超额长度存在数量级差异，观察到类别特定的失败模式，包括在模糊输入上的真空填充和在单行技术请求上的解释或格式化开销。

Conclusion: YapBench基准测试能够有效量化LLMs的过度生成问题，揭示了不同模型在简洁性响应上的显著差异，并发布了基准测试和实时排行榜用于跟踪模型行为变化。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini increasingly act as general-purpose copilots, yet they often respond with unnecessary length on simple requests, adding redundant explanations, hedging, or boilerplate that increases cognitive load and inflates token-based inference cost. Prior work suggests that preference-based post-training and LLM-judged evaluations can induce systematic length bias, where longer answers are rewarded even at comparable quality.
  We introduce YapBench, a lightweight benchmark for quantifying user-visible over-generation on brevity-ideal prompts. Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.
  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests. We release the benchmark and maintain a live leaderboard for tracking verbosity behavior over time.

Abstract: This paper introduces Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization (IGBO), a framework that trains interpretable models by incorporating structured domain knowledge via a bi-objective formulation. IGBO encodes feature importance hierarchies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and uses Temporal Integrated Gradients (TIG) to measure feature importance. To address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in TIG computation, we propose an Optimal Path Oracle that learns data-manifold-aware integration paths. Theoretical analysis proves convergence properties and robustness to mini-batch noise, while empirical results on time-series data demonstrate IGBO's effectiveness in enforcing DAG constraints with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming standard regularization baselines.

Conclusion: Avatar Forcing框架成功实现了实时、表达力强的交互式头像生成，为虚拟通信和内容创作提供了更自然的交互体验。

Abstract: Talking head generation creates lifelike avatars from static portraits for virtual communication and content creation. However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.

Conclusion: IRPO有效解决了GRMs在RL应用中的计算效率问题，同时保持了优异的性能表现，为生成奖励模型的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) have attracted considerable research interest in reward modeling due to their interpretability, inference-time scalability, and potential for refinement through reinforcement learning (RL). However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.

Conclusion: TeleDoCTR系统有效提升了电信票务故障排除的效能和效率，为复杂服务组织中的自动化故障排除提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Ticket troubleshooting refers to the process of analyzing and resolving problems that are reported through a ticketing system. In large organizations offering a wide range of services, this task is highly complex due to the diversity of submitted tickets and the need for specialized domain knowledge. In particular, troubleshooting in telecommunications (telecom) is a very time-consuming task as it requires experts to interpret ticket content, consult documentation, and search historical records to identify appropriate resolutions. This human-intensive approach not only delays issue resolution but also hinders overall operational efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ticket troubleshooting in telecom, we propose TeleDoCTR, a novel telecom-related, domain-specific, and contextual troubleshooting system tailored for end-to-end ticket resolution in telecom. TeleDoCTR integrates both domain-specific ranking and generative models to automate key steps of the troubleshooting workflow which are: routing tickets to the appropriate expert team responsible for resolving the ticket (classification task), retrieving contextually and semantically similar historical tickets (retrieval task), and generating a detailed fault analysis report outlining the issue, root cause, and potential solutions (generation task). We evaluate TeleDoCTR on a real-world dataset from a telecom infrastructure and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the troubleshooting process.

Conclusion: ARISE提供了一种简单、架构无关的方法来增强RL智能体的探索能力和鲁棒性，无需改变核心算法结构

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.

Conclusion: BSAT特别适用于内存受限的场景，为长序列时间序列预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting using transformers is hampered by the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the rigidity of uniform patching, which may be misaligned with the data's semantic structure. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{B-Spline Adaptive Tokenizer (BSAT)}, a novel, parameter-free method that adaptively segments a time series by fitting it with B-splines. BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position. Further, we propose a hybrid positional encoding that combines a additive learnable positional encoding with Rotary Positional Embedding featuring a layer-wise learnable base: L-RoPE. This allows each layer to attend to different temporal dependencies. Our experiments on several public benchmarks show that our model is competitive with strong performance at high compression rates. This makes it particularly well-suited for use cases with strong memory constraints.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive precision tuning of linear solvers, and can be extended to general algorithms. The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.

Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning train a critic with temporal-difference updates and use it as a learning signal for the policy (actor). This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.

### [126] [The Reasoning-Creativity Trade-off: Toward Creativity-Driven Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00747)
*Max Ruiz Luyten,Mihaela van der Schaar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了当前LLM推理流程中基于正确性的优化会导致推理路径分布崩溃，削弱创造性问题解决能力，提出了分布创造性推理（DCR）框架来同时保持正确性和创造性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推理流程主要优化正确性，导致模型推理路径分布崩溃，语义熵降低，从而削弱创造性问题解决能力。需要一种能同时保持正确性和创造性的方法。

Method: 提出分布创造性推理（DCR）框架，将训练建模为通过概率测度的梯度流，统一了STaR、GRPO、DPO等多种方法，并提供了防止分布崩溃的稳定设计。

Result: DCR框架揭示了正确性目标导致多样性衰减的定理，提出了防止崩溃的收敛设计，并给出了实际可行的实现方案。

Conclusion: DCR为LLM提供了首个既能保持正确性又能保持创造性的理论框架和实用方法。

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language model (LLM) pipelines rely on bootstrapped reasoning loops: sampling diverse chains of thought and reinforcing the highest-scoring ones, mainly optimizing correctness. We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.

*Sean Groom,Shuo Wang,Francisco Belo,Axl Rice,Liam Anderson*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于协变量依赖隐马尔可夫模型（CDHMM）的方法，用于评估足球角球防守中的无球防守表现，通过球员追踪数据自动识别盯人和区域防守任务，并建立新的防守贡献评估框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统足球防守评估指标难以捕捉无球防守的协调性运动，现有反事实分析方法往往基于缺乏战术背景的"平均"行为模拟，无法准确评估角球等结构化场景的防守表现。

Method: 开发了针对角球的协变量依赖隐马尔可夫模型（CDHMM），无需人工标注即可从球员追踪数据中推断时间相关的盯人和区域防守任务分配，并提出了基于角色条件的幽灵模型进行反事实分析。

Result: 该方法能够自动识别防守任务分配，提供可解释的防守贡献评估，相比传统方法更能反映战术背景下的真实防守表现。

Conclusion: 提出的CDHMM框架为足球角球防守提供了新的分析工具，能够更准确地评估无球防守表现，为战术分析和球员评估提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Evaluating off-ball defensive performance in football is challenging, as traditional metrics do not capture the nuanced coordinated movements that limit opponent action selection and success probabilities. Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating "average" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.

Conclusion: MBC通过有效的记忆压缩和稳定学习机制，为大规模数据流下的LLM持续学习提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

Result: 实验表明该方法在各种基准测试中取得了竞争性或改进的优化性能。

Conclusion: 扩散基重参数化技术为分类变量优化提供了有效的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization with categorical variables typically relies on score-function estimators, which are unbiased but noisy, or on continuous relaxations that replace the discrete distribution with a smooth surrogate admitting a pathwise (reparameterized) gradient, at the cost of optimizing a biased, temperature-dependent objective. In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 现有嵌入级生成器在非IID客户端异构性下表现不佳，且对梯度泄漏的正式保护有限。FedHypeVAE旨在解决这些问题，实现隐私保护的联邦数据合成。

Conclusion: FedHypeVAE提供了一个有效的联邦数据共享解决方案，能够在保护隐私的同时处理非IID数据分布，支持领域无关的合成和多域覆盖。

Abstract: Federated data sharing promises utility without centralizing raw data, yet existing embedding-level generators struggle under non-IID client heterogeneity and provide limited formal protection against gradient leakage. We propose FedHypeVAE, a differentially private, hypernetwork-driven framework for synthesizing embedding-level data across decentralized clients. Building on a conditional VAE backbone, we replace the single global decoder and fixed latent prior with client-aware decoders and class-conditional priors generated by a shared hypernetwork from private, trainable client codes. This bi-level design personalizes the generative layerrather than the downstream modelwhile decoupling local data from communicated parameters. The shared hypernetwork is optimized under differential privacy, ensuring that only noise-perturbed, clipped gradients are aggregated across clients. A local MMD alignment between real and synthetic embeddings and a Lipschitz regularizer on hypernetwork outputs further enhance stability and distributional coherence under non-IID conditions. After training, a neutral meta-code enables domain agnostic synthesis, while mixtures of meta-codes provide controllable multi-domain coverage. FedHypeVAE unifies personalization, privacy, and distribution alignment at the generator level, establishing a principled foundation for privacy-preserving data synthesis in federated settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练的方法，通过注意力模式的光谱分析来检测大语言模型中的有效数学推理，将注意力矩阵视为动态图的邻接矩阵，提取四个可解释的光谱诊断指标，在多个模型上实现85-95%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在数学推理中存在幻觉问题，需要一种无需训练数据或微调的方法来验证推理的有效性，特别是检测逻辑一致性而非仅仅是形式验证器的接受。

Method: 将注意力矩阵作为动态图的邻接矩阵，提取Fiedler值（代数连通性）、高频能量比（HFER）、图信号平滑度和光谱熵四个光谱诊断指标，通过单一阈值实现分类。

Result: 在七个不同架构的transformer模型上实验，效果量达到Cohen's d=3.30，分类准确率85.0-95.6%，校准阈值在完整数据集上达到93-95%准确率。发现Mistral-7B的滑动窗口注意力机制改变了判别信号的特征分布。

Conclusion: 光谱图分析为推理验证提供了一个原则性框架，在幻觉检测和AI安全监控方面具有直接应用价值，揭示了注意力机制设计如何影响推理有效性的光谱特征捕获。

Abstract: We present a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in large language models through spectral analysis of attention patterns. By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\text{MW}} = 1.16 \times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.

Conclusion: 该框架在时间关键和不确定环境中具有可靠的机器人规划潜力，能够处理随机转移、扩展到大状态空间并适应部分可观测性。

Abstract: Robotic systems operating in dynamic and uncertain environments increasingly require planners that satisfy complex task sequences while adhering to strict temporal constraints. Metric Interval Temporal Logic (MITL) offers a formal and expressive framework for specifying such time-bounded requirements; however, integrating MITL with reinforcement learning (RL) remains challenging due to stochastic dynamics and partial observability. This paper presents a unified automata-based RL framework for synthesizing policies in both Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) under MITL specifications. MITL formulas are translated into Timed Limit-Deterministic Generalized Büchi Automata (Timed-LDGBA) and synchronized with the underlying decision process to construct product timed models suitable for Q-learning. A simple yet expressive reward structure enforces temporal correctness while allowing additional performance objectives. The approach is validated in three simulation studies: a $5 \times 5$ grid-world formulated as an MDP, a $10 \times 10$ grid-world formulated as a POMDP, and an office-like service-robot scenario. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently learns policies that satisfy strict time-bounded requirements under stochastic transitions, scales to larger state spaces, and remains effective in partially observable environments, highlighting its potential for reliable robotic planning in time-critical and uncertain settings.

Abstract: Generative models have emerged as powerful tools for planning, with compositional approaches offering particular promise for modeling long-horizon task distributions by composing together local, modular generative models. This compositional paradigm spans diverse domains, from multi-step manipulation planning to panoramic image synthesis to long video generation. However, compositional generative models face a critical challenge: when local distributions are multimodal, existing composition methods average incompatible modes, producing plans that are neither locally feasible nor globally coherent. We propose Compositional Diffusion with Guided Search (CDGS), which addresses this \emph{mode averaging} problem by embedding search directly within the diffusion denoising process. Our method explores diverse combinations of local modes through population-based sampling, prunes infeasible candidates using likelihood-based filtering, and enforces global consistency through iterative resampling between overlapping segments. CDGS matches oracle performance on seven robot manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines that lack compositionality or require long-horizon training data. The approach generalizes across domains, enabling coherent text-guided panoramic images and long videos through effective local-to-global message passing. More details: https://cdgsearch.github.io/

Abstract: Robotic fleets such as unmanned aerial and ground vehicles have been widely used for routine inspections of static environments, where the areas of interest are known and planned in advance. However, in many applications, such areas of interest are unknown and should be identified online during exploration. Thus, this paper considers the problem of simultaneous exploration, inspection of unknown environments and then real-time communication to a mobile ground control station to report the findings. The heterogeneous robots are equipped with different sensors, e.g., long-range lidars for fast exploration and close-range cameras for detailed inspection. Furthermore, global communication is often unavailable in such environments, where the robots can only communicate with each other via ad-hoc wireless networks when they are in close proximity and free of obstruction. This work proposes a novel planning and coordination framework (SLEI3D) that integrates the online strategies for collaborative 3D exploration, adaptive inspection and timely communication (via the intermit-tent or proactive protocols). To account for uncertainties w.r.t. the number and location of features, a multi-layer and multi-rate planning mechanism is developed for inter-and-intra robot subgroups, to actively meet and coordinate their local plans. The proposed framework is validated extensively via high-fidelity simulations of numerous large-scale missions with up to 48 robots and 384 thousand cubic meters. Hardware experiments of 7 robots are also conducted. Project website is available at https://junfengchen-robotics.github.io/SLEI3D/.

Abstract: Perching allows unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to reduce energy consumption, remain anchored for surface sampling operations, or stably survey their surroundings. Previous efforts for perching on vertical surfaces have predominantly focused on lightweight mechanical design solutions with relatively scant system-level integration. Furthermore, perching strategies for vertical surfaces commonly require high-speed, aggressive landing operations that are dangerous for a surveyor drone with sensitive electronics onboard. This work presents the preliminary investigation of a perching approach suitable for larger drones that both gently perches on vertical tree trunks and reacts and recovers from perch failures. The system in this work, called SLAP, consists of vision-based perch site detector, an IMU (inertial-measurement-unit)-based perch failure detector, an attitude controller for soft perching, an optical close-range detection system, and a fast active elastic gripper with microspines made from commercially-available slapbands. We validated this approach on a modified 1.2 kg commercial quadrotor with component and system analysis. Initial human-in-the-loop autonomous indoor flight experiments achieved a 75% perch success rate on a real oak tree segment across 20 flights, and 100% perch failure recovery across 2 flights with induced failures.

Abstract: In vehicle production factories, the vehicle painting process employs multiple robotic arms to simultaneously apply paint to car bodies advancing along a conveyor line. Designing paint paths for these robotic arms, which involves assigning car body areas to arms and determining paint sequences for each arm, remains a time-consuming manual task for engineers, indicating the demand for automation and design time reduction. The unique constraints of the painting process hinder the direct application of conventional robotic path planning techniques, such as those used in welding. Therefore, this paper formulates the design of paint paths as a hierarchical optimization problem, where the upper-layer subproblem resembles a vehicle routing problem (VRP), and the lower-layer subproblem involves detailed path planning. This approach allows the use of different optimization algorithms at each layer, and permits flexible handling of constraints specific to the vehicle painting process through the design of variable representation, constraints, repair operators, and an initialization process at the upper and lower layers. Experiments with three commercially available vehicle models demonstrated that the proposed method can automatically design paths that satisfy all constraints for vehicle painting with quality comparable to those created manually by engineers.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and wheeled robots are widely used in many applications in both indoor and outdoor settings. In practical situations with limited GNSS signals or degraded lighting conditions, the navigation solution may rely only on inertial sensors and as result drift in time due to errors in the inertial measurement. In this work, we propose WiCHINS, a wheeled and chassis inertial navigation system by combining wheel-mounted-inertial sensors with a chassis-mounted inertial sensor for accurate pure inertial navigation. To that end, we derive a three-stage framework, each with a dedicated extended Kalman filter. This framework utilizes the benefits of each location (wheel/body) during the estimation process. To evaluate our proposed approach, we employed a dataset with five inertial measurement units with a total recording time of 228.6 minutes. We compare our approach with four other inertial baselines and demonstrate an average position error of 11.4m, which is $2.4\%$ of the average traveled distance, using two wheels and one body inertial measurement units. As a consequence, our proposed method enables robust navigation in challenging environments and helps bridge the pure-inertial performance gap.

Abstract: The food packaging industry goes through changes in food items and their weights quite rapidly. These items range from easy-to-pick, single-piece food items to flexible, long and cluttered ones. We propose a replaceable bit-based gripper system to tackle the challenge of weight-based handling of cluttered food items. The gripper features specialized food attachments(bits) that enhance its grasping capabilities, and a belt replacement system allows switching between different food items during packaging operations. It offers a wide range of control options, enabling it to grasp and drop specific weights of granular, cluttered, and entangled foods. We specifically designed bits for two flexible food items that differ in shape: ikura(salmon roe) and spaghetti. They represent the challenging categories of sticky, granular food and long, sticky, cluttered food, respectively. The gripper successfully picked up both spaghetti and ikura and demonstrated weight-specific dropping of these items with an accuracy over 80% and 95% respectively. The gripper system also exhibited quick switching between different bits, leading to the handling of a large range of food items.

Abstract: Space debris is an ever-increasing problem in space travel. There are already many old, no longer functional spacecraft and debris orbiting the earth, which endanger both the safe operation of satellites and space travel. Small nano-satellite swarms can address this problem by autonomously de-orbiting debris safely into the Earth's atmosphere. This work builds on the recent advances of autonomous agents deployed in resource-constrained platforms and shows a first simplified approach how such intelligent and autonomous nano-satellite swarms can be realized. We implement our autonomous agent software on wireless microcontrollers and perform experiments on a specialized test-bed to show the feasibility and overall energy efficiency of our approach.

Abstract: Many hybrid problems in robotics involve both continuous and discrete components, and modeling them together for estimation tasks has been a long standing and difficult problem. Hybrid Factor Graphs give us a mathematical framework to model these types of problems, however existing approaches for solving them are based on approximations. In this work, we propose an efficient Hybrid Factor Graph framework alongwith a variable elimination algorithm to produce a hybrid Bayes network, which can then be used for exact Maximum A Posteriori estimation and marginalization over both sets of variables. Our approach first develops a novel hybrid Gaussian factor which can connect to both discrete and continuous variables, and a hybrid conditional which can represent multiple continuous hypotheses conditioned on the discrete variables. Using these representations, we derive the process of hybrid variable elimination under the Conditional Linear Gaussian scheme, giving us exact posteriors as hybrid Bayes network. To bound the number of discrete hypotheses, we use a tree-structured representation of the factors coupled with a simple pruning and probabilistic assignment scheme, which allows for tractable inference. We demonstrate the applicability of our framework on a SLAM dataset with ambiguous measurements, where discrete choices for the most likely measurement have to be made. Our demonstrated results showcase the accuracy, generality, and simplicity of our hybrid factor graph framework.

Abstract: This paper presents an end-to-end LLM-based agentic exploration system for an indoor shopping task, evaluated in both Gazebo simulation and a corresponding real-world corridor layout. The robot incrementally builds a lightweight semantic map by detecting signboards at junctions and storing direction-to-POI relations together with estimated junction poses, while AprilTags provide repeatable anchors for approach and alignment. Given a natural-language shopping request, an LLM produces a constrained discrete action at each junction (direction and whether to enter a store), and a ROS finite-state main controller executes the decision by gating modular motion primitives, including local-costmap-based obstacle avoidance, AprilTag approaching, store entry, and grasping. Qualitative results show that the integrated stack can perform end-to-end task execution from user instruction to multi-store navigation and object retrieval, while remaining modular and debuggable through its text-based map and logged decision history.

Motivation: 传统多机器人覆盖路径规划方法假设区域均匀重要，但在实际应用中某些区域需要优先覆盖，现有方法无法有效处理这种优先级需求。

Method: 提出可扩展的两阶段框架：1）贪心区域分配结合局部搜索和生成树路径规划；2）斯坦纳树引导的残余覆盖。

Conclusion: PA-MCPP方法能够有效处理优先级区域覆盖需求，具有良好的可扩展性和控制灵活性。

Abstract: Multi-robot systems are widely used for coverage tasks that require efficient coordination across large environments. In Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP), the objective is typically to minimize the makespan by generating non-overlapping paths for full-area coverage. However, most existing methods assume uniform importance across regions, limiting their effectiveness in scenarios where some zones require faster attention. We introduce the Priority-Aware MCPP (PA-MCPP) problem, where a subset of the environment is designated as prioritized zones with associated weights. The goal is to minimize, in lexicographic order, the total priority-weighted latency of zone coverage and the overall makespan. To address this, we propose a scalable two-phase framework combining (1) greedy zone assignment with local search, spanning-tree-based path planning, and (2) Steiner-tree-guided residual coverage. Experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that our method significantly reduces priority-weighted latency compared to standard MCPP baselines, while maintaining competitive makespan. Sensitivity analyses further show that the method scales well with the number of robots and that zone coverage behavior can be effectively controlled by adjusting priority weights.

Abstract: A large-scale mobile robot (LSMR) is a high-order multibody system that often operates on loose, unconsolidated terrain, which reduces traction. This paper presents a comprehensive navigation and control framework for an LSMR that ensures stability and safety-defined performance, delivering robust operation on slip-prone terrain by jointly leveraging high-performance techniques. The proposed architecture comprises four main modules: (1) a visual pose-estimation module that fuses onboard sensors and stereo cameras to provide an accurate, low-latency robot pose, (2) a high-level nonlinear model predictive control that updates the wheel motion commands to correct robot drift from the robot reference pose on slip-prone terrain, (3) a low-level deep neural network control policy that approximates the complex behavior of the wheel-driven actuation mechanism in LSMRs, augmented with robust adaptive control to handle out-of-distribution disturbances, ensuring that the wheels accurately track the updated commands issued by high-level control module, and (4) a logarithmic safety module to monitor the entire robot stack and guarantees safe operation. The proposed low-level control framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation subsystem, while the safety module ensures the whole system-level safety during operation. Comparative experiments on a 6,000 kg LSMR actuated by two complex electro-hydrostatic drives, while synchronizing modules operating at different frequencies.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) is effective in many robotic applications, but it requires extensive exploration of the state-action space, during which behaviors can be unsafe. This significantly limits its applicability to large robots with complex actuators operating on unstable terrain. Hence, to design a safe goal-reaching control framework for large-scale robots, this paper decomposes the whole system into a set of tightly coupled functional modules. 1) A real-time visual pose estimation approach is employed to provide accurate robot states to 2) an RL motion planner for goal-reaching tasks that explicitly respects robot specifications. The RL module generates real-time smooth motion commands for the actuator system, independent of its underlying dynamic complexity. 3) In the actuation mechanism, a supervised deep learning model is trained to capture the complex dynamics of the robot and provide this model to 4) a model-based robust adaptive controller that guarantees the wheels track the RL motion commands even on slip-prone terrain. 5) Finally, to reduce human intervention, a mathematical safety supervisor monitors the robot, stops it on unsafe faults, and autonomously guides it back to a safe inspection area. The proposed framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation system and safety of the whole operation. Experiments on a 6,000 kg robot in different scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Abstract: A well-designed reward is critical for effective reinforcement learning-based policy improvement. In real-world robotic domains, obtaining such rewards typically requires either labor-intensive human labeling or brittle, handcrafted objectives. Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise as automatic reward models, yet their effectiveness on real robot tasks is poorly understood. In this work, we aim to close this gap by introducing (1) \textbf{RoboReward}, a robotics reward dataset and benchmark built on large-scale real-robot corpora from Open X-Embodiment (OXE) and RoboArena, and (2) vision-language reward models trained on this dataset (RoboReward 4B/8B). Because OXE is success-heavy and lacks failure examples, we propose a \emph{negative examples data augmentation} pipeline that generates calibrated \emph{negatives} and \emph{near-misses} via counterfactual relabeling of successful episodes and temporal clipping to create partial-progress outcomes from the same videos. Using this framework, we produce an extensive training and evaluation dataset that spans diverse tasks and embodiments and enables systematic evaluation of whether state-of-the-art VLMs can reliably provide rewards for robotics. Our evaluation of leading open-weight and proprietary VLMs reveals that no model excels across all tasks, underscoring substantial room for improvement. We then train general-purpose 4B- and 8B-parameter models that outperform much larger VLMs in assigning rewards for short-horizon robotic tasks. Finally, we deploy the 8B-parameter reward VLM in real-robot reinforcement learning and find that it improves policy learning over Gemini Robotics-ER 1.5, a frontier physical reasoning VLM trained on robotics data, by a large margin, while substantially narrowing the gap to RL training with human-provided rewards.

TL;DR: DefVINS是一个视觉惯性里程计框架，通过显式分离刚性状态和非刚性变形来解决可变形场景中的VIO问题，利用IMU锚定和可观测性分析提高在非刚性环境下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DefVINS框架通过显式分离刚性和非刚性分量，结合IMU约束和可观测性分析，有效解决了可变形场景中的VIO问题。

Abstract: Deformable scenes violate the rigidity assumptions underpinning classical visual-inertial odometry (VIO), often leading to over-fitting to local non-rigid motion or severe drift when deformation dominates visual parallax. We introduce DefVINS, a visual-inertial odometry framework that explicitly separates a rigid, IMU-anchored state from a non--rigid warp represented by an embedded deformation graph. The system is initialized using a standard VIO procedure that fixes gravity, velocity, and IMU biases, after which non-rigid degrees of freedom are activated progressively as the estimation becomes well conditioned. An observability analysis is included to characterize how inertial measurements constrain the rigid motion and render otherwise unobservable modes identifiable in the presence of deformation. This analysis motivates the use of IMU anchoring and informs a conditioning-based activation strategy that prevents ill-posed updates under poor excitation. Ablation studies demonstrate the benefits of combining inertial constraints with observability-aware deformation activation, resulting in improved robustness under non-rigid environments.

Abstract: How do children respond to repeated robot errors? While prior research has examined adult reactions to successive robot errors, children's responses remain largely unexplored. In this study, we explore children's reactions to robot social errors and performance errors. For the latter, this study reproduces the successive robot failure paradigm of Liu et al. with child participants (N=59, ages 8-10) to examine how young users respond to repeated robot conversational errors. Participants interacted with a robot that failed to understand their prompts three times in succession, with their behavioral responses video-recorded and analyzed. We found both similarities and differences compared to adult responses from the original study. Like adults, children adjusted their prompts, modified their verbal tone, and exhibited increasingly emotional non-verbal responses throughout successive errors. However, children demonstrated more disengagement behaviors, including temporarily ignoring the robot or actively seeking an adult. Errors did not affect participants' perception of the robot, suggesting more flexible conversational expectations in children. These findings inform the design of more effective and developmentally appropriate human-robot interaction systems for young users.
