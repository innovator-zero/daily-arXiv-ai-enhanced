They have achieved striking progress, but almost all of this progress lives in virtual spaces. These systems transform embeddings and tokens, yet do not themselves touch the world and rarely admit a physical interpretation. In this work we propose a physical transformer that couples modern transformer style computation with geometric representation and physical dynamics. At the micro level, attention heads, and feed-forward blocks are modeled as interacting spins governed by effective Hamiltonians plus non-Hamiltonian bath terms. At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406Transformer\uff0c\u5c06\u73b0\u4ee3Transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u89c2\u3001\u4e2d\u89c2\u548c\u5b8f\u89c2\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0a\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6570\u5b57AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e92\u52a8\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u76f8\u7edf\u4e00\u7684AI\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e09\u5c42\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u5fae\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u524d\u9988\u7f51\u7edc\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b\u4e2d\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6d41\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\uff1b\u5b8f\u89c2\u5c42\u9762\u7ef4\u62a4\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u4f4d\u8096\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u7269\u7406Transformer\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5c0a\u91cd\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u597d\u5904\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Real websites are non-stationary and diverse, making artificial or small-scale task sets insufficient for robust policy learning. WebGym contains nearly 300,000 tasks with rubric-based evaluations across diverse, real-world websites and difficulty levels. We train agents with a simple reinforcement learning (RL) recipe, which trains on the agent's own interaction traces (rollouts), using task rewards as feedback to guide learning. To enable scaling RL, we speed up sampling of trajectories in WebGym by developing a high-throughput asynchronous rollout system, designed specifically for web agents. Our system achieves a 4-5x rollout speedup compared to naive implementations. Second, we scale the task set breadth, depth, and size, which results in continued performance improvement. Fine-tuning a strong base vision-language model, Qwen-3-VL-8B-Instruct, on WebGym results in an improvement in success rate on an out-of-distribution test set from 26.2% to 42.9%, significantly outperforming agents based on proprietary models such as GPT-4o and GPT-5-Thinking that achieve 27.1% and 29.8%, respectively.

These models consist of a forward process, which gradually diffuses the data distribution to a noise distribution spanning the whole space, and a backward process, which inverts this transformation to recover the data distribution from noise. Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution.

However, such paradigm shift introduces critical security vulnerabilities stemming from the ''embodiment gap'', a discord between the LLM's abstract reasoning and the physical, context-dependent nature of robotics. While security for text-based LLMs is an active area of research, existing solutions are often insufficient to address the unique threats for the embodied robotic agents, where malicious outputs manifest not merely as harmful text but as dangerous physical actions. In this work, we present a systematic survey, summarizing the emerging threat landscape and corresponding defense strategies for LLM-controlled robotics. Specifically, we discuss a comprehensive taxonomy of attack vectors, covering topics such as jailbreaking, backdoor attacks, and multi-modal prompt injection. In response, we analyze and categorize a range of defense mechanisms, from formal safety specifications and runtime enforcement to multi-LLM oversight and prompt hardening. Furthermore, we review key datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate the robustness of these embodied systems.

While Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) like Dense-Unet have shown promise in removing these artifacts via inpainting, they often require large labeled datasets which are scarce in the medical domain. Inspired by recent advancements in Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for 3D point clouds, we propose \\textbf{Dense-MAE}, a novel self-supervised learning framework for volumetric medical data. We introduce a pre-training strategy that randomly masks 3D patches of the vessel lumen and trains the Dense-Unet to reconstruct the missing geometry.

Traditional physical world models (PWM) focus on quantifiable physical attributes such as space and motion, failing to meet the needs of social intelligence modeling. In contrast, the Mental World Model (MWM), as a structured representation of humans' internal mental states, has become the critical cognitive foundation for embodied agents to achieve natural human-machine collaboration and dynamic social adaptation. However, current MWM research faces significant bottlenecks: such as fragmented conceptual framework with vague boundaries between MWM and PWM, disjointed reasoning mechanisms for the technical pathways and applicable scenarios of different Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning paradigms, and detachment between evaluation and practice.\n  To address these issues, this review systematically synthesizes over 100 authoritative studies to provide a comprehensive overview of MWM research for embodied AI. Its core contributions are threefold: First, it constructs a complete theoretical framework for MWM for the first time. Specifically, it distinguishes the essential differences between MWM and PWMs. Second, it systematically defines the key components of MWM through two paradigms for mental element representation. Third, it comprehensively analyzes two core ToM reasoning paradigms with 19 ToM methods. Finally, it also clarifies the integration trend of neuro-symbolic hybrid architectures, and synthesizes 26 ToM evaluation benchmarks. This work aims to promote the integration of embodied agents into human society and advance the in-depth development of human-machine collaborative interaction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7100\u9879\u6743\u5a01\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Mental World Model\uff08MWM\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86MWM\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08PWM\uff09\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86MWM\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3\u5fc3\u667a\u7406\u8bba\uff08ToM\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u53ca19\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5177\u8eabAI\u4ee3\u7406\u5728\u865a\u62df\u5316\u8eab\u3001\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u5df2\u4ece\u7269\u7406\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u8f6c\u5411\u5bf9\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u6ee1\u8db3\u793e\u4f1a\u667a\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u5fc3\u667a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u5185\u90e8\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u7136\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u793e\u4f1a\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u5fc3\u667a\u5143\u7d20\u8868\u793a\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49MWM\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e24\u79cd\u6838\u5fc3ToM\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6db5\u76d619\u79cdToM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u9610\u660e\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u878d\u5408\u8d8b\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u7efc\u540826\u4e2aToM\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684MWM\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86MWM\u4e0ePWM\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b\uff1b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86MWM\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff1b\u5168\u9762\u5206\u6790\u4e86ToM\u63a8\u7406\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u65e8\u5728\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5177\u8eab\u4ee3\u7406\u878d\u5165\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u524dMWM\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u8131\u8282\u7b49\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

EGxFSL integrates radiologist-defined regions-of-interest as spatial supervision via Grad-CAM-based Dice loss, jointly optimized with prototypical classification for interpretable few-shot learning. xGAL introduces iterative sample acquisition prioritizing both predictive uncertainty and attention misalignment, creating a closed-loop framework where explainability guides training and sample selection synergistically. On the BraTS (MRI), VinDr-CXR (chest X-ray), and SIIM-COVID-19 (chest X-ray) datasets, we achieve accuracies of 92\\%, 76\\%, and 62\\%, respectively, consistently outperforming non-guided baselines across all datasets. Under severe data constraints, xGAL achieves 76\\% accuracy with only 680 samples versus 57\\% for random sampling.

This observation has led researchers towards identifying elementary building blocks of motion known as movement primitives, which are well-suited for generating motor commands in autonomous systems, such as robots. In this survey, we provide an encyclopedic overview of movement primitive approaches and applications in chronological order. Concretely, we present movement primitive frameworks as a way of representing robotic control trajectories acquired through human demonstrations. Within the area of robotics, movement primitives can encode basic motions at the trajectory level, such as how a robot would grasp a cup or the sequence of motions necessary to toss a ball. Furthermore, movement primitives have been developed with the desirable analytical properties of a spring-damper system, probabilistic coupling of multiple demonstrations, using neural networks in high-dimensional systems, and more, to address difficult challenges in robotics. Although movement primitives have widespread application to a variety of fields, the goal of this survey is to inform practitioners on the use of these frameworks in the context of robotics. Specifically, we aim to (i) present a systematic review of major movement primitive frameworks and examine their strengths and weaknesses; (ii) highlight applications that have successfully made use of movement primitives; and (iii) examine open questions and discuss practical challenges when applying movement primitives in robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\uff08movement primitives\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u767e\u79d1\u5168\u4e66\u5f0f\u7684\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u8ba8\u8bba\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u8fd0\u52a8\u6bb5\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u8fd9\u542f\u53d1\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u8bc6\u522b\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff09\u751f\u6210\u8fd0\u52a8\u547d\u4ee4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u5757\u3002", "method": "\u6309\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u6982\u8ff0\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f39\u7c27\u963b\u5c3c\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u591a\u6f14\u793a\u6982\u7387\u8026\u5408\u3001\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7cfb\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u4f18\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u80fd\u591f\u7f16\u7801\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u57fa\u672c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u6293\u53d6\u676f\u5b50\u3001\u629b\u7403\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5df2\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u9886\u57df\u6210\u529f\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd0\u52a8\u57fa\u5143\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u524d\u666f\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6311\u6218\u548c\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

This hybrid training strategy effectively harnesses the diversity of synthetic simulation data while minimizing the sim-to-real gap. We evaluated InternVLA-A1 across 12 real-world robotic tasks and simulation benchmark.

Secondly, most studies focus only on the consistency of inter-modal feature information, neglecting the differences between features, resulting in inadequate feature information fusion. In this paper, we first extract multi-channel features to obtain more comprehensive feature information. We employ dual-channel features in both the visual and auditory modalities to enhance intra-modal feature representation. Secondly, we propose a symmetric mutual promotion (SMP) inter-modal feature fusion method. This method combines symmetric cross-modal attention mechanisms and self-attention mechanisms, where the cross-modal attention mechanism captures useful information from other modalities, and the self-attention mechanism models contextual information. This approach promotes the exchange of useful information between modalities, thereby strengthening inter-modal interactions. Furthermore, we integrate intra-modal features and inter-modal fused features, fully leveraging the complementarity of inter-modal feature information while considering feature information differences. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e92\u4fc3\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5bf9\u79f0\u4ea4\u53c9\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u4e0d\u591f\u4e30\u5bcc\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u901a\u9053\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e92\u4fc3\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u4ea4\u53c9\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1b3. \u6574\u5408\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6539\u5584\u6a21\u6001\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For molecular property prediction, SMILES-based NTP scales well but lacks explicit topology, whereas graph-native masked modeling captures connectivity but risks disrupting the pivotal chemical details (e.g., activity cliffs). CamS bridges this gap by serializing molecular graphs into structure-rich causal sequences. CamS first mines data-driven connection-aware motifs. It then serializes motifs via scaffold-rooted breadth-first search (BFS) to establish a stable core-to-periphery order. Crucially, CamS enables hierarchical modeling by concatenating sequences from fine to coarse motif scales, allowing the model to condition global scaffolds on dense, uncorrupted local structural evidence. We instantiate CamS-LLaMA by pre-training a vanilla LLaMA backbone on CamS sequences. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on MoleculeNet and the activity-cliff benchmark MoleculeACE, outperforming both SMILES-based language models and strong graph baselines.

We formalize these complexities into a new class of problems, dubbed Spatio-Temporal Efficacy-optimized Allocation for Multi-robot systems (STEAM). STEAM builds upon trait-based frameworks that model robots using their capabilities (e.g., payload and speed), but goes beyond the typical binary success-failure model by explicitly modeling the efficacy of allocations as trait-efficacy maps. These maps encode how the aggregated capabilities assigned to a task determine performance. Further, STEAM accommodates spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). To solve STEAM problems, we contribute a novel algorithm named Efficacy-optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (E-ITAGS) that simultaneously optimizes task performance and respects time budgets by interleaving task allocation, scheduling, and path planning. Motivated by the fact that trait-efficacy maps are difficult, if not impossible, to specify, E-ITAGS efficiently learns them using a realizability-aware active learning module. Our approach is realizability-aware since it explicitly accounts for the fact that not all combinations of traits are realizable by the robots available during learning. Further, we derive experimentally-validated bounds on E-ITAGS' suboptimality with respect to efficacy. Detailed numerical simulations and experiments using an emergency response domain demonstrate that E-ITAGS generates allocations of higher efficacy compared to baselines, while respecting resource and spatio-temporal constraints. We also show that our active learning approach is sample efficient and establishes a principled tradeoff between data and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86STEAM\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\u548cE-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "motivation": "\u590d\u6742\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u3001\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u6210\u529f-\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTEAM\u95ee\u9898\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1E-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u91cf\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u56fe\u641c\u7d22\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u80fd\u548c\u6ee1\u8db3\u65f6\u95f4\u9884\u7b97\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5e94\u6025\u54cd\u5e94\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cE-ITAGS\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u6548\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "STEAM\u6846\u67b6\u548cE-ITAGS\u7b97\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u6548\u80fd\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee1\u8db3\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we propose the CoCoT (Collaborative Coross-modal Thought) frame- work, built upon two key innovations: a) Dynamic Multi-Region Grounding to adaptively detect the most relevant image regions based on the question, and b) Relation-Aware Reasoning to enable multi-region collaboration by iteratively align- ing visual cues to form a coherent and logical chain of thought. Through this approach, we construct the CoCoT-70K dataset, comprising 74,691 high-quality samples with multi-region annotations and structured reasoning chains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoCoT significantly enhances complex visual rea- soning, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 15.4% on LLaVA-1.5 and 4.0% on Qwen2-VL across six challenging benchmarks.

We first observe that the model's NCMI is inversely proportional to its accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce an alternating algorithm to efficiently minimize the NCMI. Across image recognition and whole-slide imaging (WSI) subtyping benchmarks, NCMI-trained models surpass state of the art losses by substantial margins at a computational cost comparable to that of CE. Notably, on ImageNet, NCMI yields a 2.77% top-1 accuracy improvement with ResNet-50 comparing to the CE; on CAMELYON-17, replacing CE with NCMI improves the macro-F1 by 8.6% over the strongest baseline.

A key assumption in these works is that the goal region is reachable; an assumption that often fails in practice when environments are disconnected. Motivated by this limitation, we consider known 3D environments comprising objects, also called blocks, that form distinct navigable support surfaces (planes), and that are either non-movable (e.g., tables) or movable (e.g., boxes). These surfaces may be mutually disconnected due to height differences, holes, or lateral separations. Our focus is on tasks where the robot must reach a goal region residing on an elevated plane that is unreachable. Rather than declaring such tasks infeasible, an effective strategy is to enable the robot to interact with the environment, rearranging movable objects to create new traversable connections; a problem known as Navigation Among Movable Objects (NAMO). Existing NAMO planners typically address 2D environments, where obstacles are pushed aside to clear a path. These methods cannot directly handle the considered 3D setting; in such cases, obstacles must be placed strategically to bridge these physical disconnections. We address this challenge by developing BRiDGE (Block-based Reconfiguration in Disconnected 3D Geometric Environments), a sampling-based planner that incrementally builds trees over robot and object configurations to compute feasible plans specifying which objects to move, where to place them, and in what order, while accounting for a limited number of movable objects. To accelerate planning, we introduce non-uniform sampling strategies. We show that our method is probabilistically complete and we provide extensive numerical and hardware experiments validating its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "BRiDGE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b33D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u65e0\u6cd5\u5230\u8fbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u6765\u521b\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u7a7f\u8d8a\u8fde\u63a5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u53ef\u8fbe\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u96453D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5dee\u3001\u5b54\u6d1e\u6216\u6a2a\u5411\u5206\u79bb\u7b49\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8868\u9762\u53ef\u80fd\u76f8\u4e92\u65ad\u5f00\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u74063D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1BRiDGE\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u589e\u91cf\u6784\u5efa\u6811\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u79fb\u52a8\u54ea\u4e9b\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u653e\u7f6e\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u52a0\u901f\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u662f\u6982\u7387\u5b8c\u5907\u7684\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u91cf\u6570\u503c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "BRiDGE\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b33D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u65ad\u5f00\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fbe\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u65b0\u914d\u7f6e\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

To this end, we present the Conformal Bayesian Dermatological Classifier (CBDC), a well, founded framework that combines Statistical Learning Theory, Topological Data Analysis (TDA), and Bayesian Conformal Inference.

While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has shown strong performance, it often fails to adapt to real-world short-term distribution shifts, which arise as different batches of goods arrive sequentially, causing performance drops. We argue that the short-term lookahead information available in modern logistics systems is key to mitigating this issue, especially during distribution shifts. We formulate online 3D-BP with lookahead parcels as a Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem and adapt the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework to solve it. Our framework employs a dynamic exploration prior that automatically balances a learned RL policy and a robust random policy based on the lookahead characteristics. Additionally, we design an auxiliary reward to penalize long-term spatial waste from individual placements.

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "TAP-ViTs\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94ViT\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7GMM\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u4f20\u5b9e\u73b0\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u5b9a\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbf\u95ee\u539f\u59cb\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ViT\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5ffd\u7565\u8bbe\u5907\u5f02\u6784\u6027\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u5907\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u526a\u679d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eGMM\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u4f20GMM\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u4e91\u7aef\u4ece\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5206\u5e03\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6784\u5efa\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u6d4b\u91cf\u590d\u5408\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5c42\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aViT\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cTAP-ViTs\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u538b\u7f29\u6bd4\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TAP-ViTs\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0aViT\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e0b\u7684\u8bbe\u5907\u7279\u5b9a\u526a\u679d\u3002"}}

LendNova transforms risk modeling by operating directly on raw, jargon-heavy credit bureau text using a language model that learns task-relevant representations without manual feature engineering. By automatically capturing patterns and risk signals embedded in the text, it replaces manual preprocessing steps, reducing costs and improving scalability.

Traditional safety frameworks treat contact as unsafe, restricting robots to collision avoidance and limiting their ability to function in dense, everyday settings. As the number of objects grows, model-based approaches for safe manipulation become computationally intractable; meanwhile, learned methods typically tie safety to the task at hand, making them hard to transfer to new tasks without retraining. In this work we introduce Dense Contact Barrier Functions(DCBF). Our approach bypasses the computational complexity of explicitly modeling multi-object dynamics by instead learning a composable, object-centric function that implicitly captures the safety constraints arising from physical interactions. Trained offline on interactions with a few objects, the learned DCBFcomposes across arbitrary object sets at runtime, producing a single global safety filter that scales linearly and transfers across tasks without retraining. We validate our approach through simulated experiments in dense clutter, demonstrating its ability to enable collision-free navigation and safe, contact-rich interaction in suitable settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Dense Contact Barrier Functions (DCBF)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u9690\u5f0f\u6355\u83b7\u7269\u7406\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u63a5\u89e6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u63a5\u89e6\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u65e5\u5e38\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u968f\u7740\u7269\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u800c\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u7279\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\u7ed1\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDense Contact Barrier Functions (DCBF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u5c11\u91cf\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u53ef\u7ec4\u5408\u3001\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5c06\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u7269\u4f53\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5b89\u5168\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u6742\u4e71\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u78b0\u649e\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "DCBF\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c-\u5206\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6587\u672c\u80fd\u5728\u591a\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u5206\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c-\u5206\u6570\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\uff1a\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u3001\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08PLCC/SRCC\u5dee\u5f02\u7f29\u5c0f\u52300.02/0.03\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u8303\u5f0f\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8303\u5f0f\u6548\u679c\u8f83\u5dee\u4f46\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u76f2\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u81ea\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8303\u5f0f\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a threat detection framework based on machine learning that can be used to classify malicious behavior in the social media network environment based on the nature of network traffic. Exploiting a rich network traffic dataset, the massive preprocessing and exploratory data analysis is conducted to overcome the problem of data imbalance, feature inconsistency, and noise. A model of artificial neural network (ANN) is then created to acquire intricate, non-linear tendencies of malicious actions.

In recent years, the development of robotic foundation models has become increasingly active, leading to the continuous proposal of various manipulators to support these models. However, none of these manipulators share exactly the same structure, as the order of joints and the ratio of link lengths differ among robots.

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty.

We propose a method to improve loop closure performance in DPV-SLAM. Our approach integrates AnyLoc, a learning-based visual place recognition technique, as a replacement for the classical Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) loop detection method. In contrast to BoVW, which relies on handcrafted features, AnyLoc utilizes deep feature representations, enabling more robust image retrieval across diverse viewpoints and lighting conditions.

Traditional long-range forecasting, whether statistical or dynamical, has predominantly focused on predicting a single, spatially-averaged seasonal value, lacking the spatial detail essential for regional-level resource management. To address this gap, we introduce a novel deep learning framework that reframes gridded monsoon prediction as a spatio-temporal computer vision task. We treat multi-variable, pre-monsoon atmospheric and oceanic fields as a sequence of multi-channel images, effectively creating a video-like input tensor. Using 85 years of ERA5 reanalysis data for predictors and IMD rainfall data for targets, we employ a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture to learn the complex mapping from the five-month pre-monsoon period (January-May) to a high-resolution gridded rainfall pattern for the subsequent monsoon season.

Noise correlation, which estimates gradients by correlating perturbations of activity with changes in output, provides a biologically plausible solution to credit assignment but scales poorly as accurately estimating the Jacobian requires that the number of perturbations scale with network size. Moreover, isotropic noise conflicts with neurobiological observations that neural activity lies on a low-dimensional manifold. To address these drawbacks, we propose neural manifold noise correlation (NMNC), which performs credit assignment using perturbations restricted to the neural manifold. We show theoretically and empirically that the Jacobian row space aligns with the neural manifold in trained networks, and that manifold dimensionality scales slowly with network size. NMNC substantially improves performance and sample efficiency over vanilla noise correlation in convolutional networks trained on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-scale models, and recurrent networks. NMNC also yields representations more similar to the primate visual system than vanilla noise correlation. These findings offer a mechanistic hypothesis for how biological circuits could support credit assignment, and suggest that biologically inspired constraints may enable, rather than limit, effective learning at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u6d41\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\uff08NMNC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u6270\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff1b2\uff09\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u566a\u58f0\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u6d3b\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u4e8e\u4f4e\u7ef4\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u89c2\u5bdf\u76f8\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u6d41\u5f62\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\uff08NMNC\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6270\u52a8\u9650\u5236\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u6765\u6267\u884c\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0e\u795e\u7ecf\u6d41\u5f62\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e14\u6d41\u5f62\u7ef4\u5ea6\u968f\u7f51\u7edc\u89c4\u6a21\u7f13\u6162\u589e\u957f\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u7684\u5377\u79ef\u7f51\u7edc\u3001ImageNet\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5faa\u73af\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\uff0cNMNC\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002NMNC\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u7075\u957f\u7c7b\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u76f8\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u56de\u8def\u5982\u4f55\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u800c\u975e\u9650\u5236\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

At first, unknown dynamic effects on the closed-loop model are learned and treated as residuals of the nominal dynamics, jointly forming a hybrid model. We show that learning with analytic gradients can be achieved using only trajectory-level data while enjoying accurate long-horizon prediction with an arbitrary integration step size. Subsequently, a trajectory optimizer is developed to compute the optimal reference trajectory with the residual physics along it minimized.

Under review for a MELBA Special Issue. Minor revision resubmitted; decision pending", "summary": "Routine clinical imaging of the retina using optical coherence tomography (OCT) is performed with large slice spacing, resulting in highly anisotropic images and a sparsely scanned retina. Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases. Our resolution-independent frameworks facilitate the analysis of OCT images with large B-scan distances, opening up possibilities for the volumetric evaluation of retinal structures and pathologies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9690\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\uff08INR\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u7f51\u819cOCT\u56fe\u50cf\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c63D\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u4e34\u5e8aOCT\u6210\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf2D\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u8bc1\u76f8\u90bbB\u626b\u63cf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002INR\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u8868\u793a\u7279\u6027\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5229\u7528en-face\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884cB\u626b\u63cf\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u5f62\u72b6\u8868\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5927B\u626b\u63cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684OCT\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u7684\u5bb9\u79ef\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "INR-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86OCT\u56fe\u50cf\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u626b\u63cf\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u7684\u5bc6\u96c63D\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Building on insights from prioritized replay in deep RL, as well as prior observations that rollouts with intermediate success rates tend to produce stronger learning signals under methods such as GRPO, our approach selects problems according to a simple, model-driven priority score derived from empirical success statistics. In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting.

Existing meta-learning-based approaches require a shared representation of environmental structures, which lack flexibility for realistic non-structural disturbances. Besides, representation error and the distribution shifts can lead to heavy degradation in prediction accuracy. This work presents a generalizable disturbance estimation framework that builds on meta-learning and feedback-calibrated online adaptation. By extracting features from a finite time window of past observations, a unified representation that effectively captures general non-structural disturbances can be learned without predefined structural assumptions. The online adaptation process is subsequently calibrated by a state-feedback mechanism to attenuate the learning residual originating from the representation and generalizability limitations. Theoretical analysis shows that simultaneous convergence of both the online learning error and the disturbance estimation error can be achieved. Through the unified meta-representation, our framework effectively estimates multiple rapidly changing disturbances, as demonstrated by quadrotor flight experiments.

Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms. This encourages a more compact representation and also facilitates efficient computation. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of SpikingGPF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08SpikingGPF\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\u6765\u514b\u670d\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u660e\u663e\u5197\u4f59\u4e14\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5229\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "method": "SpikingGPF\u91c7\u7528\u8109\u51b2\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u67b6\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u63d0\u793a\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u793a\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8868\u793a\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8282\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u63d0\u793a\u539f\u5b50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u8868\u793a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86SpikingGPF\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SpikingGPF\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u8282\u70b9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This work presents a novel multi-modal EPW control system designed to prioritize patient needs while allowing seamless switching between control modes. Four complementary interfaces, namely joystick, speech, hand gesture, and electrooculography (EOG), are integrated with a continuous vital sign monitoring framework measuring heart rate variability, oxygen saturation (SpO2), and skin temperature. This combination enables greater patient independence while allowing caregivers to maintain real-time supervision and early intervention capability.\n  Two-point calibration of the biophysical sensors against clinical reference devices resulted in root mean square errors of at most 2 bpm for heart rate, 0.5 degree Celsius for skin temperature, and 1 percent for SpO2. Experimental evaluation involved twenty participants with mobility impairments executing a total of 500 indoor navigation commands. The achieved command recognition accuracies were 99 percent for joystick control, 97 percent plus or minus 2 percent for speech, and 95 percent plus or minus 3 percent for hand gesture, with an average closed-loop latency of 20 plus or minus 0.5 milliseconds. Caregivers receive real-time alerts through an Android application following encrypted cloud transmission of physiological data.

This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c063D CT\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9885\u5185\u51fa\u8840\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7YOLO\u67b6\u6784\u548cByteTrack\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a3D\u5377\u79ef\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7684\u9ad8\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u79fb\u52a8\u5352\u4e2d\u5355\u5143\u548c\u8fdc\u7a0b\u8bca\u6240\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u65f6\u60a3\u8005\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u4f53\u79efCT\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528YOLO\u67b6\u6784\uff08v8\u3001v10\u3001v11\u3001v12\uff09\u7684Nano\u914d\u7f6e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u9aa8\u5e72\u7f51\u7edc\uff0c\u5f15\u5165ByteTrack\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u89e3\u5256\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u72ec\u7acb\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4ece0.703\u63d0\u9ad8\u52300.779\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ee5\u6781\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fd1\u4f3c3D\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u60a3\u8005\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u89c6\u89d2\u8303\u5f0f\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e862D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c3D\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "MAFS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5728\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5efa\u6a21\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff1b\u5355\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u7ea7\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u5f81\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "method": "MAFS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u7a33\u5b9a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u5934\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u89d2\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u68c0\u67e5\u7279\u5f81\uff1b3\uff09\u91cd\u6392\u5e8f\u6a21\u5757\u6574\u5408\u5404\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u5e76\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u764c\u75c7\u57fa\u56e0\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u6570\u636e\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cMAFS\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MAFS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary \"facts\" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aMovieRecapsQA\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7535\u5f71\u91cd\u8ff0\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7ea68.2K\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u5927\u591a\u975e\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b54\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u6574\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7ebf\u7d22\u6765\u56de\u7b54\u590d\u6742\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7535\u5f71\u91cd\u8ff0\u89c6\u9891\uff08YouTube\u4e0a\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u6a21\u6001\u603b\u7ed3\u7535\u5f71\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cd\u8ff0\u6458\u8981\u751f\u6210\u95ee\u9898-\u7b54\u6848\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u6240\u9700\u7684\"\u4e8b\u5b9e\"\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f307\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdbMLLMs\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\uff1b3\uff09\u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u4ecd\u56f0\u96be\uff1b4\uff09\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieRecapsQA\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u5f0fVideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u957f\u5ea6\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

We close this gap with a practical sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework that utilizes dense tactile feedback combined with joint torque sensing to explicitly regulate physical interactions. To enable effective sim-to-real transfer, we introduce (i) a computationally fast tactile simulation that computes distances between dense virtual tactile units and the object via parallel forward kinematics, providing high-rate, high-resolution touch signals needed by RL; (ii) a current-to-torque calibration that eliminates the need for torque sensors on dexterous hands by mapping motor current to joint torque; and (iii) actuator dynamics modeling to bridge the actuation gaps with randomization of non-ideal effects such as backlash, torque-speed saturation. Using an asymmetric actor-critic PPO pipeline trained entirely in simulation, our policies deploy directly to a five-finger hand. The resulting policies demonstrated two essential skills: (1) command-based, controllable grasp force tracking, and (2) reorientation of objects in the hand, both of which were robustly executed without fine-tuning on the robot. By combining tactile and torque in the observation space with effective sensing/actuation modeling, our system provides a practical solution to achieve reliable dexterous manipulation.

Such image manipulations can be produced using traditional image editing tools (known as \"shallowfakes\") or advanced artificial intelligence techniques (\"deepfakes\"). While numerous studies have focused on image manipulation localization on either shallowfake images or deepfake videos, few approaches address both cases. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using a deep learning network to localize manipulations in both shallow- and deep-fake images, and proposed a solution for such purpose. To precisely differentiate between authentic and manipulated pixels, we leverage the Vision Mamba network to extract feature maps that clearly describe the boundaries between tampered and untouched regions. To further enhance this separation, we propose a novel Guided Graph Neural Network (G-GNN) module that amplifies the distinction between manipulated and authentic pixels.

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5168\u5c40\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u4f4e\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u4ee3\u7406\u7f51\u7edc\u65ad\u5f00\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u4e14\u5c40\u90e8\u6c61\u67d3\u7387\u9ad8\u65f6\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u8d85\u8d8a\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6076\u610f\u653b\u51fb\uff08\u5982\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\uff09\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u8bef\u5dee\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u800c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u62d3\u6251\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f18\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f51\u7edc\u62d3\u6251\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e2d\u626e\u6f14\u91cd\u8981\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u52a0\u6743\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u5668\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8106\u5f31\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\u3002"}}

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background.

While machine learning (ML) approaches such as deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely studied to enhance OPF solution speed and performance, their practical deployment faces two critical scaling questions: What is the minimum training data volume required for reliable results? How should ML models' complexity balance accuracy with real-time computational limits? Existing studies evaluate discrete scenarios without quantifying these scaling relationships, leading to trial-and-error-based ML development in real-world applications. This work presents the first systematic scaling study for ML-based OPF across two dimensions: data scale (0.1K-40K training samples) and compute scale (multiple NN architectures with varying FLOPs). Our results reveal consistent power-law relationships on both DNNs and physics-informed NNs (PINNs) between each resource dimension and three core performance metrics: prediction error (MAE), constraint violations and speed. We find that for ACOPF, the accuracy metric scales with dataset size and training compute. These scaling laws enable predictable and principled ML pipeline design for OPF. We further identify the divergence between prediction accuracy and constraint feasibility and characterize the compute-optimal frontier.

Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization.

Conventional optimization-based controllers can enforce physical constraints, but they struggle to produce feasible solutions quickly when many obstacles are present. Diffusion models can generate diverse trajectories around obstacles, yet prior approaches lacked a general and efficient way to condition them on scene structure. In this paper, we show that combining diffusion-based warm-starting conditioned with a latent object-centric representation of the scene and with a collision-aware model predictive controller (MPC) yields reliable and efficient motion generation under strict time limits. Our approach conditions a diffusion transformer on the system state, task, and surroundings, using an object-centric slot attention mechanism to provide a compact obstacle representation suitable for control. The sampled trajectories are refined by an optimal control problem that enforces rigid-body dynamics and signed-distance collision constraints, producing feasible motions in real time. On benchmark tasks, this hybrid method achieved markedly higher success rates and lower latency than sampling-based planners or either component alone.

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings.

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation.

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.\n  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives.

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6210\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7d27\u51d1\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u521a\u6027\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u80fd\u4e22\u5f03\u4e3b\u8981\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5229\u7528Grounded SAM2\u8bc6\u522b\u524d\u666f\u7269\u4f53\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u524d\u666f\u5360\u7528\u7387\uff0c\u4ece\u4e2d\u5f97\u51fa\u7c7b\u522b\u7ea7\u8865\u4e01\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9608\u503c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u8981\u4e48\u4ece\u591a\u4e2a\u5019\u9009\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u8865\u4e01\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5728\u524d\u666f\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65f6\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u6574\u5168\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u4e3b\u8981\u7269\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u80cc\u666f\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ec4\u5408\u4e0a\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8865\u4e01\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u7559\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u84b8\u998f\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "RadioDiff-Flux\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u7528\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u4e2d\u70b9\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e6G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u57286G\u9ad8\u901f\u7f51\u7edc\u5b9e\u4f53\u548c\u5feb\u901f\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7531\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u6027\u8d28\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6f5c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u751f\u6210\u7c97\u7565\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff08\u53ef\u7f13\u5b58\u5171\u4eab\uff09\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u53d1\u5c04\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u8fdb\u884c\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u91cd\u590d\u65e9\u671f\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aRadioDiff-Flux\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe50\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5c0f\u4e8e0.15%\u3002", "conclusion": "RadioDiff-Flux\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u672a\u67656G\u7f51\u7edc\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u5730\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization.

Feedback welcome", "summary": "CTMC/DTMC-based discrete generative models, including uniform-noise discrete diffusion (e.g., D3PM/CTDD) and discrete flow matching, enable non-autoregressive sequence generation by repeatedly replacing tokens through a time-inhomogeneous Markov process. Inference is typically implemented with step-based simulation: each token decides to jump via independent Bernoulli (or categorical) draws at every discretization step. Under uniform-noise initialization, where self-correction requires multiple edits per position, these independent decisions induce substantial variance in both the number and timing of edits, leading to characteristic failure modes such as under-editing (residual noise) or over-editing (cascading unnecessary substitutions), decreasing reproducibility.\n  We propose Stratified Hazard Sampling (SHS), a drop-in and hyperparameter-free inference principle for any sampler that admits a stay-vs.-replace decomposition. SHS models per-token edits as events driven by cumulative hazard (CTMC) or cumulative jump mass (DTMC) and places events by stratifying this cumulative quantity: with a single random phase per position, a token jumps whenever its accumulated hazard crosses unit-spaced thresholds. This preserves the expected number of jumps while achieving the minimum possible variance among unbiased integer estimators (bounded by 1/4), without altering per-jump destination sampling and thus retaining multimodality. We also introduce a phase-allocation variant for blacklist-style lexical constraints that prioritizes early edits at high-risk positions to mitigate late-masking artifacts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u5206\u5c42\u5371\u9669\u91c7\u6837\uff08SHS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u57fa\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6b65\u8fdb\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5982\u6b20\u7f16\u8f91\u548c\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\u7b49\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684CTMC/DTMC\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u4f2f\u52aa\u5229\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6b65\u8fdb\u6a21\u62df\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8f91\u6b21\u6570\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u6b20\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u6b8b\u7559\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u548c\u8fc7\u7f16\u8f91\uff08\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u66ff\u6362\uff09\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u5371\u9669\u91c7\u6837\uff08SHS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7d2f\u79ef\u5371\u9669\uff08CTMC\uff09\u6216\u7d2f\u79ef\u8df3\u8dc3\u8d28\u91cf\uff08DTMC\uff09\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u6765\u653e\u7f6e\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u968f\u673a\u76f8\u4f4d\uff0c\u5f53\u7d2f\u79ef\u5371\u9669\u8d85\u8fc7\u5355\u4f4d\u95f4\u9694\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u6807\u8bb0\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "result": "SHS\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u671f\u671b\u8df3\u8dc3\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u504f\u6574\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u53ef\u80fd\u65b9\u5dee\uff08\u6709\u754c\u4e8e1/4\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6bcf\u6b21\u8df3\u8dc3\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SHS\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4efb\u4f55\u5141\u8bb8\u505c\u7559-\u66ff\u6362\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u79bb\u6563\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

The core limitation lies in the prevalent ``track-then-descend'' paradigm, which treats the platform as a passive target and forces the quadcopter to perform complex, sequential maneuvers. This paper challenges that paradigm by introducing a bi-directional cooperative landing framework that redefines the roles of the vehicle and the platform. The essential innovation is transforming the problem from a single-agent tracking challenge into a coupled system optimization. Our key insight is that the mobile platform is not merely a target, but an active agent in the landing process. It proactively tilts its surface to create an optimal, stable terminal attitude for the approaching quadcopter. This active cooperation fundamentally breaks the sequential model by parallelizing the alignment and descent phases. Concurrently, the quadcopter's planning pipeline focuses on generating a time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectory that minimizes energy consumption. This bi-directional coordination allows the system to execute the recovery in an agile manner, characterized by aggressive trajectory tracking and rapid state synchronization within transient windows. The framework's effectiveness, validated in dynamic scenarios, significantly improves the efficiency, precision, and robustness of autonomous quadrotor recovery in complex and time-constrained missions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u4f5c\u7740\u9646\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4ece\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u53f0\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u4e3a\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u521b\u9020\u6700\u4f18\u7ec8\u7aef\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u4e0b\u964d\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7740\u9646\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\"\u8ddf\u8e2a\u540e\u4e0b\u964d\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9ad8\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5c06\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u89c6\u4e3a\u88ab\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8feb\u4f7f\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u673a\u52a8\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u8303\u5f0f\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6311\u6218\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u8026\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u79fb\u52a8\u5e73\u53f0\u4e3b\u52a8\u503e\u659c\u8868\u9762\u521b\u9020\u6700\u4f18\u7ec8\u7aef\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u95f4\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3b\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u56de\u6536\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u5411\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f66\u8f86\u548c\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u6253\u7834\u4e86\u987a\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u654f\u6377\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u7740\u9646\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.\n  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\u03a9((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\u03a9((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faQNTK-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u6b63\u5207\u6838\uff08QNTK\uff09\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u673a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u591a\u81c2\u8001\u864e\u673a\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "QNTK-UCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u968f\u673a\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65f6\u51bb\u7ed3QNN\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5176\u9759\u6001QNTK\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6838\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aQNTK-UCB\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u4e3a\u03a9((TK)^3)\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178NeuralUCB\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u03a9((TK)^8)\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u91cf\u5b50\u672c\u5f81\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "QNTK\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u66f4\u9510\u5229\u7684\u8c31\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\"\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\"\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

In these challenging environments, the platform must rely exclusively on inertial sensors, leading to pure inertial navigation. However, the inherent noise and other error terms of the inertial sensors in such real-world scenarios will cause the navigation solution to drift over time. Although conventional deep-learning models have emerged as a possible approach to inertial navigation, they are inherently black-box in nature. Furthermore, they struggle to learn effectively with limited supervised sensor data and often fail to preserve physical principles. To address these limitations, we propose PiDR, a physics-informed inertial dead-reckoning framework for autonomous platforms in situations of pure inertial navigation. PiDR offers transparency by explicitly integrating inertial navigation principles into the network training process through the physics-informed residual component. PiDR plays a crucial role in mitigating abrupt trajectory deviations even under limited or sparse supervision. We evaluated PiDR on real-world datasets collected by a mobile robot and an autonomous underwater vehicle. We obtained more than 29% positioning improvement in both datasets, demonstrating the ability of PiDR to generalize different platforms operating in various environments and dynamics. Thus, PiDR offers a robust, lightweight, yet effective architecture and can be deployed on resource-constrained platforms, enabling real-time pure inertial navigation in adverse scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "PiDR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u822a\u4f4d\u63a8\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u539f\u7406\u6574\u5408\u5230\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u5e73\u53f0\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982GNSS\u4fe1\u53f7\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9700\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u4f46\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bfc\u822a\u89e3\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u9ed1\u76d2\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u6709\u9650\u76d1\u7763\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPiDR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u6b8b\u5dee\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c06\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u539f\u7406\u660e\u786e\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7f51\u7edc\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u8f68\u8ff9\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u79fb\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u81ea\u4e3b\u6c34\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc729%\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePiDR\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u5e73\u53f0\u548c\u73af\u5883\u3002", "conclusion": "PiDR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u7eaf\u60ef\u6027\u5bfc\u822a\u3002"}}

We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy. We evaluate on a comprehensive benchmark comprising 12 datasets spanning object-scale, indoor, and outdoor scenes, including cross-sensor registration between heterogeneous LiDAR configurations. Results demonstrate that our approach generalizes effectively without manual tuning or prior knowledge of test domains.

The study aims to develop a robust regression model that can generalize across domains by training on 60 second labeled sequences of 1 Hz surface drilling data to predict the SSI. The model is tested in wells that are different from those used during training. To fine-tune the model architecture, a grid search approach is employed to optimize key hyperparameters. A comparative analysis of the Adversarial Domain Generalization (ADG), Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) and baseline models is presented, along with an evaluation of the effectiveness of transfer learning (TL) in improving model performance. The ADG and IRM models achieve performance improvements of 10% and 8%, respectively, over the baseline model. Most importantly, severe events are detected 60% of the time, against 20% for the baseline model.

Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7cfb\u7edfSOP\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5728\u7ebf\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u3001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8230\u961f\u6301\u7eed\u6536\u96c6\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5e76\u5f02\u6b65\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VLA\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u79bb\u7ebf\u3001\u5355\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u4ece\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "SOP\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8230\u961f\u7684\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u3002\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6301\u7eed\u6d41\u5f0f\u4f20\u8f93\u5728\u7ebf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5e72\u9884\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u4e91\u5b66\u4e60\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u5f02\u6b65\u63a5\u6536\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e24\u79cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u62ec\u5e03\u6599\u6298\u53e0\u3001\u7bb1\u5b50\u7ec4\u88c5\u548c\u6742\u8d27\u8865\u8d27\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSOP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLA\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u5171\u4eab\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u6709\u6548\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u5728\u6570\u5c0f\u65f6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5185\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u91cf\u63a5\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8230\u961f\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\u7d27\u5bc6\u8026\u5408\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002SOP\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios. While verifying the effectiveness of RPIQ for deployment in real assistive systems, this study also advances the computational efficiency and reliability of large models, enabling them to provide visually impaired users with the required information accurately and rapidly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRPIQ\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u534f\u4f5c\u95ed\u73af\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6821\u51c6\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c06\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u52304\u4f4d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u801760%-75%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u548c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f85\u52a9\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u5927\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u5757\u95f4\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u5b9e\u4f8b\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u9ad8\u65af-\u8d5b\u5fb7\u5c14\u8fed\u4ee3\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u591a\u534f\u4f5c\u95ed\u73af\u8865\u507f\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRPIQ\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "result": "\u5728OPT\u3001Qwen\u3001LLaMA\u7b49\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cCogVLM2\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRPIQ\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u801760%-75%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RPIQ\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u969c\u788d\u7528\u6237\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u670d\u52a1\u3002"}}

However, the nonlinear programs approximating the OCPs are inherently nonconvex due to the coupling between the dynamics and the event timing, and therefore, they are challenging to solve. Most approaches address this challenge by predefining waypoint times or just using nonconvex trajectory optimization, which simplifies the problem but often yields suboptimal solutions. To significantly improve the numerical properties, we propose a formulation with a time-scaling direct multiple shooting scheme that partitions the prediction horizon into segments aligned with characteristic time constraints. Moreover, we develop a fast semidefinite-programming-based convex relaxation that exploits the sparsity pattern of the lifted formulation. Comprehensive simulation studies demonstrate the solution optimality and computational efficiency.

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration.

Existing solutions face a dilemma: manual prompt engineering is intuitive but unscalable and imprecise, while automatic optimization methods are effective but operate as \"black boxes\" with no interpretable connection to model internals. We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts.

Existing explainability approaches in robotics typically either focus on individual modules, which can be difficult to query from the perspective of high-level behaviour, or employ monolithic approaches, which do not exploit the modularity of robotic architectures. We present HEXAR (Hierarchical EXplainability Architecture for Robots), a novel framework that provides a plug-in, hierarchical approach to generate explanations about robotic systems. HEXAR consists of specialised component explainers using diverse explanation techniques (e.g., LLM-based reasoning, causal models, feature importance, etc) tailored to specific robot modules, orchestrated by an explainer selector that chooses the most appropriate one for a given query. We implement and evaluate HEXAR on a TIAGo robot performing assistive tasks in a home environment, comparing it against end-to-end and aggregated baseline approaches across 180 scenario-query variations. We observe that HEXAR significantly outperforms baselines in root cause identification, incorrect information exclusion, and runtime, offering a promising direction for transparent autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "HEXAR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5668\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6392\u9664\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u5173\u6ce8\u96be\u4ee5\u4ece\u9ad8\u5c42\u884c\u4e3a\u89d2\u5ea6\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u91c7\u7528\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u67b6\u6784\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHEXAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\uff0c\u7531\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u67e5\u8be2\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u5668\u3002\u5728TIAGo\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u5bb6\u5ead\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u5728180\u4e2a\u573a\u666f-\u67e5\u8be2\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0cHEXAR\u5728\u6839\u56e0\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u6392\u9664\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u548c\u805a\u5408\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "HEXAR\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u548c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Code:https://github.com/ChangPtR/AbdMLLM", "summary": "Visual abductive reasoning (VAR) is a challenging task that requires AI systems to infer the most likely explanation for incomplete visual observations. While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to \"imagine\" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faAbductiveMLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u8fd9\u79cd\u53cc\u6a21\u6001\u884c\u4e3a\u6765\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAbductiveMLLM\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u534f\u540c\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aREASONER\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u57df\u63a2\u7d22\u53ef\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u56e0\u679c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4fee\u526a\u5047\u8bbe\uff1bIMAGINER\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\"\u60f3\u8c61\"\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u3002\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4ee5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u5f0f\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6VAR\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAbductiveMLLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u5148\u8fdb\u7684MLLMs\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e2d\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aMLLMs\u7684\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u6eaf\u56e0\u63a8\u7406\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While LLMs have been applied to molecular simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), existing methodologies typically address single tasks, such as precursor prediction. We introduce ChemBART, a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained on chemical reactions, which enables a unified model for multiple downstream chemical tasks--achieving the paradigm of \"one model, one pre-training, multiple tasks.\" By leveraging outputs from a mask-filling pre-training task on reaction expressions, ChemBART effectively solves a variety of chemical problems, including precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, molecular property classification, and optimizing the policy and value functions within a reinforcement learning framework, integrated with Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis route design. Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks.

The controller is formulated in the dual quaternion framework and operates at the velocity level, assuming direct command of angular and linear velocities, as is standard in many aerial vehicles and omnidirectional mobile robots. Gaussian Process (GP) regression is integrated into a geometric feedback law to learn and compensate online for unknown, state-dependent disturbances and modeling imperfections affecting both attitude and position, while preserving the algebraic structure and coupling properties inherent to rigid-body motion.\n  The proposed approach does not rely on explicit parametric models of the unknown effects, making it well-suited for robotic systems subject to sensor-induced disturbances, unmodeled actuation couplings, and environmental uncertainties. A Lyapunov-based analysis establishes probabilistic ultimate boundedness of the pose tracking error under bounded GP uncertainty, providing formal stability guarantees for the learning-based controller.\n  Simulation results demonstrate accurate and smooth trajectory tracking in the presence of realistic, localized disturbances, including correlated rotational and translational effects arising from magnetometer perturbations.

To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance.

While existing production systems excel at holistic route-level dependency modeling, they struggle to capture city-scale traffic dynamics and long-tail scenarios, leading to unreliable predictions in large urban networks. In this paper, we propose \\model, a scalable and adaptive framework that synergistically integrates link-level modeling with industrial route-level TTE systems. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal external attention module to capture global traffic dynamic dependencies across million-scale road networks efficiently. Moreover, we construct a stabilized graph mixture-of-experts network to handle heterogeneous traffic patterns while maintaining inference efficiency.

We present a practical framework that constructs high-quality digital twins within minutes from sparse RGB inputs. Our system employs 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for fast, photorealistic reconstruction as a unified scene representation. We enhance 3DGS with visibility-aware semantic fusion for accurate 3D labelling and introduce an efficient, filter-based geometry conversion method to produce collision-ready models seamlessly integrated with a Unity-ROS2-MoveIt physics engine. In experiments with a Franka Emika Panda robot performing pick-and-place tasks, we demonstrate that this enhanced geometric accuracy effectively supports robust manipulation in real-world trials.

Its input style conditions typically include text, style image, and stylized first frame. Each condition has a characteristic advantage: text is more flexible, style image provides a more accurate visual anchor, and stylized first frame makes long-video stylization feasible. However, existing methods are largely confined to a single type of style condition, which limits their scope of application. Additionally, their lack of high-quality datasets leads to style inconsistency and temporal flicker. To address these limitations, we introduce DreamStyle, a unified framework for video stylization, supporting (1) text-guided, (2) style-image-guided, and (3) first-frame-guided video stylization, accompanied by a well-designed data curation pipeline to acquire high-quality paired video data. DreamStyle is built on a vanilla Image-to-Video (I2V) model and trained using a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) with token-specific up matrices that reduces the confusion among different condition tokens.

We address this by placing a code-oriented LLM within a closed-loop synthesis framework, analyzing its evolution over 22 supervised fine-tuning cycles. The model synthesizes PyTorch convolutional networks which are validated, evaluated via low-fidelity performance signals (single-epoch accuracy), and filtered using a MinHash-Jaccard criterion to prevent structural redundancy. High-performing, novel architectures are converted into prompt-code pairs for iterative fine-tuning via parameter-efficient LoRA adaptation, initialized from the LEMUR dataset. Across cycles, the LLM internalizes empirical architectural priors, becoming a robust generator.

Unlike existing siloed tools where pattern software guarantees sewable outputs but understands nothing about drape, and physics simulation predicts behaviour but cannot automatically fix patterns, Textile IR provides the semantic glue for integration through a seven-layer Verification Ladder -- from cheap syntactic checks (pattern closure, seam compatibility) to expensive physics validation (drape simulation, stress analysis). The architecture enables bidirectional feedback: simulation failures suggest pattern modifications; material substitutions update sustainability estimates in real time; uncertainty propagates across the pipeline with explicit confidence bounds. We formalise fashion engineering as constraint satisfaction over three domains and demonstrate how Textile IR's scene-graph representation enables AI systems to manipulate garments as structured programs rather than pixel arrays. The framework addresses the compound uncertainty problem: when measurement errors in material testing, simulation approximations, and LCA database gaps combine, sustainability claims become unreliable without explicit uncertainty tracking. We propose six research priorities and discuss deployment considerations for fashion SMEs where integrated workflows reduce specialised engineering requirements.

We study the problem of constructing a conformal prediction set that is uniformly valid across multiple, heterogeneous distributions, in the sense that no matter which distribution the test point is from, the coverage of the prediction set is guaranteed to exceed a pre-specified level. We first propose a max-p aggregation scheme that delivers finite-sample, multi-distribution coverage given any conformity scores associated with each distribution. Upon studying several efficiency optimization programs subject to uniform coverage, we prove the optimality and tightness of our aggregation scheme, and propose a general algorithm to learn conformity scores that lead to efficient prediction sets after the aggregation under standard conditions. We discuss how our framework relates to group-wise distributionally robust optimization, sub-population shift, fairness, and multi-source learning.

Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions.

However, compared with the commonly used Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) staining, IHC staining involves complex procedures and is both time-consuming and expensive, which limits its widespread clinical use. Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining. Specifically, we introduce a Topology-aware Consistency Matching (TACM) mechanism that employs graph contrastive learning and topological perturbations to learn robust matching patterns despite spatial misalignments, ensuring structural consistency. Furthermore, we propose a Topology-constrained Pathological Matching (TCPM) mechanism that aligns pathological positive regions based on node importance to enhance pathological consistency.

We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u6d41\u5f62\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08CMF\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5728\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0d\u53d8\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9759\u6001\u70b9\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u626d\u66f2\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165CMF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u7531\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u5b9a\u4e49\uff09\u5728\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u89c4\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4eba\u53e3\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff08SCMs\uff09\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CMF\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5b83\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u654f\u611f\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "CMF\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "SketchThinker-R1\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1164%\u7684token\u6210\u672c\u4e14\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\uff08token\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u52a0\u9ad8\u6548\u7b80\u6d01", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) Sketch-Mode\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3SketchJudge\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3) \u5728SketchJudge\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSketchThinker-R1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc764%\u7684\u63a8\u7406token\u6210\u672c\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22"}}

If successful, this approach offers one of the most promising routes for human oversight in AI safety. We conduct an initial stress-test of these claims by replicating their main results with open-source SAEs for Llama 3.1. While we successfully reproduce basic feature extraction and steering capabilities, our investigation suggests that major caution is warranted regarding the generalizability of these claims. We find that feature steering exhibits substantial fragility, with sensitivity to layer selection, steering magnitude, and context. We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output.

This alleviates the KV-cache memory bottleneck, supporting high-concurrency serving without specialized hardware. Theoretically, we analyze the rate-distortion tradeoff of fused cache blocks under a Poisson process model. Empirically, our method achieves up to 4.38 $\\times$ KV-cache compression with negligible accuracy loss across diverse LLMs and benchmarks, outperforming recent structured and adaptive compression baselines. In real LLM serving, joint encoding improves the token throughput by $\\sim$40\\% on a single-machine vLLM benchmark, demonstrating substantial gains in inference throughput.

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability.

Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u63a9\u7801\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a9\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6574\u4f53\u5206\u5272\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4f4d\u7f6e\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u8272\u677f\u548c2D\u683c\u96f7\u7801\u6392\u5e8f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0tanh\u6fc0\u6d3b\u51fd\u6570\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u6563\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528sigmoid\u635f\u5931\u52a0\u6743\u548cx-prediction\u4f18\u5316\u6269\u6563\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u867d\u7136\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5c1a\u672a\u8d85\u8d8a\u9886\u5148\u7684\u63a9\u7801\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u5907\u539f\u7406\u6027\u6a21\u7cca\u5efa\u6a21\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u4ece\u5934\u5f00\u59cb\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u53ef\u63d0\u793a\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6709\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $\u0394$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \\textsc{CivilComments} and \\textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\\varepsilon=0.02$ for \\textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs.

Recent state-of-the-art methods leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide detailed moment descriptions for video data.

During inference, in order to properly determine the output caption sequence from an arbitrary number of events presented within a video, we introduce an event coherent sampling strategy to select event captions with sufficient coherence across temporal events and cross-modal similarity with the given video.

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage.

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization.

Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards. By integrating ergonomic structure with transformer-based linguistic reasoning, MyoText advances the feasibility of seamless, wearable neural input for future ubiquitous computing environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MyoText\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e2d\u4ecb\u9636\u6bb5\u5c06\u8868\u9762\u808c\u7535\u56fe(sEMG)\u4fe1\u53f7\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u572830\u540d\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8685.4%\u7684\u624b\u6307\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u30015.4%\u7684\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u548c6.5%\u7684\u5355\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u65e0\u9700\u952e\u76d8\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4ece\u795e\u7ecf\u808c\u8089\u4fe1\u53f7\u5230\u6587\u672c\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528CNN-BiLSTM-Attention\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u591a\u901a\u9053sEMG\u5206\u7c7b\u624b\u6307\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u6253\u5b57\u5148\u9a8c\u63a8\u65ad\u5b57\u6bcd\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684T5\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u53e5\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728emg2qwerty\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u768430\u540d\u7528\u6237\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cMyoText\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u624b\u6307\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523085.4%\uff0c\u5b57\u7b26\u9519\u8bef\u73875.4%\uff0c\u5355\u8bcd\u9519\u8bef\u73876.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "MyoText\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4eba\u4f53\u5de5\u7a0b\u5b66\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u666e\u9002\u8ba1\u7b97\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u65e0\u7f1d\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u795e\u7ecf\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework. Building on DCDW, we develop two scenario-specific fusion strategies: (1) for balanced quality distributions, Collaboration Fusion Module (CFM) mines pairwise consensus features to capture shared discriminative information and boost intra-class consistency; (2) for unbalanced distributions, Guidance Fusion Module (GFM) implements differential amplification of modal discriminative disparities to reinforce dominant modality advantages, guide auxiliary modalities to mine complementary discriminative info, and mitigate inter-modal divergence to boost multi-modal joint decision performance.

SC has been successful in diverse applications, but existing methods typically treat the ordering of pre-intervention time indices interchangeable.

We propose Time-Aware Synthetic Control (TASC), which employs a state-space model with a constant trend while preserving a low-rank structure of the signal. TASC uses the Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother: it first fits a generative time-series model with expectation-maximization and then performs counterfactual inference.

Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework.

In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models.

Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss.

Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions. With this engine, we create a public dataset of 30 million transactions from 23,000 users and a benchmark suite with two tasks, illiquidity classification and identity theft segmentation.

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs.

This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA.

While it enhances the generalization capabilities by suppressing high-frequency noise, it can be a limitation in scientific tasks that require capturing fine-scale structures. The delayed generalization phenomenon known as grokking is another barrier to rapid training of neural networks. Grokking has been hypothesized to arise as learning transitions from the NTK to the feature-rich regime. This paper explores the impact of preconditioned gradient descent (PGD), such as Gauss-Newton, on spectral bias and grokking phenomena. We demonstrate through theoretical and empirical results how PGD can mitigate issues associated with spectral bias. Additionally, building on the rich learning regime grokking hypothesis, we study how PGD can be used to reduce delays associated with grokking. Our conjecture is that PGD, without the impediment of spectral bias, enables uniform exploration of the parameter space in the NTK regime. Our experimental results confirm this prediction, providing strong evidence that grokking represents a transitional behavior between the lazy regime characterized by the NTK and the rich regime.

Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation.

In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO).

We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones.

To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making.

To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cMotoTimePressure\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u7535\u52a8\u4e24\u8f6e\u8f66\u9a91\u624b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u78b0\u649e\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e72\u9884\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u5bf9\u7535\u52a8\u4e24\u8f6e\u8f66\u9a91\u624b\u7684\u5371\u9669\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u4e8b\u6545\u503e\u5411\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u4e86153\u6b21\u9a91\u884c\u3001129,000\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6db5\u76d663\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MotoTimePressure\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5377\u79ef\u9884\u5904\u7406\u3001\u53cc\u9636\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u548cSqueeze-and-Excitation\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u5bfc\u81f4\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u9ad848%\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u589e\u52a036.4%\uff0c\u4ea4\u53c9\u53e3\u5371\u9669\u8f6c\u5f2f\u589e\u52a058%\uff0c\u6025\u5239\u8f66\u589e\u52a036%\uff0c\u540e\u5239\u8f66\u529b\u589e\u52a050%\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523091.53%\uff0cROC AUC\u4e3a98.93%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u516b\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65f6\u95f4\u538b\u529b\u9884\u6d4b\u53ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u5982\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8b66\u62a5\u3001\u89e6\u89c9\u53cd\u9988\u548c\u901f\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u4e24\u8f6e\u8f66\u51fa\u884c\u3002"}}

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set. Finally, region-evidence VLM adversarial labeling pairs a proposer (multi-granularity regions and semantic cues) with a validator (global and local chained consistency) to produce explainable labels and close the loop. On realistic corner-case scenarios (e.g., flooded-car inspection), ReCCur runs on consumer-grade GPUs, steadily improves purity and separability, and requires minimal human supervision, providing a practical substrate for downstream training and evaluation under resource constraints.

SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning.

While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \\propto \\mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.\n  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.\n  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b97\u5b50\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u526a\u679d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6982\u7387\u57df\u7b97\u5b50\u65b9\u9762\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u8868\u5f81\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u71b5\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u7b49\u516c\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u7406\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u7c7b\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u6210\u7acb\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u65e0\u5173\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u8fed\u4ee3\u526a\u679d\u6210\u529f\u800c\u5355\u6b21\u526a\u679d\u5931\u8d25\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86O(1/n)\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u575a\u5b9e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ed1\u76d2\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples.

Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions.

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur.

While often attributed to data scale, we propose that this limitation arises from the intrinsic circuit complexity of the architecture. We formalize spatial understanding as learning a Group Homomorphism: mapping image sequences to a latent space that preserves the algebraic structure of the underlying transformation group. We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\\mathsf{TC^0} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures.

Under review at ICLR 2026", "summary": "Machine unlearning in text-to-image diffusion models aims to remove targeted concepts while preserving overall utility. Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness.

Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods.

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86epiplexity\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u80fd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u63cf\u8ff0\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u606f\u7406\u8bba\uff08\u5982\u9999\u519c\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u67ef\u5c14\u83ab\u54e5\u6d1b\u592b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff09\u5047\u8bbe\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5177\u6709\u65e0\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u63cf\u8ff0\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e09\u4e2a\u770b\u4f3c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u53d8\u6362\u4e0d\u80fd\u589e\u52a0\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u4f3c\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u4ec5\u662f\u5206\u5e03\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165epiplexity\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u8ba1\u7b97\u6709\u9650\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u80fd\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6392\u9664\u65f6\u95f4\u6709\u754c\u71b5\uff08\u5982\u4f2a\u968f\u673a\u6570\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u6df7\u6c8c\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5185\u5bb9\uff09\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u5b9e\u7528\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1epiplexity\u3002", "result": "\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba1\u7b97\u521b\u9020\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5982\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f3c\u7136\u5efa\u6a21\u5982\u4f55\u4ea7\u751f\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u672c\u8eab\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002epiplexity\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u51fa\u6539\u5584\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "epiplexity\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u751f\u6210\u6216\u8f6c\u6362\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u539f\u5219\u5f62\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002"}}

Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components.

Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets.

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility.

However, their inherently multiple step inference process imposes substantial computational overhead, hindering real-world deployment. Accelerating diffusion models is therefore essential, yet determining how to combine multiple model acceleration techniques remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we introduce a framework driven by large language models (LLMs) for automated acceleration code generation and evaluation. First, we present DiffBench, a comprehensive benchmark that implements a three stage automated evaluation pipeline across diverse diffusion architectures, optimization combinations and deployment scenarios. Second, we propose DiffAgent, an agent that generates optimal acceleration strategies and codes for arbitrary diffusion models. DiffAgent employs a closed-loop workflow in which a planning component and a debugging component iteratively refine the output of a code generation component, while a genetic algorithm extracts performance feedback from the execution environment to guide subsequent code refinements.

To address this gap, we introduce AnatomiX, a multitask multimodal large language model explicitly designed for anatomically grounded chest X-ray interpretation.

Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that AnatomiX achieves superior anatomical reasoning and delivers over 25% improvement in performance on anatomy grounding, phrase grounding, grounded diagnosis and grounded captioning tasks compared to existing approaches.

We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG.

We introduce LTX-2, an open-source foundational model capable of generating high-quality, temporally synchronized audiovisual content in a unified manner. LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability.

However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edfMultiMedia-Agent\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5173\u8054\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u4e09\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524dAIGC\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAIGC\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u5404\u9886\u57df\u6709\u6240\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4f46\u5927\u591a\u53ea\u80fd\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u5305\u542b\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiMedia-Agent\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6280\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7ba1\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5173\u8054\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u81ea\u5173\u8054\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u5173\u8054\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u5212\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u7840/\u6210\u529f\u8ba1\u5212\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee3\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0cMultiMedia-Agent\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u6bd4\u65b0\u9896\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ee3\u7406\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0cMultiMedia-Agent\u5728\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3aAIGC\u6280\u672f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.
